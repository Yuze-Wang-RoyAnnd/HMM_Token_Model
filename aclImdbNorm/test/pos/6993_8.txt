this was a "sleeper" for sure!! much better than i thought! never realizing it was a horror flick.....and who was this gorgeous,baritoned voiced hunk, named vin diesel..adding spice and intrigue to this otherwise unpromoted film ??? the monsters in this film were quite unusual, not the same ol run of the mill gobble-you-up types!!the ending was great, too, for a change, not all "bad guys are bad"!!! i give it 2 thumbs up !!!
