this interesting lost film (written by terence malick) stars stacy keach and frederic forrest as two wacky, southern brothers on a quest to open a seafood restaurant. margot kidder was never prettier and forrest should have been nominated. originally titled the dion brothers, this light-hearted flick with a violent ending is a pure joy! <br /><br />where is this film? i've been searching for it for 30 years. keach was still great back then and i'm surprised it doesn't have more of a cult following (maybe it does). these guys are a crack-up with more ambition than brains, but totally lovable dudes!. a 7 out of 10. if you can dig it up somewhere, you'll have fun.
