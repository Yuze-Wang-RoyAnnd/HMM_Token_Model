i bought my first zep album in 1974 (at 17) and have been hooked ever since. this dvd has now taken pride of place in my music collection. it is not often that a band can boast 4 virtuosos in their lineup but here we can. each member made their own contribution to the band but on the stage together, the electricity they generated was bigger than the 4 individuals. this masterpiece covers the band's entire career from led zep 1 to coda and this is captured magnificently on this dvd as each concert shows how the band became bigger and bigger over the years. recently my copy disappeared, but i'm happy to say was found in my 17yo son's room as the new generation discover just how great these guys were. this is a must have for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music. long live led zeppelin.
