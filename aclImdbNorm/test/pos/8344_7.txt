this movie is apparently intended for a young, evangelical christian audience as a teaching tool. for that i give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. it's a decent movie to show a youth group, but i don't think it will be very well received beyond that. for any other audience, i'd rate it lots lower.<br /><br />the reviewers that saw "it's a wonderful life" in this were right on, though i didn't think of that until they mentioned it. i was more reminded of a "chick tract", those little 3" by 5" gospel comic books. if jack chick ever made a movie out of one of his tracts, it would probably look a lot like "second glance." it has a strong christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth, but it is somewhat hampered by christian stereotypes. the christians are all very nice, somewhat passive, and squeaky clean, while all of the non-christians seem to be bad people.<br /><br />muriel the angel plays a major part, and he is the corniest, cheesiest character in the film. he is the most unlikeable angel i have ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. i don't know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly, or if he just struck me that way. (i admit that he reminded me of someone i know.) dan's love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie. why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that i wish had been answered.<br /><br />but the movie does display positive christian values, and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson.
