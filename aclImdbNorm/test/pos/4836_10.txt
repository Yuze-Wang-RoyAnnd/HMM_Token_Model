i first saw this movie about 3 years ago. i was shocked at how stupid the fbi was not to prevent such a tragedy. it could have been easily prevented. this movie was just unbelievable.<br /><br />now seeing it after september 11th, i am appalled and can say that this could have been prevented more easily that most people would want to know.<br /><br />this film is 100% true<br /><br />in the final scene of the film, when the mastermind of the 1st attack is being taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers, he makes a spine chilling remark, that was laughed at when he said it. "next time we'll bring them *both* down." this was actually said by ramzi yousef after his arrest.<br /><br />this movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the noses of the fbi and nypd. it shows how the 1st and 4th amendments are partially to blame for the attacks.<br /><br />i watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented.
