this almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way. real lighting. real sound. less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies. and while there is very little script, there is a story. shot in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing. he has a place to live that he makes his own, has a good job, and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe. the people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which i didn't know about. they mostly seem decent and pay ale what seems like daily, seeming truly concerned about his well being. the actor (i think) playing ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine. this reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish. it shows what kids are capable of, even without much support and love. definitely recommend.
