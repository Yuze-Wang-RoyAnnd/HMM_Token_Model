this is a hollywood film. the credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. this film will not change the world. however, it is well-made, well-plotted, and well-acted, which counts for a lot.<br /><br />it's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former-cia assassin who feels betrayed chasing a secret service agent who was protecting john f. kennedy when kennedy was killed in dallas. the agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary america, this would-be assassin mitch leary (john malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the president. he imagines he has common cause with secret service agent frank horrigan (clint eastwood at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the warren commission, blamed horrigan-unfairly, leary believes-for the assassination of president kennedy. the tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from leary to horrigan-leary wanting to keep horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans.<br /><br />rene russo is excellent as lily raines a fellow agent with whom horrigan develops a grown- up relationship. it is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if russo is a fair deal younger than eastwood at the time of filming). russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted horrigan in friendly banter. it is a nice part for russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. the acting by the leads, wolfgang peterson's competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film i can watch over and over.
