i love military comedies (sgt. bilko, stripes, in the army now, major payne) and down periscope is hilarious, but it has a heart as well.<br /><br />the stingray ss-161 (the uss pampanito) was gorgeous. absolutely beautiful, a piece of art come alive. so it was a diesel engine sub, so what? i learned that the aircraft carrier uss ranger (which stood in for the enterprise in star trek iv), a huge ship, was 'conventionally powered', which might mean that ranger was a diesel too.<br /><br />my favorite scene: pascal: jesus, buckman, this can's been on the stingray since korea! this can expired in 1966! buckman: (takes finger full and tastes it) what's the matter, sir? it still tastes like creamed corn.<br /><br />pascal: (yelling) except, it's deviled ham!! buckman: that would be a problem.<br /><br />it's story, perhaps a wee strained, seemed plausible. winslow respected dodge, and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give dodge a chance. he gave him a battered but still seaworthy balao-class sub, and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear navy and 'attack' charlston harbor, and norfolk. 2-star admiral graham (with his eye on his third star, and a grudge against dodge) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping that they would screw up so dodge would lose. can tom dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team, and can he take an old, out of date sub, and beat the navy's best?
