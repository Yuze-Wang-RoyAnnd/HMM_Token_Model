francis ford coppola's first 'personal' film, completed and released in 1969, was the last movie he made as a mostly unknown, up and coming director before the godfather, and is in stark contrast to both that film, and the rest of his uneven career. it's ostensibly a road movie involving a disconnected young woman bored with domestic life, and pregnant with a child she isn't sure she wants, fleeing the trappings her dull marriage and hitting the open road in search of freedom. along the way she befriends a nice man, an ex-footballer player that suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury, played in unexpectedly subtle fashion by a young james caan, and decides to 'help' him, despite becoming frustrated with his simple ways. her efforts to rid of him always fail, either by guilt or chance, and eventually lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop(robert duvall), who has ideas of his own. the plot is threadbare, but coppola does a great job at detailing the emotional life of these characters, and uses editing techniques to relay back story that were not at all common in american films of the time. shots are simple, yet extraordinarily effective, conveying both the moody desolation of the open highway, and the emptiness of american suburban life, infused with a gentle melancholy provided by the film score. coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from a woman's point of view in the culturally turbulent 60's. overall, a fairly low-key film that is not what audiences have come to expect from coppola, but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet, unassuming way. 7.5/10.
