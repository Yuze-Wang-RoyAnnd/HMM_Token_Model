so funny is the perfect way to describe this 12 minutes spoof of the original star wars. hardware wars is incredibly funny. it is presented as the trailer of the space epic hardware wars. the joke is this: imagine star wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. the characters include the "intergalactic boy-wonder" fluke starbucker, the "ace mercenary and intergalactic wise guy" ham salad, darph nader, "villain" and a host of other fantastic characters. it is impossible not to laugh as you watch this 12 minutes treasure. it's stupid but it's fun. you will laugh from the start to the end, and you will feel the need to watch it again, and again, and again, and again... and you will laugh every time you see it!!!<br /><br />10 out of 10. the funniest 12 minutes ever made. you will believe it lasted a minute!
