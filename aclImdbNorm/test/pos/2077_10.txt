i saw this version of hamlet on television many years ago, and have seen every other version since, whether television or movie. however, this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me. most excellent derek jacobi made hamlet *real* for me. before i saw this version, shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and i never tried to understand the elizabethan english. having seen jacobi's hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature, but also that of my family. i promptly checked the play out of library and read it, and poured over the accompanying recording. jacobi's rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge. and yet, i have been searing for a video of it for years and years to no avail. it gets a very high rating from viewers. why, then, has it not been released on video? it's the only hamlet that i'd invest in...
