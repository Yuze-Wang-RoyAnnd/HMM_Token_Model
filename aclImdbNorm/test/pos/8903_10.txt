wow! it's even better than i expected! the best animated ast'erix movie ever! and it feels so good to hear roger carel doing the voice of ast'erix again! i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of ast'erix! but i suggest that you go to see the french version, cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast! did you know that roger carel has played ast'erix for nearly forty years? i think he did a marvelous job! and the song from c'eline dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful... in a word: a masterpiece! go to see it! you will not regret this!
