one of the best! as being a fan of the civil war, i was very pleased with the first installment of the north and south trilogy. patrick swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as james reed and leslie ann down. in watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. i was first introduced to this series when i was in the eighth grade. being a young boy, you would think that i wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap. to be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book. i bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome. i am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war. as a movie director of the future, i will always enjoy north and south: book one.
