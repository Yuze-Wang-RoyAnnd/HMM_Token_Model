this is a really good flick with awesome humor. jim verney as we know was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates a lot of it in this movie.this is definitely the best of the ernest films.i would surely recommend it to any ernest fan out there.i find myself to have great taste in movies and i'm sure anyone will enjoy this movie. in the movie ,(ernest) plays 2 roles, bad guy and good guy and plays them quite well. i really enjoy exaggeration type humor where things just seem impossible,like in the naked gun films for example, and there is plenty of it in this movie.i bought this movie right after i saw it. good directing, good script, worth renting.
