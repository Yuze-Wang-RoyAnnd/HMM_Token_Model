this film stars peter lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to america. unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned. because he looks so awful, no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation, he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. where exactly the film goes from there, you'll just need to see for yourself.<br /><br />i scored this movie an 8 because, for the money spent to make it, it's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting. the film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film, but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises. in addition, the excellent acting by lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles. this is an excellent film and delivers more than most "a-pictures" of the day.
