one life stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves. its imdb rating of 1.7 doesn't do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. shot on digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget. the performances are excellent, particularly that of gary lewis who gets better with every role. my only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments. overall, though, it is a fine piece of work.
