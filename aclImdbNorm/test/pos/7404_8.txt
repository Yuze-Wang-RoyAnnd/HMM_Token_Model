sometimes good things happen by accident.<br /><br />i'd never heard of "silverwing" until late 2005--i was flipping channels and happened to see something on toon disney with bats in a sawmill being attacked by owls. i had no idea what it was, but i was motivated to stay tuned--it was hard waiting for a commercial so i could find out what it was called!<br /><br />part of what intrigued me was the looks of the bats--first of all, they didn't use the popular convention of giving the bats "extra fingers" where their thumb claws are supposed to be. rather, they have palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have webs of skin between them.<br /><br />also the faces--they look like human beings (in fact, at one point i wondered if they had once been human but were transformed into bats). ordinarily i don't like this in cartoon animals, but it worked here--the story is a human story, even though it's about bats and other animals (not unlike the lion king).<br /><br />what i saw on tv were the last two parts of the "trilogy." i'd missed the very beginning of the first one, "towers of fire" (the second overall), but for the most part i saw all of each of them. however, i found myself wanting to understand what was going on, since the first part hadn't been on and i wouldn't have caught it anyway.<br /><br />but i saw that it was based on a book by kenneth oppel. how fortunate that i paid attention and wrote it down--i was very disappointed when i learned that the series wasn't available! it wasn't even that recently made that it made sense for it not to be available yet.<br /><br />however, i did find not only the book silverwing, but also the two sequels sunwing and firewing. when i read the first book, i was left wondering "is that it?" not only because a lot of what's in the series isn't in that book, but even had i not seen the animated version, the book silverwing (otherwise a good story) doesn't end so much as it stops. only one loose end is tied up--shade and marina meet the silverwing colony at hibernaculum.<br /><br />in fact, silverwing and sunwing should have (in my opinion) been published in a single volume, because they make for a complete story together, but not separately.<br /><br />actually, the animated version takes some elements from sunwing (e. g., orestes, the lifting of the ban from seeing the sun) and some were completely original. it's not perfect, but it's definitely very enjoyable. i enjoy both versions of the silverwing saga.<br /><br />which is why i'm glad it's finally going to be available in june. it was a long time coming, and it's well worth the wait.
