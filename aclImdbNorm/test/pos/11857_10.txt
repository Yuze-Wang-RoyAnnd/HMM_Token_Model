why this film was only released in 4 states is beyond me. i thought this film was a divine story. the name says it all: seeing other people. this movie has more logic than laughs, which i suppose is why it works so well. common sense also makes an appearance in what would seem to be another puerile sex comedy. alice is getting her feet frozen in the cold, when she feels irrationally about the way she might perform for her fianc'e, not just sexually, but as a partner, and friend etc. this starts what seems to be an almost archetypal journey for the both of them. one fling after another leads to trouble, as if it wasn't a bad idea from the start. witty dialogue and comic set-ups make this one funny as hell! nicholson and mohr set the tone of the film early on, and keep the promise they anticipate. other highlights are lauren graham, andy richter, and helen slater(in her first theatrical film in 10 years!). climax begins to take an insane turn, but a simple ending makes this one far more enjoyable than most movies today. mohr fans will see something different in his ed character, and fans of helen slater will enjoy her shiny moments of a quick, but excellent come-back. any richter takes home the award for most moralistic character. romantic and funny, or just plain fun. seeing other people is a gem, which needs to be noticed.
