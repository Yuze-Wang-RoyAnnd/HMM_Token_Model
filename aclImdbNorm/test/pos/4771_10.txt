it's the 1920s. and a man named walt disney was on a mission: to satisfy the families and children all over the world with one thing: entertainment. what did he do? he made cartoons! whoo!!!!! and he made a character that is as great as a mouse...mickey mouse. ha ha! oh boy!<br /><br />two films were drawn out by mr. disney himself: "plane crazy" and "steamboat willie." this review will focus on the 1928 feature, "steamboat willie."<br /><br />ever since i learned about this movie as a little boy, i've always wanted to see this movie. well, in 1997, i rented an ancient vhs that had lots of old disney cartoons on them, starring the mouse!!!!! mickey mouse!!!!! and guess what? that short was on there, and i loved it!!!!! shortly after i took the tape back, this was playing on the old disney channel (note: the "old" disney channel) early one saturday morning.<br /><br />yes, this is a great cartoon; this paved the way for more great disney stuff from 1928 to 2002!<br /><br />10 stars, indeed!!!!!
