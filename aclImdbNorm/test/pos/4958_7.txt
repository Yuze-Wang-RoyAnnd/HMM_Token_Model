i'm sorry, but i just can't help it, i love watching iron eagle. now, do not misunderstand me, i am not saying that this is a great movie. no, rather, i would put it that this is an endlessly entertaining movie. for people who cut this movie to pieces for not being realistic are kinda missing the point. of course iron eagle's plot was ridiculous. but i believe its target audience was kids, and i sure remember finding this cool when i was little. now i just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure, kinda like road house. this movie is part of the great pantheon of 80's, kids-taking-on-the-stodgy-adult-power-structure movies. you must remember d.a.r.y.l, real genius, e.t., etc. if you ask me, just watching doug and knotcher "ride the snake" in the beginning is worth the cost of the dvd. that whole sequence was so stupid! but, at the same time, it was hilarious, funny, totally 80's, all that good stuff. so bottom line, iron eagle is a great 80's guilty pleasure. the hairstyles, the dancing, the music, the dialogue, its all funny as hell. i have iron eagle on dvd and to me it was totally worth $9.99 at best buy. if you love laughing at dated, unrealistic action movies, this one is a must-see. oh yeah, and i think its plot was only marginally stupider than 1986's other fighter pilot action pic, top gun.
