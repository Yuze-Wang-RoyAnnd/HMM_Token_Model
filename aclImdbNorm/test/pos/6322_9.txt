a variation of the same plot line was used in a simon & simon episode (thin air) that originally aired in dec 1982.<br /><br />the gender of the victim was changed, the surviving spouse is one of rick's "old flames". it's also interesting to note that gerald mcraney had a role in this rockford file episode. <br /><br />both episodes were based on a story by howard browne - as noted in the list of 'writing credits'. <br /><br />anthony james plays one of his classic tv bad guy roles.<br /><br />the continuation of the concept between the rockford files to magnum pi to simon & simon quite interesting.
