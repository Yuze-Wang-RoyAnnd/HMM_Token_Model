after clocking up five seasons on the small screen from 1976-79, 'george & mildred' transferred themselves to the big screen in mid 1980. instead of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke retaining their roles as writers, dick sharples was brought on board as the writer. sadly, this film adaption just did not seem to hit the spot with the public. shame. i liked it, better than the series itself in fact. it was a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />'mildred roper' (yootha joyce) is keen to ascertain whether or not her slovenly husband 'george' (brian murphy) has remembered their wedding anniversary. obviously, he hasn't, but to try and convince his wife otherwise he books a table at the restaurant where he proposed marriage to mildred several years ago.<br /><br />upon arriving at the restaurant, they find out that the place has changed hands. eventually seeing through george's lies, mildred insists that they celebrate their anniversary at a swanky hotel. upon arriving at the hotel, george is mistaken by crook 'harry pinto' (stratford johns) for a ruthless hit-man, who wants a rival to be exterminated!<br /><br />not an outstanding comedy as such but a good natured piece of fun all the same. plans to revive the series after the film's showing were sadly terminated when yootha joyce died on 24th august 1980 of alcohol poisoning.<br /><br />funniest moment- george talking to his favourite garden gnome. his neighbour, tristram creeps up behind him and says ''i think its time we had a chat''. george, thinking it has developed the power of speech, drops the gnome in shock!<br /><br />merry christmas to fellow imdb users, in particular 'adamfontaine', 'cyril blake' and 'thelittlesongbird'. have a good one!
