only the brits could make a film like this and have it be so tastefully charming! betty (brenda blethyn) wants something more out of life, but she doesn't know what, when she realizes she is in love with her childhood friend, boris (alfred molina), who owns the local funeral parlor. meanwhile, an american mortician (christopher walken) who "wants to put the 'fun' back in funerals" moves into this small welsh community with his assistant (lee evans) and wants to give boris a run for his money with flashy, themed funerals. (star trek funeral, anyone?) brenda and boris decide to stage brenda's death and funeral, with hilarious results. a very enjoyable film - if you're a fan of british comedies such as "waking ned devine", you'll love this.
