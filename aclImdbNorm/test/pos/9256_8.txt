this is the final episode we deserved. at the end of the last season, things were left in a 'life goes on' mood, which was hardly the wrap-up that this realistic series deserved. while not a happy show, this series was always one that made you think (a rare thing on television), and this is no exception. 'is death justified by reasoning?' 'are morals reflective of society, or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power?' 'what is a just death, and can it exist?' all of these questions, and more, are posed by the writers of this show every week, and this is their final thesis. fine acting, great writing, wonderful camera-work, brilliant editing, clean direction. if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran, then get a hold on a copy somehow. if you never watched the series when it ran, then this will stand up on its own, but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts. for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons, this is very satisfying viewing.
