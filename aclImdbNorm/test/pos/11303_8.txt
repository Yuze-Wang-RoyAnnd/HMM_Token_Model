for once a barbie movie that is good. i'm 18 and a embarrassed to say this but i'm hooked on these movies. i hated barbie when i was younger but the movies i love. shiver is so cute and i've fallen in love with him. he's so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with aiden. oh man i'm in love with shiver. i love annika determination not to give up on hope and eventfully it works. i love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones. barbie & swan lake is other brilliant movie. i would recommend this movie to children of all ages (even boys) because the movie is that good and i'm hard to please. barbie and the magic of pegasus is a movie that is enchanting and exciting.
