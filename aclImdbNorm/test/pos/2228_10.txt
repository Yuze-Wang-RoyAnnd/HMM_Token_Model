i remember seeing this film in my late teens or early twenties on tv - probably hbo. i watched it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. since that was about 30 years ago, i don't remember a lot of the story. i do remember that the entire group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen. when it was over, our bellies hurt from so much laughing. my dad worked at a hospital, so that made it all the better.<br /><br />every time i see the party in the tv listings, i look to see if this one is there, too. to my dismay, it never is. although i loved the party, i feel this one is funnier. peter sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator. why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me. it's a classic, but it appears that nobody under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. i'd buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd.
