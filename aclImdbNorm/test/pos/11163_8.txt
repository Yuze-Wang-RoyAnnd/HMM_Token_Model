currently playing at the 2007 german film festival in australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to peanutqueen and especially ariesgemini for her rundown on the actors in this ensemble cast.<br /><br />in australia these movies were sub-titled in english and while french movies here often get a mainstream release, german movies are still to gather that sort of commercial audience. but like bmws and mercedes when germans get it right i really like their films. like pq the time here went so quickly, lots of laughs from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time.<br /><br />while many films are overlong this one i could have watched much more of. it had the sort of characters and character development for a series. given time i will re-read ariesgemini100 review and reference the actors i liked and their other work with a view to keeping an eye out from them. i agree....most of these actors will go onto bigger and better things. some very good character actors in this fine film. i did see it in the program listed as a mockumentary. mock or otherwise it felt very real. and quite romantic in it's way.<br /><br />viva la deutcsh!
