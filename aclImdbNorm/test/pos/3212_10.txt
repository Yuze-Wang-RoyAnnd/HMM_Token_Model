i have watched this show from the beginning, and i am a 45 year old man. to me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. this is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. it centers around a mother and daughter, lorelei and rory gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. lorelei makes her home in fictional stars hollow, ct, a small new england town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family. the show also throws in the relationship between lorelei and her parents, richard and emily gilmore, old money dar wasp people who do not approve of lorelei's choices in life, though lorelei doesn't care. the relationships story and through line are what makes this show, in my opinion the finest on the wb network (soon to be the cw). watch this show!
