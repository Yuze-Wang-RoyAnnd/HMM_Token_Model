...a true geek-girl's dream: high tech, high drama, smart guys, steamy sex, and large explosions. (very large explosions.) sam waterston is so natural in the role of oppenheimer that tapes of the real oppenheimer sound odd: apparently, he had a voice similar to ronald reagan! the triumph and tragedy of oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most stirring dramas, and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, not to call attention to themselves. an interesting fact: some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified, and so are of special interest. a must-see!
