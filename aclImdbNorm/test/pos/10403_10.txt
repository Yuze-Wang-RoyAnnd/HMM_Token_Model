i, for one, absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />it is not a "typical asian horror" where you would see a gruesome looking ghost (usually a woman) that is going around scaring people. you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius. this is not the movie for you if you're into gore (e.g. saw, hostel) or "surprise scares" where stuff pops out at you (hollywood horror, slasher films), but this movie has an underlying "creepy" factor throughout the entire movie which i loved. noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today's society.<br /><br />please don't let the documentary-style of filming turn you off (why should it?!). it is far superior to the blair witch project because, for one, the acting in noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing.<br /><br />noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror; and this movie holds a solid #1 spot on my list.
