america's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.<br /><br />cycle 1: yeah i'm happy adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.<br /><br />cycle 2: its too bad, i think mercedes deserved it.<br /><br />cycle 3: i did not like eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.<br /><br />cycle 4: kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in naima, but i definitely know what they saw in kahlen.<br /><br />cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either. but out of all the girls, nicole as a winner? eww!<br /><br />cycle 6: i liked sara and joanie, but danielle is okay too.<br /><br />cycle 7: caridee definitely deserved it.<br /><br />cycle 8: no, i didn't want jaslene to win. i didn't like her. i saw other girls in that cycle with definitely more potential than her, although i did not see much of this cycle.<br /><br />good show, i've just seen it too many times to like it much anymore :d
