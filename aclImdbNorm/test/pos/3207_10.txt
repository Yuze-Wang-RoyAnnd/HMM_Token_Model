i'm not the type of person to watch t.v. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or too dramatic! but this show is perfect. everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. everyone has their own personality and lorelai gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. rory gilmore is a good role model for all girls. she takes pride in wanting to attend harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. she's a loyal friend and always the peace maker. there's subtle romance which is what i like, personally. not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. every character eventually gets it, and they don't find their prince charming at first glance and they don't just "fall in love" with every guy that comes their way. it's a realistic show but when you watch it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture, and random facts because lorelai gilmore is always making references. i fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, so will you.
