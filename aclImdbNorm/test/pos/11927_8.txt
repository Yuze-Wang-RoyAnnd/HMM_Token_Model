this came as a huge surprise for me. i had never heard of this movie when i first saw it, and the title really pointed towards something else than a great terrorist/hostage situation at a high school. toy soldiers has the best from it's time period of the early 90's, where action movies were light-hearted and very enjoyable. the action is good, the plot is interesting and way over the top, the bad guy is a one-dimensional hateful douchebag (which is great), louis gossett jr. is in it, it's simply a feel-good movie which i thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />you can't go wrong with this one if you like action. i give it a solid rating of 8/10.
