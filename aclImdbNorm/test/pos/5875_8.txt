this film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. a triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as "the deer hunter.") i like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.<br /><br />the tale is a simple one. three very different servicemen who have mustered out after world war ii (the big one!) fly home to their midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. one has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.<br /><br />there are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. fredric march won the best actor oscar for playing an old sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. personally, i think jimmy stewart deserved it for "it's a wonderful life," which also deserved the best picture award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. as i said, it was fashionable. march has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real wwii hero pappy boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.<br /><br />i am going against the grain here, but i thought that myrna loy, who played march's wife, was justly ignored by the academy. i detected barely a hint of warmth from her. in fact, i kept thinking she was going to slap frederic march for annoying her. she practically grimaced every time they were together. something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. i think all this nonsense about her being "the perfect wife" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. you may disagree with that, but the academy voters apparently did not. she is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.<br /><br />dana andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. he is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. but then he chances upon march's daughter peggy (teresa wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, "i'm going to bust that marriage up!" the romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />speaking of uplifting, now we come to harold russell. he has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. his best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. "i'm lucky, i still have my elbows unlike some of the boys." truly great stuff.<br /><br />the film has some moments that soar. it also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.
