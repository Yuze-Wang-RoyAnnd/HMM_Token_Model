i agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie. i read the book as a sophomore in high school in sumter sc. i instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series. as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done, i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. i was glad the orry was not killed off like he was in love and war or n&s ii.<br /><br />having grown up in sc and graduating from university of sc, i fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book. i had the honor of meeting john jakes at a symposium in 1988 at usc. i stayed around afterwards and meet mr.jakes. unfortunately, i did not get to ask him a question. but meeting him was honor enough. i majored in accounting but got my minor in southern studies. in addition, i patterned a lot of my mannerisms after orry main. orry and myself are very much alike. i feel i was born 150 years too late. i am a southern gentleman and very proud of this.<br /><br />well i fell in love with 2 women in the movie....genie francis and wendy kilbourne. man, did i have the hots for wendy!!!! i never quite could find a real life version of her. i hope one day too!!!
