jeff lieberman's "just before dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made.the film,whilst a little bit influenced by "deliverance" and "the texas chain saw massacre",is extremely creepy and memorable.the suspense almost never lets up and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie.the cast is excellent,deborah benson and jamie rose are great female leads.the inbred twins are truly frightening and remorseless killers.the film is beautifully shot-it was actually filmed on location at silver falls state park in oregon.there is very little gore,but one killing,when verchel is stabbed in the groin,is pretty nasty and unpleasant.a must-see for slasher fans.10 out of 10-what else?
