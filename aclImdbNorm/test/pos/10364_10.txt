in my work with the only nationwide non-profit organization, security on campus, inc. dedicated exclusively to the issue of college campus crime prevention and student awareness i see all too often the type of campus violence and `cover-up' through secret campus courts portrayed in the movie `silencing mary.' in fact we receive numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters such as `mary' who are facing similar situations.<br /><br />its depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade by `mary,' the victim's roommate and a student journalist played exceedingly well by melissa joan hart, for justice was very well done and accurately researched.<br /><br />this was the first television movie that i have ever seen that i felt truly reflected and encompassed all of the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our nation's college and university campuses. although it would not be possible to address all of these issues in depth in 2 hours, this movie comes closer than any others i've seen.
