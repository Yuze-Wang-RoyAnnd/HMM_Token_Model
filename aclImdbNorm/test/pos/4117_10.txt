it was a terrific movie! i like to watch it again and again. the actors were awesome. the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. i would recommend this movie to anyone. i wish lifetime would put this movie on dvd. i would most definitely purchase a copy. this movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. you may think you know someone, but you never know. my daughter watched the movie with me. she thought it was great. all i know is, i will watch this movie every time lifetime airs it. it's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the t.v.i wish lifetime would redo the movie, but use the same actors, and bring it to the big screen.
