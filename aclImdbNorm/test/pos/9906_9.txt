this wonderfully witty comedy-drama wowed the crowd at the philadelphia film festival, whipping them into wild applause at its conclusion. buttressed by adept performances by a nuanced cast, sturdy execution by director jeff hare, a brisk pace, and one of peter falk's best performances in years, the film emerges as a loving homage to the highs and woes of family life.<br /><br />falk excels as jewish ninetysomething morris applebaum, a wildly eccentric shakespearean thespian who decides to end his life, but not before rounding up his three grown children and throwing a "big fat jewish suicide party." the film brims with indelible delights. there's morris's "tushy room"; laura san giacomo's passionate rendering of morris's cynical daughter; rapid-fire comedic dialogue that recalls the work of neil simon and woody allen; the wry timing of david paymer, who plays morris's tightly wound psychotherapist son; and morris's patented egg creams (but be careful, drinking them too fast will cause a nasty brain freeze). it's all enveloped in a feel-good, intimate atmosphere set in new york city.<br /><br />director jeff hare proves to be a master craftsman, drawing out memorable performances from his cast and lending the film a mirthful humanity. i was fortunate to see an earlier film by hare: the dark and powerful "perfect little man," starring neal mcdonough ("minority report") as a los angeles man spiraling into madness. the visceral grit of "perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "checking out" are a testament to hare's eclecticism and wide-ranging talent. i'm looking forward to checking out his future work.<br /><br />i heard "checking out" lacks a distributor at this point. some wise company would do well to pick up this crowd-pleasing gem, for it's a potential box-office titan in the vein of "my big fat greek wedding." most nobly, it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie.
