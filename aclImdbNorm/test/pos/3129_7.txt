although i liked this western,i do have to say,it's not one of my favourite john ford westerns.for me,it just lacks a certain something that most of his other films(the ones i have seen anyway)possess)i'm nit sure what that something is.it's not something tangible.anyway,the gist of the story is about a mormon wagon train which is being used by a band of outlaws as a hideout from a pursuing posse.ford employs a lot of his regulars here.there are some interesting characters,some nice scenery,a bit of action,and excitement.it all adds up to a watchable experience.it's certainly not boring.just not quite up to the usual john ford standard.for me,wagon master is a 7/10
