i caught this as part of the cartoon noir package at the clinton street theater in portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.<br /><br />a perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. funny, charming, and touching. a small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. if it's in your town, see it. this one short is worth the price of admission.
