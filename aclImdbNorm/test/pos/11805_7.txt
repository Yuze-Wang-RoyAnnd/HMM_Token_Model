a tale of a young boy, dexter (joseph mazzello) with aids who befriends a rough and tumble boy (played by brad renfro) his exact opposite, the cure is sad, if a bit too soapy, pull at your emotions "message" movie with it's heart in the right place. for that fact alone, it's a recommended view. the highlight might be just watching them finding friendship and hanging out with each other when no one else accepts them. <br /><br />however since the real story centers on the boy's aids - things take off when one day at the local supermarket, dexter's eye catches a checkout tabloid magazine that states a new orleans doctor has discovered the cure. both of them, obviously a tad naive, make it a plan to set out for new orleans in whichever means possible. which kinda pulled me two ways. it's a mite heart warming and i hate to nit-pick, but i found the plot wanders in a melodramatic, predictable sense and the proceedings have a coat of gloss over them like only movies can do. i couldn't escape the tugging notion i was watching a road trip movie about self discovery, sickness and growing up. for instance, i know they're young, but i found it a real task to belief in the things these boys do. like boiling tree leaves and drinking the hot 'tea' or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will combat the ravaging disease. to say nothing of them making a cross-country voyage as they do with no legal or downright scary repercussions. still misgivings aside, those movie conventions you come to expect, it's a story worth seeing particularly with family.
