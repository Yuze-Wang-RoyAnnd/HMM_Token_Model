i started to watch this show by accident, but i love it. the fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. my five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say "like pelswick" and go on with what ever he was originally doing. and yes the animation is a little crude, but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn't that bad. the "genie" is actually an angel who is there to help pelswick learn lessons in life. he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time, i've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). as for the humor if you can get a copy of the "ntalented" episode, which lampoons boy-bands, you will instantly love this show.
