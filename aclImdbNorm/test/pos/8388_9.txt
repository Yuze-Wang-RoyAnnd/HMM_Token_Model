inglorious basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. built on the framework of the dirty dozen, inglorious basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of the dirty dozen to plunge into the action right away. in the process, tarantino fixes one of the dirty dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the nazis were. the nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.<br /><br />bu ditching the training sequences, tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only british, american and german soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of french and german civilians, both collaborators and resistance.<br /><br />it goes without saying that any tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when tarantino made the decision to have the french characters speak french and the germans speak german, beyond adding a level of authenticity, tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in french was as sharp and funny and clever as his english dialogue.<br /><br />case in point, during the opening sequence the nazi "jew hunter" ss colonel hans landa (christian waltz) is interrogating french dairy farmer perrier lapadite (denis menochet). landa suspects that lapadite is hiding a family of jews. while subtly pressuring lapadite, landa asks for a glass of milk. after greedily gulping it down, landa compliments lapadite on his daughters and his cows, "`a votre famille et `a vos vaches, je dis bravo." the thing of it is, in french "vache" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. if reprimanded for this vulgar pun, landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand french well enough to have meant it that way, but landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. and lapadite understands his meaning all too well.<br /><br />that is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. the film is rich with that kind of detail. all of the french and english dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while i can't swear to the german, i would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.<br /><br />inglorious basterds opens with the phrase, "once upon a time... in nazi-occupied france." personally, this reminds me of the opening of every asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied france. like asterix, inglorious basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.<br /><br />in its more serious moments, inglorious basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.<br /><br />tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.<br /><br />if you can see this film as i did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. if you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch.
