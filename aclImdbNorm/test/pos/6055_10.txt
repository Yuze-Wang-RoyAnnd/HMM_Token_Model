i first saw this film in the late 60's, and try to see it every time it comes on tv, which, unfortunately, isn't often. now that i have tcm and fmc, i hope it will be on at least once a year. like louis gossett jr. in an officer and a gentleman, jack webb delivers an unbelievably great performance as a parris island drill sergeant with the classic screw-up recruit, and the story line in this one, though dated, is touching and very well acted. and having real jar-heads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the film as well. it's a great film with top-notch acting and a superb story. see it if you have the chance-it's well worth the time!
