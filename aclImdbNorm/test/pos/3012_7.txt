despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as silence of the lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by vincent d'onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist jennifer lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. this is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-century cgi update of dr who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by d'onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. the inside-the-mind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning, all the leads perform adequately, the gruesomeness is to the max if you like that kind of thing, but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me, as i had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before, not this fairly successful blending of serial-killer and special-effect-horror genre staples. sometimes horrifying, often pretty, a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people, but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as.
