the philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. i'd give it 10 stars for that alone. that being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what i take, possibly incorrectly, to be its art direction. many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated munsell color model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. this makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. i think this movie is genuinely unique for this quality, and if for no other reason, earns it a full, careful, digital restoration. fox, are you listening?
