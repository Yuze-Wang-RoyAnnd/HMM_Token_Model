one of the most magnificent movies ever made. the acting of charles buchinski (later known as bronson) is simply outstanding. this is the crown on the career of director winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. the plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. wildey j. moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to dw3, and rightly so. this is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate. although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the usa, it has found a huge following in europe and asia, where the movie is regularly shown at film schools and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas all across europe. all in all, a true classic.
