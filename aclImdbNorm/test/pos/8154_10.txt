i watched this movie on logo television today. i was absolutely enthralled by the powerful messages and plot line within this film. i don't want to spoil it. i will say this, i related to the inner struggle of aaron and his upbringing. as a gay man growing up in a small town, i related so well to the "big secret" and the choices i made. this movie has made a huge impact on me and i plan on buying a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library. i no more than finished the movie and began calling my friends to recommend it. it had that profound of an effect on me. to those who read this comment. watch it. try to have as little distraction as possible. also,keep an open mind. this is not a film that can be viewed like a disney film or the movie of the week. instead, take the time to watch and actively listen to the dialog as well as read between the lines and get involved in the plot. you may find yourself in tears. not since "steel magnolias" have i been moved to tears by a film. this one did just that. thank you to the cast and writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion. it has been long overdue.
