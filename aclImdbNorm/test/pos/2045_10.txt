i'm a geena davis fan for life because of this movie. i've always loved samuel l jackson. and the two make a great pair on screen. this said, i think 'tlkg' is the best action movie i've ever seen, forget the twist endings that audiences have now come to expect and that filmmakers now try (mostly failing) to incorporate into their movies.<br /><br />10/10
