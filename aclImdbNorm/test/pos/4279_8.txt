fellowe's drama about a couple's marriage which is threatened by a younger third party which interests the wife of the house (watson). wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled husband who cant control his wife's cheating, and deals with the issue. i also like rupert everett a lot in his role as william bule, the man that watson has the affair with. although i think emily watson is a great actress, i had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written, did not make her too likable (i know a cheater is not supposed to be likable, but some of her actions and things she did had no reasoning behind them). the screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama, although fellowes' direction was good and the performances were also quite good. this film is better than unfaithful, but not a masterpiece by any means. ---imdb rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10
