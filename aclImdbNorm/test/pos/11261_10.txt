this movie is about three teens who have been best friends for the longest time, and go on the most messed up ride of their life. when heroine becomes the choice drug in their town, these three teens find themselves wrapped up in it all. this movie portrays heroine addiction very well, and is something you can't stop watching. mtv has never been the best at doing made for tv movies, but this one has to much good content to not watch it. i enjoyed this film, at the beginning i thought it would be the worst movie i've seen, but then as it went on it got better, and i couldn't turn away.
