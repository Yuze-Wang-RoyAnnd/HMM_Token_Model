if extreme activities (and i don't mean the hollywood ones like ufc & x-games) and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out.<br /><br />this is one of those truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tales of donald crowhurts's obsession to prove himself against great odds. those odds were stacked by mother nature, the media and his own mind. it is also about a time lost to us --although it was only 40 years ago.<br /><br />the filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him. <br /><br />i couldn't help but to think about timothy treadwell and the apollo astronauts in the 2 great docs grizzly man and in the shadow of the moon while experiencing --you don't simply "watch"-- this story.<br /><br />if you live in a big city buy it or rent it. it is worth the effort to find. i had to travel 100 miles to l.a. to buy it and i am glad i did.
