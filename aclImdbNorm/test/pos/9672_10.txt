family guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon.it is definitely the funniest tv show ever made and is better than the simpsons.i have never laughed so hard at a tv show in my life the things that make the show so funny is the plot,characters and themes that are dealt with in the show.there are very few themes that have not been dealt with on family guy.<br /><br />i have seen just about every episode of family guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons.my favorite characters are peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show.my second favorite character is stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a tv show.if you love family guiy you should check out american dad because it is just so similar and is created by seth mcfarlane.i hope this show never ends because it is a comic genius! 10/10
