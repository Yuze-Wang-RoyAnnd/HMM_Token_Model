i saw this movie on a fluke.i was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie.i gave it a chance not expecting much.the promotional movie posters i've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all.<br /><br />the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal.i'll leave it there.the movie is a heavy comedy and lot's of fun.if your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film.jack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician.<br /><br />tenacious d is definitely worth a look!
