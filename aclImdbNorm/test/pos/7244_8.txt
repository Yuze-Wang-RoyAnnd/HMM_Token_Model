as always joan hickson is wonderful as jane m. subtle, sharp and aware. i do not wish to dwell on her acting skills as they are praised enough on this site. i would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast seemed to be hand picked by director david tucker.<br /><br />liz fraser's performance as mrs. bent (the mother of the missing girl nora) is a joy to watch. subtle and deeply moving as the alcohol-depending grieving mother who loves and misses her daughter desperately. a good long shot of her monologue (thanks tucker!) so she can be enjoyed to the fullest. i was moved when i saw her the first time when it was broadcast and i am moved again, now i have it on dvd. brava.<br /><br />joanna hole as madge the tour-guide i find highly amusing. she is on the edge of over-acting but her role can have it. she is so funny as the over-organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on that bus, i find her hilarious. her reaction after she boarded every-one on the bus is great... as always: to perform comedy one has to take it very seriously, and that's what ms hole does.<br /><br />i do hope those two ladies have good careers (as i live in holland i do not know if they have, not all theater productions can be googled...) -their performances on the screen deserve it.<br /><br />pieter
