my friends and i saw this at the san diego black film festival. it was great. stormy is a strong black woman and nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /><br />rene is fine!!! seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. can someone forward me his contact info?<br /><br />my friend thinks flex is the finer of the two. she's been a flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased. the cousins were funny and just as trifling as nana described them. lol.<br /><br />i am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.
