this is my favorite horror film, a close 2nd to 'poltergeist'. i saw 'one dark night' when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where i worked.<br /><br />i was born in 1963, so i have a certain love for '80's horror films, despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written. what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of 'psychic vampirism' has not been addressed (at least, to my knowledge at that time) and is a very real phenomenon.<br /><br />i didn't care if adam west was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but thought meg tilly was good casting. the little-known donald hutton (from 'brainstorm' and 'invaders from mars') as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on ramar's abilities was sadly overlooked. as a gay guy, i was paying more attention to david mason daniels, meg tilly's unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend. he's selling real estate in texas now. <br /><br />i felt the film 'realistic' in two ways: raymar, who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment, had a funeral that was sparse in attendance, reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious, a hermit, but a killer. as you know, these types are buried without fanfare. second, if corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile, they would hover, dragging their feet. the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking, groaning, arms out-stretched zombies, but opted for what would be believable. kudos! the buzzing electrical discharge from ramar's eyes at his 'throne coffin' (like he's overseeing his kingdom of dead), cast an eerie magenta light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! if you've ever gone to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows. don't get me started on the cavernous silence. even ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric, perverted old man. the score was one-of-a-kind and memorable, and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out. the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be. i especially liked the carefully-planned characteristics of each corpse: the bride, the badly decomposed child still holding its teddy bear, the grandmother, the tall thin black guy, and the half-faced world war ii vet, and the green-slimed eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the 'sisters' clique initiators. even corpses can be good actors, i suppose. the only thing i had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke julie's boyfriend couldn't possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on it's stomach and feet first, but why? it looked a little to fresh too.<br /><br />the film begins eerie, with us never seeing ramar's face (until the last quarter of the film, which is like unwrapping a birthday present) as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughter's psychic flash. we then see coroners hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see he's experimented his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes into his wall. the rest does drag as the heathers-like 'sisters' group baits julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed build up to the unleashing horror later. the movie isn't bloody in any sense of the word. the goriest part is when ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him, and he bubbles then melts. i've always felt that a power like ramar's could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into. i can see it now: one dark night ii: turning in the grave. but let's face it-the film stands alone. i heard the film had other titles, but the original fits.<br /><br />a remake would be pointless. but if there were to be one, i would write better dialog, and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on ramar's abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. in this information age, something like that would be well documented on dvd. and more corpses! why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when ramar's power could spread to the graveyard too? let's just say i'd hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that too can be shown. i think having one of the initiating sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character. with cg effects, some awesome scenes with ramar animating cremated remains would be off the wall! <br /><br />say what you will about,'one dark night' but it has it all. so see at least once in your life...or death!
