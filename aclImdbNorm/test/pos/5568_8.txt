when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape, i had no idea what to expect. i was immensely impressed and satisfied with "premiere". subsequent re-watches, however, have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially. "premiere" is not a great farscape episode, but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters.<br /><br />the episode begins with john crichton (ben browder), an astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch into space in the farscape module, a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk. crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, jack crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. of course, everything goes wrong and crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and winds up in "a distant part of the galaxy".<br /><br />after exiting the wormhole, crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship. from here, the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner.<br /><br />the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode. of course, there is crichton, played well by ben browder. he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with. he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything. in "premiere", crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers. he knows nothing at all about either side, but in helping aeryn (a captured peacekeeper pilot) it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers. he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for crais, a peacekeeper captain, declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother. this puts crichton in an interesting situation: he's stuck with bizarre, violent escaped prisoners in a far-off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all. crichton's total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscape's first season.<br /><br />the supporting cast is just as compelling. there's zhaan, a blue delvian and former prisoner. she's peaceful and reasonable, as opposed to fellow prisoner ka d'argo, a powerful and hard-headed warrior. virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup, allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing. d'argo's mega-makeup, in contrast, is below-par. he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose, and there is something peculiar about his eyes. they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup. farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1, but the overall costume would, for me at least, remain as a problem until season 2.<br /><br />the puppet/digital characters of rygel and pilot are, to put it simply, excellent. rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft. in "premiere" he is given some good dialogue but not much else. pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship, moya, and moya's passengers. even in the first episode, pilot gives off the appearance of being a real, living alien; he never once in the show seems to be a giant, expensive machine.<br /><br />the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well. the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans, who look just like humans. the chief antagonist is introduced in "premiere" as captian crais, who believes that crichton killed his brother. in reality, crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship. aeryn sun, a pilot who crichton helps escape, tries to explain that the death was an accident, but crais just claims that she is "irreversiby contaminated" and refused to change his mind. crais obsession for revenge, warranted or not (it should be clear to crais that crichton isn't responsible), is mysterious in "premiere", but would be explained later in the season. aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character. by being forced to leave the peacekeepers, she changes her whole way of life, and is in that regard in a similar (though less severe) situation as crichton.<br /><br />the actual episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat rushed and clunky. so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything. also, d'argo (for now) looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing. still, "premiere" is solid entertainment. the special effects (such as in the starburst sequences) are impressive. most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original. despite its flaws, "premiere" is a must-see for farscape fans. 3/4
