hari om is about an impossible love between a french tourist and the auto-rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a rendezvous with her indifferent boyfriend. a sort of third-world road movie, that careens from lush reverie to madcap comedy, it is distinguished by the stellar performance of vijay raaz, who has become one of india's busier actors after his appearance as the event planner in mira nair's monsoon wedding.<br /><br />in an interview, raaz proves to be quite untouched by his success, responding rather carefully and pensively to questions. he discovered a love of acting and joined a major theatre troupe while in university, but for one with so much formal training is surprisingly inarticulate about his craft. he speaks of honesty and purity as the wellsprings of his approach, and the earnestness of his desire to communicate something authentic to the audience is clear. on screen, raaz conveys an emotional integrity and dramatic assurance that lifts his characterization to an extraordinary level, and director bharatbala has cast and directed him perfectly. he has a wonderfully expressive face which the camera revels in; close-ups of that face are as compelling as shots of camille natta, who is gorgeous as the frenchwoman isa.
