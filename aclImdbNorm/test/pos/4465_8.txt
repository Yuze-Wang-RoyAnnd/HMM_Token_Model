sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a looney tunes featurette than a grisly giallo, "don't torture a duckling" (1972) is nonetheless a grade a thriller from horror maestro lucio fulci. in this one, someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural, southern italian village and, typical for these gialli, there are many suspects. there's barbara bouchet (patrizia), looking more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen her, a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal; florinda bolkan (martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft-practicing beau; giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweet-faced priest; his dour mother; and on and on. the film features some unusually violent set pieces, including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard (one of the most realistically bloody sequences that i've ever seen) and a nifty dukeout when the killer is ultimately revealed. the film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of. still, this giallo fascinates, with its unusual rural backdrop, unsettling child murders, oddball characters, and freaky score by riz ortolani. the film has been beautifully photographed in what i presume to be monte sant'angelo, near the adriatic in southern italy (at least, that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits). and while subtitling would've made this fine-looking dvd work even better (the american slang doesn't convince in this rural italian setting), anchor bay is to be thanked for another job well done. oh...that title does eventually make perfect sense, too!
