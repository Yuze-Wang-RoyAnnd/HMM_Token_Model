i recalled watching this program as a young boy in australia in the 60s, and enjoyed it on dvd again as a 50-year-old father of young kids. although the bad guys are mostly shallow characters and there is a component of violence, i am very happy to have my 6- and 8-year old kids watch this because the central characters are deep, kind and honourable, the japanese culture shines through, the violence is not gory, nobody glories in it, and the program is beautiful to watch. it does not promote nightmares, but instead it shows much of the culture that must have primarily influenced the design of jedi knights in star wars. <br /><br />the quality of the dvds does leave something to be desired. video perfectionists will not like this one. it is strongly reminiscent of something held on 16mm film and projected onto the wall in some basement... which it may well be. the soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we have come to expect from home theatre. however, my kids noticed only that it was not in colour, and i suspect they only noticed that because we had been talking recently about how old things are often like that. the beauty of mt fuji is evident even in b&w. something about the 17th-century setting makes the quality part of the atmosphere, as if you peer into the past through some time window.<br /><br />overall this program is better than most things on the air, and a far better advertisement for japanese tv than pokemon, but you may consider it of marginal value if you did not have the experience of seeing it back in the 60s. my score of 8/10 takes its age into account.
