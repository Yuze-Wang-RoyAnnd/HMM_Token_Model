chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator adenoid hynkel, (i.e hitler) a movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies..it was banned in germany by hitler and was a risk in a way for chaplin because if the war was lost, he surely wouldve been sent away to be "reeducated"<br /><br />a funny satire with the classic scene of hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preachy in the end. this was the last movie with chaplin's trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9
