certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. there isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- myronex "putney, there's trouble in the black room!" "my name is rufus." the lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling slapshot, caddyshack, anchorman, repoman, dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. "putney, myronex called you tasteless!" "my organization is pro-integration..." "where's lopez? 'he's in my head'" they don't sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ...this movie will eat your brain, it's too good. i've read reviews calling this film racist, which couldn't be farther from the truth. every scene is gold, from the etherial cereal commercial to the brothers in the black room meeting to that haunting trumpet in the closing scene. one word - genius.
