this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it, so if you're not a fan of dry humor, dark humor, or back-handed humor, you probably could find something else to do. if you are, however, this is quirky, with some nice twists and a flowing, natural dialog.<br /><br />the story itself is quite engaging, not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes, but close. i mean that in the best way possible. the intrigues are plenty, the twists are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters are downright lovable.<br /><br />i had a great time with this movie.<br /><br />it rates an 8.3/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
