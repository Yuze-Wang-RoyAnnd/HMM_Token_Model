i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember, but never forgot the performance of sammy davis, jr. i just by chance thought to look for it on video. this rendition of porgy and bess is a treasure. i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well. i just can't imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances sammy davis, jr. every gave. whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his/her ignorance. i will continue to look for it though. maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many african american actors.
