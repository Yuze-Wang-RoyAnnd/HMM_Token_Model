in the history of cinema, every great film-maker had to create a first film. many times when viewed after they have become a success, a light bulb goes on in our heads. the connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started. so it is with horses on mars. it is the subtle humor woven around a seemingly straight-forward narrative that tells a great story, but allows you to enjoy the visuals at the same time. in the imagery, i found great attention to detail and a production polish that is rare in any student film.<br /><br />a young film-maker always has improvements to be made. but if mr. anderson continues on this path, i think we will someday look back on this film as the beginning a great career.<br /><br />you should definitely view this film. nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.
