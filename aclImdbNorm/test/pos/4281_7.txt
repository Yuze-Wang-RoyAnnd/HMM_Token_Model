i really liked this movie.<br /><br />everyone has something to be blamed for, everyone is real. no paperboard heroes or cold, omnipotent, know-all characters.<br /><br />i read many others viewers here complaining about anne morality and about james will to maintain his love for her, despite her cheating on him, but i don't agree.<br /><br />i found anne (emily watson) absolutely wonderful and i felt love for her.<br /><br />she was a heavily repressed woman, her actions were not planned: once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors. but so it's in real life, when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors (expecially at the start point).<br /><br />was she a little too ungrateful? maybe. but we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time. she knows that james after all is a good man, maybe a little too stiff, serious and work centered; but she also feels the urge to live the life as herself.<br /><br />is she to blame more than him? i think no.<br /><br />but the turn happening into their lives generates some changes.<br /><br />james instead of letting his wife go out of his life (as other viewers suggested as the right choice) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for the better. he starts to understand that what he superficially though was ok (his marriage) in reality was a control game played by him on his wife.<br /><br />this is not a story with characters having over-emotional and precarious nature (i.e. the usual clich`e latin american or italian jealous guys), this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brain.<br /><br />it can be very painful but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you are likely to forgive his/her cheating and let him/her go. unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, crime-of-passion inclined, possessive and mentally instable individual.<br /><br />a really good movie. the last scene, when james - despite all the things happened before - goes with anne to the train station is really moving: she is free and he understood what freedom means for a person.<br /><br />guido
