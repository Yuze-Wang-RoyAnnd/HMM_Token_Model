before i saw this film i didn't really expect to much from it, although my friend advised otherwise. due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film. the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away. from the credits i was falling of my seat; i just couldn't contain myself. the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy. hynkel is the absolute double for the jewish barber, who comes back from fighting in the war. due to the heroics of the barber, he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle which the jews had. but things went wrong and stolz was arrested, but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish surburb, 'the ghetto'. due to this escape, the german army began searching which meant that the barber and stolz got arrested but again they escaped, only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion. *****the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic, it complies the morals which society could only dream about. in the speech it contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the seriouness and sincerenity which it entailed, and it definately works, because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives, looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest, most prominent things such as war.
