this is one of the best non-english series i have seen. it weaves interesting single and double episodes of crime-solving together with a personal aspect that you just don't get in csi. the individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day job and occasionally interfere. additionally the characters all manage to naturally evolve throughout the episodes.<br /><br />the casting is superb and it was taped all over denmark, giving a good example of the highlights that majestic country has to offer. unfortunately only 32 episodes were made, however they are top-notch television. here's hoping they consider making some more episodes of the same caliber.
