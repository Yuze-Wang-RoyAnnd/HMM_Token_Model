wow, what a strange film. it's a david lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird. <br /><br />i defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. i can't be done. after some research following my second viewing of this film, i pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. so, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. let me just say the key to the film is naomi watts' character.<br /><br />at any rate, i find the film fascinating. i love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. the camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la lynch's "blue velvet." there also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. in all, it's very well scored.<br /><br />like lynch's "twin peaks" television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out tv series. when that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. that may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.<br /><br />the theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.<br /><br />both watts and the other leading lady, laura eleana harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.<br /><br />i enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. it's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very intriguing movie.....just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.
