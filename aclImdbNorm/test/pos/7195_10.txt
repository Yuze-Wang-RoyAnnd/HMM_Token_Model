it is the first time i can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book... in fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed!<br /><br />such as the egyptian slave cellularis who had difficulty transmitting, um, communicating, lol! or when tidivinnus was played like a quasi-sith lord and got annoyed when the roman empire endured a blow, the general ordered for the empire to..? ah, watch the movie folks!<br /><br />i can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in french cinema history and for my part it was worth it, depardieux was excellent as the roman bashing and boar chomping obelix. clavier playing the little indomitable gaul was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of jean reno in "just visiting."<br /><br />the fight-scene between artifis and edifis was hilarious and was nice to see the matrix theme was not borrowed to despoil an otherwise perfect battle!<br /><br />redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture, from scuttling their own ship to being the engine for otis' (edifis' assistant) invention used at the very end.<br /><br />i understand there's asterix and the olympics with many of the same team back, by toutatis, i plan to view that too!
