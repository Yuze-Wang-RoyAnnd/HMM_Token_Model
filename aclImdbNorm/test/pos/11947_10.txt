"one crazy summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best), movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />just when one crazy scene is done, another emerges. it never lets you rest. just one thing after another. the soundtrack is great. the songs are the right ones for the scenes.<br /><br />it is also a clean movie. little that is dirty in it.<br /><br />of course, it has the story of the guys you wouldn't trust with your lunch money, taking up a challenge, and winning over people with more resources. who'd want to see it if they failed? there is a serious side, in that parents and children do not live up to each others' dreams. one should always have an open mind, and weigh all the options. this applies both to parents and children. in "one crazy summer", the parents are wrong. this is not always the case.
