a fantastic movie, and very overlooked. gary has never been more handsome, and ingrid is more beautiful than in any other film. if you don't believe, just watch the movie. every cast member is wonderful; the love scenes between gary and ingrid will make your pulse race! the story is great, the script is oscar caliber. don't miss this film!!
