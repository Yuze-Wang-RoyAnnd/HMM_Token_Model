i think that the movie was really good. subject, acting and nusrat fateh ali khan's music were marvellous. although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.
