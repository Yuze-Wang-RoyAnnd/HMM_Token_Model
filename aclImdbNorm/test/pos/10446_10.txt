"the last american virgin", along with "fast times at ridgemont high" is one the last great teen films ever made. it is tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties. much-maligned by critics that it was a sophomoric, banal attempt to recreate the magic of "fast times at ridgemont high", these same critics fail to recognize that the two films were actually filmed concurrently during late 1981, and released at only slight intervals from one another. either way, the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues many male teenagers are confronted with as they reach their sexual maturity. especially considering the heart-wrenching discovery the protagonist, gary is confronted with in the end. american pie this is not. the story revolves around a trio of male teenagers, and their mostly unsuccessful sexual pursuits. gary is the least successful of the group, hence the tagline last american virgin. secretly, gary lusts after karen, who is involved with rick, his best friend. rick and karen begin having sex, and karen gets pregnant, only to be dumped by rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility which lies before him. gary glides into help karen, which leads to the aforementioned, unexpected conclusion. overall as a film, i find it was very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and a remarkable coming of age tale dealing with issues such as envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are just as pertinent today as they were over twenty years ago. also, it has one of the rockingest soundtracks ever made!!!
