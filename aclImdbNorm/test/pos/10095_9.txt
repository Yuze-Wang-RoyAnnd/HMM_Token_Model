three words: piece of art. this film is just great. it's beautiful, sad, frightening and thought-provoking at the same time. the score constantly stays in my head, the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />it was more by chance than on purpose that i saw this movie. at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films, which maybe good. well, i saw the title "a tale of two sisters" which sounded very interesting. then i read the summary of the plot and decided "you don't just watch this film, you've gotta buy it". said, done. i bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute.<br /><br />the plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end; the twist near the end of the film made me scream. i really didn't see something like this coming. and the ending scene made me cry...it just made me cry. it was so sad.<br /><br />well, i recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot, with scary scenes and atmosphere. although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is, as i mentioned before, a very sad one. but this just fits in the mood of the film, doesn't it?
