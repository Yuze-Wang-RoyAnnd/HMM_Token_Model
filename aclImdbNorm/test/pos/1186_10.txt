it couldn't have come out at a worse time--just as the nation was entering the reagan years, the boom-boom 80s, the time of no regrets, no concerns. it got no word of mouth, and opened poorly. the studio ditched it. but hair is possibly the best musical ever made--with forman directing and tharpe choreographing, it's a startlingly beautiful, well-acted, well-written triumph that few people remember. the casting is perfect, the musical numbers unforgettable, and even the downer of an ending doesn't diminish the film's indomitable spirit.<br /><br />if you haven't see this movie, you haven't seen the best musical of all time. seriously.
