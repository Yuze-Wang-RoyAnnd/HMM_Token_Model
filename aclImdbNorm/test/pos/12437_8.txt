a bumbling error at the ministry of education results in nutbourne boys school having to share with st swithin's school for girls. this bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on, however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble.<br /><br />the happiest days of your life is based on the john dighton play from 1948, with dighton writing the part of headmistress whitchurch specifically for margaret rutherford. replacing george howe from the play in the role of headmaster pond, is alastair sim, and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation, sim & rutherford are perfectly wonderful, bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie, highly entertaining. directed by the gifted frank launder, and produced by the equally adroit sidney gilliat, the happiest days of your life is a quintessentially british movie, obviously a precursor to the st trinians franchise, the film entertains the children with it's high jinks clash of the sexes heart, whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent. thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as nutbourne rail station, great fun 8/10.
