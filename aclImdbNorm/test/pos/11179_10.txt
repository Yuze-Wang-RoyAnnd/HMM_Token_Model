this was my second experience of the monkey island series, the full seven years after i had been shown the first game. what was my response? "oh, great, we're playing a cartoon." i'm glad my brother shut me up then and played on, because the jokes caught my attention once again, as well as armato's wonderful voice-acting of guybrush - not to mention everyone else done well (i still think cmi's elaine sounds better than emi's). the cutscenes do well to illustrate something happening, and the art of both the game and cutscenes are excellent. when we found the cd with the originals, secret and lechuck's revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through revenge - one such moment was where we just sat down and blew half a day on it. however, cmi has to be the monkey island game i've played the most, especially for the return of swordfighting and combat on the high seas. that moment when you encounter kenny and he tells you he's gone straight and then, "i'm running guns!" had both my brother and i in tears from laughter. and that's not the best part of the game, not by far.
