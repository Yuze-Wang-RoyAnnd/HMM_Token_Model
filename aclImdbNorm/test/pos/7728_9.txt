there are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. this is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book or other carmen movies seen before. it just stands for itself and i must say that this carmen does it very well. it is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. vicente aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. let's take it as it is.<br /><br />and that brings us to the next misunderstanding. someone complains about the typical spanish clich'es in the movie. well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. it is not only an accurate portrait of the "black spain" of knife and espadrille that goya portrayed so vividly, but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. honestly, anyone who doesn't want to see any clich'e about spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see carmen, but in this case those clich'es are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices.<br /><br />another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. it is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. if all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. paz vega has an immaculate diction with her andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. her argentinian partner, leonardo sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the basque officer that became a "bandolero", and her accent is very well learned.<br /><br />no less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. to say that paz vega is "horrible" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. we already had in spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. and that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the ones that hadn't detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for. i'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got. paz vega is carmen, and an excellent one, in vicente aranda's movie.
