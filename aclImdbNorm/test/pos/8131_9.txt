this is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted film. it is funny and sometimes hilarious. the finale is a bit disappointing, since it tries to wrap everything up into too neat a package. the film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the jane austen staging, the camping trip as examples. b & h does not attempt to mirror the predominant attitudes toward homosexuality and bisexuality. most of the characters are quite accepting of sexual diversity. in that sense it is a joyous vacation from homophobic society. and it is a celebration of a flexibility, a loosening of rigid sexual categories--perhaps a happy harbinger of things to come.
