i just watched this film at an advanced screening. i had not read the book, and knew nothing of the story, but went because the book was voted "book of the year" by two local colleges. so i cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done.<br /><br />in short, i thought this was an incredibly moving story. the acting was believable, and the insight into afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking. my oldest friend is iranian-american, and so i felt an affinity for certain middle eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie, as they reminded me of the times i spent with his family.<br /><br />the themes of friendship, family, human values, and courage under fire are universal, and are well developed in the film. i won't list the plot details, as these can be obtained elsewhere. but based on the film's technical aspects, the acting, and, above all, its heart-wrenching story, i would definitely recommend this movie.
