i didn't know a lot about this film going into it but i did find out that kane was a wrestler, which didn't exactly thrill me but hey, i liked "santa's slay" and that had a wrestler in it, so what the hell. the story begins very strangely and promisingly but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick, although the settings helped some. a bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump, to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter. the driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie wherein he encounters this big galoot that had just killed his partner and blinded another woman. the teens, all being punk smart-asses, all of course object to having to do any real work, but they're part of some unique co-ed work program, yep, what a great idea that is, of course. little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax payers of that state some money. of course, it's the guy that likes to collect eyeballs, and he's got quite a collection going. there won't be a lot here that horror fans haven't seen before but there's a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hard-core fan. the setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too, and there's little sub-stories, like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes, since this co-ed work crew is evenly matched. most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well. not great but far better than silent hill or when a stranger calls, and perhaps better than some of the other crap that i wouldn't bother to see. 7 out of 10.
