there's not much anyone can say about this flick....the plot is quite simple: two police officers (who also happen to be lovers) are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal, with the help of the "lady of the house", played by hardcore pornstar chloe. as anyone can guess, there's a few plot twists and some blurred alliances, but the writing was just horrible, even for a softcore movie.<br /><br />i've read some previous posts about nicole hilbig's accent (she plays the female cop). yes, it's hard to understand what she's saying at times, but i think i've placed it. i did some sniffing around....i think she's from germany, hence her odd-sounding accent. she makes an impression even without speaking, however...she's got a great looking body.<br /><br />there were a couple of "from behind" sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore film....excellent work there. the three-way scene toward the end wasn't bad either.<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />i kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a part-time call girl at the end. she enjoyed her three-way way too much.<br /><br />*end spoiler*<br /><br />i'm not gonna nitpick about the story too much, seeing as this is a low-budget, direct-to-video softcore flick. however, it just seems like i've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline.<br /><br />women: b (chloe and hilbig were okay as the eye-candy) sex: b+ (scenes were kinda short, but good) story: c (a recycled plot, but whatever works, eh?) overall: b-
