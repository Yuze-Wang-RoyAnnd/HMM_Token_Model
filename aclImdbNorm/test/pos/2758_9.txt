tony hawk's pro skater 2x, isn't much different at all from the previous games (excluding tony hawk 3). the only thing new that is featured in tony hawk's pro skater 2x, is the new selection of levels, and tweaked out graphics. tony hawk's pro skater 2x offers a new career mode, and that is the 2x career. the 2x career is basically tony hawk 1 career, because there is only about five challenges per level. if you missed tony hawk 1 and 2, i suggest that you buy tony hawk's pro skater 2x, but if you have played the first two games, you should still try this one. overall, there really isn't anything new, but it is still very fun to go through the game. hopefully this review benefits your needs.<br /><br />graphics: 7 out of 10 overall, the clean visuals isn't really one of tony hawk's pro skater 2x's main characteristics. the atmosphere has been changed around a lot from tony hawk 1 and 2, and the character models look a little bit improved. when you look back to tony hawk's pro skater 1 and 2 on the old ps1, the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head. in tony hawk's pro skater 2x, the graphics are rendered a lot better. the character models are no longer filled with jaggys, the textures are more smooth, but not to the farthest extent. tony hawk's pro skater 2x's visuals do not compare to tony hawk 3's graphics, but activision probably didn't want to make tony hawk's pro skater 2x have extraordinary graphics. overall, the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put the full power of the xbox to use in here. graphics are nice, and clean, that's all i have to say.<br /><br />sound: 8 out of 10 the sound effects don't deliver much to the imagination, but the skateboards popping off of the ground sound great. the main reason why i gave the sound factor a rating, was because you are not obligated to listen to the below average tony hawk soundtrack, because there is a custom soundtrack feature. the sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in tony hawk 1 and 2, mainly because it is more clearer, and just the fact that everything sounds great. one of the main reasons why i bought this game, is because of the custom soundtrack. the grind sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did, just a little tweaked out. one of the major problems of the sound factor, is the fact that if the song is over, it will not proceed to the next track, the song that you have just listened to will just play over again. i don't like the in-game soundtrack, but like i said, you are not obligated to listen to it.<br /><br />controls: 10 out of 10 the controls are the best part of tony hawk's pro skater 2x. the control set-up is marvelously comfortable, and easy to get used to. back in the playstation days, people thought that the controls were the best ever, but it looks like 2x has done a better job with the xbox control. surprisingly, it is very easy to use the control stick to execute tricks. activision has done great work with tony hawk's pro skater 2x's controls. they have made the xbox controller the best for tony hawk games. you will not be disappointed with the control style, and that is a guarantee.<br /><br />game play: 10 out of 10 excluding the fact that tony hawk's pro skater 2x is basically tony hawk 1 and 2 put together, the game play is still unbelievably fun. the game play factor has been changed around a bit. this time, you get a lot more air than in the first two games, and it is a lot easier to perform tricks. in tony hawk's pro skater 2x, each character has three career modes, consisting of tony hawk 1 career, tony hawk 2 career, and the 2x career. tony hawk 1 career is rather easy because in the first game, you get nothing for air. the tony hawk 2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation version did. the only amount of difficulty that applies to the 2x career, is finding out where all items are, but after you've done that, 2x career is no hard at all. in the 2x career, there is a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes, collecting s-k-a-t-e, and doing whatever else is required for that particular level. the third level out of the three, is the competition level, where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold. in the first two levels, the secret tapes, and collecting the letters s-k-a-t-e, are featured in both of them. overall, tony hawk's pro skater 2x still maintains the old tony hawk's pro skater vibe.<br /><br />story: -<br /><br />fun factor: 10 out of 10 tony hawk's pro skater 2x is by far, the most funnest game on xbox today. i have played tony hawk's pro skater 1 and 2, and back then, i didn't like them, but for some reason, tony hawk's pro skater 2x is really fun. there really isn't much to say, except that tony hawk's pro skater 2x is by far, the best game on xbox today. one problem, is that if you've already gone through the game once, you will play it a couple more times, but it will be repetitive.<br /><br />replay value: 10 out of 10 tony hawk's pro skater 2x delivers a high amount of replay value. there is a lot of cheats to unlock, and a lot of character videos. overall, tony hawk's pro skater 2x has lots of replay value, mainly because it is so fun.<br /><br />best feature: you are not obligated to listen to the crappy in-game soundtrack. worst feature: the custom soundtrack is a bit messed up.<br /><br />final statement: lots of people have complained in the past that they didn't like tony hawk's pro skater 2x because there is nothing new, but they should stop complaining because your getting a lot of game for $50.00.<br /><br />graphics: 7 out of 10. sound: 8 out of 10.
