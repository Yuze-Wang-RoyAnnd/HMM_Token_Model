the movie is excellent. acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. it seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring ronald coleman. that movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. from talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, i believe the impact was something akin to the first "starwars" movie in modern times. i have seen it. it was and is wonderful. but that does not mean that this version is not also worthy. from the first scene the 1973 version grabs you. the noise and tumult are fantastic, especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of shangri la. and burt bacharach's music is beautiful. so - by all means enjoy the 1937 version. but do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 king kong destroy peter jackson's of this year.
