i really liked this film - not so much for the story (which was okay, but was a bit slow-moving in spots) but moreso for the incredibly beautiful scenery of greece and the greek isles! susan sarandon is utterly engaging as the carefree love interest of john cassavetes - a man "on the edge". but the scenery! oh oh oh!
