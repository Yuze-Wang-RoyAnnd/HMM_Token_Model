i love so much about this movie: the music, the cinematography, the acting, the story, and all the mormon clich'es. just because they are clich'es doesn't mean they aren't true! this is not perfect, it is a movie after all. though excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs, it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark, cold scene they did in this film. i also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. i thought that was so cool. i mean, i believe that angels do watch over us. what is one supposed to do while waiting? smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting. i loved the irony cause mormons make such a deal about smoking. i saw this movie 7 times in theaters in salt lake, and cried every time! it blows me away. and i've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. i would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen. i hope the tower theatre in salt lake will bring it back regularly at general conference time, as a cult movie (pun intended, but no offense intended).
