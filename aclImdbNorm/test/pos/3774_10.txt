i loved this movie. mark blankfield was perfect for this role. more classic sci/fie/horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. a no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. can we expect more? let's hope so. i would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. mel brookes made some remakes of classic films.he made some very strong contributions. a picture of dorian gray would be a good suggestion. i hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. we are needing a good insurgence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. a good comedy fix.
