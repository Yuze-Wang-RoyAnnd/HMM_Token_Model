when i first saw this movie,i also expected "our boys" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the tv show. i didn't "get it" back then. but,years later,at a party years later,at a 70s' type par-tay,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,"head" was on late at night.we watched it,and finally realized what "head" was all about. it spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,"a manufactured image". as davy jones wrote in his autobio,"they made a monkey out of me",he openly admits that everyone in the film,had been up all night smoking weed.they made fun of themselves,society,everything! great film! tho,as a 52 yr old granny,i no longer "induldge", i still watch this film when i want a good lol!!!
