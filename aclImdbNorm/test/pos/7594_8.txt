there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it is a tad predictable. drew barrymore does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film - excellent casting choice. what i found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her - in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that, and knowing how awful drew's character was (ostrich feathers?) at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away, regardless of what rumors her brother drums up. (and does "kole slaw food" really make him all that popular? i doubt it). as for rooting for drew's character to win big as a reporter - well, i would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom. a bit contrived. having said all that, it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much.
