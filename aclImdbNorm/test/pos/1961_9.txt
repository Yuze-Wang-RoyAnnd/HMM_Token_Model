river's edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history. there were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones i've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. the film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. the film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters. the film begins with a murder. we then follow the murderer, nicknamed john, as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done. rather than give the expected reaction, most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from layne; who makes it his number one priority to help john clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it. the other friends mull over the crime, and before long one of them goes to the police...<br /><br />river's edge features a host of great performances from its young cast. keanu reeves has a reputation for wooden acting, and for good reason; but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best. crispin glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane layne. glover always stands out in every film he's in, and while he does go over the top a little bit; he convinces well as the lead in this movie. reeves and glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes daniel roebuck and joshua john miller, as well as the great dennis hopper in another wild role. the film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone. the central characters are all of the 'slacker/stoner' generation and the way that they genuinely don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined. the film is also rather funny, owing to some of the characters' lines; but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy. overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing!
