if you want to see a film starring stan laurel from the laurel & hardy comedies, this is not the film for you. stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of those films for another two years. if, however, you want a good travesty of the rudolph valentino blood and sand, which had been made the previous year, this is the movie for you. all the stops are pulled out, both in physical comedy and on the title cards and if the movie is not held together by character, the plot of valentino's movie is used -- well sort of.
