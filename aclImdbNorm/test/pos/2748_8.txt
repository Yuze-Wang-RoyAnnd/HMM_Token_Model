william wellmann, who directed one of the most exciting silent films ever made, 'wings' (1927), here returns to the skies with another rip-roaring story of dare-devil fliers. wellmann had been an air ace in world war one, and no one knew biplanes like he did. here they are, stunt-flying, crashing, exploding in the air, and everything you can think of, plus a fascinating glimpse of commercial air operations in 1932 as well. and there is a good strong story, excellently played by the sombre richard barthelmess (the silent star who made several films with d. w. griffith), sally eilers and tom brown. eilers is a real sizzler. such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of those photofit botoxed dummies who play in movies in today's hollywood and all look identical. the story is a sad one, played with genuine pathos, and well directed. towards the end of the film there are some extraordinarily thrilling scenes of danger and rescue, and what must be the most ingenious blind landing in thick fog ever thought of. i dare not give away the ingenious aspects of that particular episode. the character played by barthelmess is very like wellmann himself, a truly wild hell-raiser in the air. anyone who likes early aviation would love this film, and it's very rewarding for anyone who likes good solid entertainment, love, tears, and non-stop action all combined in a kind of delectable wellmann omelette.
