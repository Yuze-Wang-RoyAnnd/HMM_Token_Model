i just saw "everything is illuminated" at the telluride film festival. this is a truly remarkable film. very emotional, funny at times and heart-warming. bring your handkerchiefs! for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes, i'm reminded of the endings of "babette's feast" and "the notebook." the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just as this film did.<br /><br />no spoilers here. the summary is, as imdb describes, a young man's journey to the ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up.<br /><br />the dialog is in english and ukrainian (and russian too, i believe). this allows for some wonderfully linguistically-based moments as one character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the english speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances.<br /><br />the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences. be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune.<br /><br />this is lieve schreiber's directorial debut and is well done. i give this film a 9, one of the best films i've seen in a long time. i recommend it highly.
