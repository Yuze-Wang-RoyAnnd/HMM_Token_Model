this is how i interpreted the movie: first things first. there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (taylor) torturing or nailing ben's hands to the wall. however the same cannot be told of the gals. in the end too, u see taylor disappear as he walks. looks like the message there was "there was no taylor". and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben. also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben. it was taylor all the time. but in real, taylor was ben. if they were two different people, then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times? but of course before that, u do see both of them together and that cud just be ben's imagination at work. also, when ben was out of jail, the text on screen clearly says that ben's story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained (read mine, cars etc...)even after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben, she doesn't find him. why??? because ben (taylor) was out looking for the gals. instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylor's (ben) web cam, photos etc...<br /><br />somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz, both of them knew that taylor was ben. so, my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination. otherwise if there really was a taylor, then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben.
