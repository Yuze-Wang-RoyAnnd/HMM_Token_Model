it's not really about wine. no, nossiter's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. to this end he has made an excellent, objective film. spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media-finessed, anodynesprech amercians and auld-europeans: the art of wine-making against market-driven, laboratorised product manufacture. it's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.<br /><br />nossiter's film is occasionally infuriating to watch - cameras are neither concealed, nor steadicam, by any means. there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through, often too short a time on screen.<br /><br />however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can't play anyway. the characters speak for - and therefore condemn - themselves. well worth a viewing 7/10
