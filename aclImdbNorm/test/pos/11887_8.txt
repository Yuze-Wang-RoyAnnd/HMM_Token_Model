this is one of the great modern kung fu films. a lot of the reviews seem to miss the point that the comedy is based on a quite subtle at times (at other times right in your face) contrast between old and new china. kara hui for instance is called a country bumpkin and gets into trouble whenever she tries to adapt to the new but in the end to save her families honour dresses as an old fashioned heroine in contrast to the modern military style of hsiao ho. gordon liu seems to have played his part for laughs playing off his serious, monk persona with silly wigs and a guitar. the end fight is simply fantastic and ends in a defeat for johnny wang rather than death. kwan yung moon should be mentioned for his great playing of a thug with 'invincible armour' - simply terrific. and kara hui does some magnificent acting and fighting. a great film.
