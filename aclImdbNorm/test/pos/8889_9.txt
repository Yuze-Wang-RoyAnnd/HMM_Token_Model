if you had a mother that described you like that, you just might be looking to bump her off yourself. it's how danny devito feels about anne ramsey, it's just how to put the plan in action.<br /><br />and his creative writing class taught by professor billy crystal gives him the idea. that and a viewing of alfred hitchcock's classic strangers on a train which gives devito the idea to switch murders with crystal who hates his wife, kate mulgrew, who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write, but is also carrying on with hunky tony ciccone.<br /><br />throw momma from the train plays out kind of like strangers on a train as devito seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme. but crystal's having a bit of a problem putting ramsey down even with danny's help. that woman might need killing, but she's going to take a lot of it.<br /><br />the only academy recognition that throw momma from the train got was an academy award nomination for anne ramsey for best supporting actress. ramsey lost to olympia dukakis for moonstruck, but the film turned out to be her finest hour. ramsey already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year, but look at the list of credits she managed to amass even after throw momma from the train, she worked right up to the end.<br /><br />i've seen interviews with both of the stars of throw momma from the train, billy crystal and danny devito, and both have gladly conceded that anne ramsey's performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them. their acknowledgment of ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute.<br /><br />if marion lorne in strangers on a train had been anything like anne ramsey here, farley granger would gladly have joined robert walker in disposing of her. throw momma from a train is one of the best black comedies out there, should not be missed.
