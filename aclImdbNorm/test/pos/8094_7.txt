written, produced and directed by charlie chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-nazi propaganda piece, skewering adolf hitler.<br /><br />chaplin plays adenoid hynckel, the dictator of tomania, as well as a jewish barber who is hynckel's spitting image. his parody of hitler is brilliant. anyone who has ever seen newsreels of hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. <br /><br />i thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical chaplin slap-stick focussing on the first world war adventures of the jewish barber. having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so i was wondering what all the fuss was about. but the movie picks up steam quickly. there are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-jewish nature of "hynckel-ism" to make the propaganda point. the climax of the film is a brilliant anti-nazi speech given by chaplin at the end of the movie.<br /><br />as good as chaplin is in this movie, though, i thought the whole thing was stolen by jack oakie, playing the dictator of "bacteria" - "benzino napaloni." our first look at oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. the scenes in which hynckel and napaloni negotiate over the fate of "osterlich" had me in stitches.<br /><br />this was a very good movie, and well worth watching.
