i love this movie because every single element of it is nothing less than excellent. i will quickly praise a few of them. peter o'toole gives us one of his great performances as he becomes the definitive mr. chips. petula clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as katharine. the director was able to bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way. combine that with the fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you have a film that shows the fine quality of its production. i can't praise the well-planned camera work enough, it moves us up and around, zooming in and out, giving us the best views of, and letting the locations become part of the scene. petula clark's last song 'you and i' is just 3 beautifully composed long takes, and in this era of 2 second takes, i can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to get those long scenes perfect. the music is great, and the songs move the story along just as they should. leslie bricusse is one of my favorite composers. listen to these songs, how could anyone not like them? this is a very romantic story between two people nearing middle age that find each other, bring out the best in each other, and it lasts till the end of their lives. excellent production values, acting, camera work, and music, make this movie well worth watching.
