with wwii over, movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home. "the best years of our lives" was probably the best example. it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre-war lives, but to the overall changing world. probably the most interesting cast member is non-actor harold russell. having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else; he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role. there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than "it's a wonderful life", but i certainly think that they did a good job with it. very well done.
