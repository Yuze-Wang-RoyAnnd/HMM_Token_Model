after you have seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies. nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film. i had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later. like "silence of the lambs" it features the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors, like "flatliners" the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure. the surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film, as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen. and beyond this continuity and "making sense" are not necessary, which makes it a film-maker's dream too.<br /><br />the only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. you actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from horrible deeds of the man. the focus swings as it must from saving the man to saving his victim.
