if you know anything about the manhattan project, you will find "fat man and little boy" at least an interesting depiction of the events surrounding that story. the film is in all ways a very realistic portrayal of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (such as some scenes involving radiation poisoning). paul newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come off like a real person on the screen. the supporting cast, such as john cusack, laura dern, bonnie bedelia, and natasha richardson, is fairly good as well. this film is not, however, one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie. great films are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep its audience engaged for the entire movie. this one, however, tends to drag a bit throughout, and some scenes (such as john cusack and natasha richardson's love story) could have been eliminated entirely without causing the film to lose much. nevertheless, there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous bits to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire film. it does not always entertain, but as far as great depictions go, this is very accurate, fascinating, and will leave the audience with something to think about.<br /><br />*** out of ****
