pepe le pew can either really creep you out or totally sweep you off your feet. either way, you can't help feeling a little awe on beholding this classic wb character. this commentater personally believes that pepe was the inspiration behind other would be animated casanovas today from cartoon network's "johnny bravo" to disney's lumiere from "beauty and the beast". <br /><br />his unique brand of love making is to be wondered at in today's world where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least a 50m distance from all his victims. <br /><br />in this particular cartoon, a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate makeover and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk. all goes well, until pepe arrives and promptly pursues the unfortunate feline with his overwhelmingly enthusiastic love-making.<br /><br />the groundwork for pepe's many trademarks are laid in this cartoon. from his adorable "frenchified" love calls to that aggravatingly calm hop-chase of his. <br /><br />this cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned, the most ardent wooer can go the distance...and have his beloved "pig-eon" leaving dust trails behind them.
