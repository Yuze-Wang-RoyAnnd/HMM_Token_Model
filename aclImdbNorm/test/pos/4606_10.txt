this is the ultimate, and i mean the ultimate, adventure classic! the plot is good versus evil. there have always been an abundance of films that depict gray areas, and not enough on the basic good against evil to account for the real cases of good against evil in the real world. only recently have film makers tried to even the odds. in real life well over half of situations are black and white, but only a fraction of movies make it seem that way. this movie is the best example of a back and white look. it is best seen in black and white. the hero is in the worst situation. he is in the territory of a man who wants to murder him, and among various enemies. the movie gives the feel that he is hopelessly outnumbered, and can't count on help. his enemy (the count), has numerous resources. the count's wife was forced into marriage with him, and she knows from his past history that sooner or later he will kill her as he does all his wives. she and the hero become allies and fall in love in away that could win over anyone watching (unless that person just wants to be a contrary brat). anyone who helps them is killed. they have no escape. the situation is hopeless. so will they survive in the end? you won't guess unless you've read spoilers. the movie also has a lot of great atmosphere, adventure, and intrigue, along with lon chaney as a bad guy, and boris karloff in his best role ever, as a decent guy. usually cast as a bad guy, karloff was at his best when presented with more complex roles such as this one. chaney was rarely given a complex role, although he strutted his stuff in a few movies such as "of mice and men." this is little more than a cameo for him. still, the tension never stops. there is suspense and danger throughout. perfectly written, perfectly cast, and perfectly directed. this is what a movie should be-pure escape, pure adventure.
