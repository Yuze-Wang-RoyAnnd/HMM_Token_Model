this movie was well done. it covers the difficulties a returning vietnam veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war. unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a vet who had been involved in an act of atrocity. i was in vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it. the offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in leavenworth.<br /><br />the notion that only vets involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disservice to all who served. all of the soldiers i knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of communism. the biggest problem was coming home to learn that many americans were opposed to the war. that is what caused many veterans to feel they had taken part in something less than honorable. not the manner in which they served.<br /><br />the ending depicted the father acting more as a belligerent bully than a loving, caring father. for that i gave it a 7 out of 10. had the ending allowed for a degree of acceptance i could have rated it a 9.<br /><br />most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional scars. they need acceptance and understanding to overcome that. i pray that the public is more understanding of our present day veterans than it was in the the vietnam era.
