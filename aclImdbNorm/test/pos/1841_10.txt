i saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. so charming and so very romantic. david duchovny and ms. driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. the supporting cast is 100% top notch. just watching caroll o'connor and robert loggia play off one another is pure poetry. bonnie hunt and jim bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. like jim belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep "forever!" or him dancing in the kitchen. this film made we wish i knew people like that in my own life. not to mention, what woman does not want david duchovny for a boyfriend?
