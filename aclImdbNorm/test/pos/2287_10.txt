this is an excellent, little known movie. tom selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie, with the japanese 'clint eastwood'. i'd love to see if this movie has come out on dvd yet, there are some spots that clearly have been cut. hiroku (tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts chopped. it would be interesting to see more of japan in the film. the baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie, i'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players. i love loading the tape of this movie at least once a year. best scenes involve the lack of hat tipping after tom gets beaned in the big game, and an intensely sensual scene of tom having a hot bath with hiroku. dennis haysbert also does a great job, it's good to see he's finally getting some recognition, not just in baseball movies(he was also in major league).
