suzumiya haruhi no y^uutsu (the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya) might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy/drama. well, it's not! the setting just happen to be a school environment. this is a comedy alright, but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm. and the characters does have a psychological sublimeness which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of ingmar bergman. the episodes is aired, as it seems, out of order, i.e. the pilot is in fact episode 11. this makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes. the show is an adaption of nagaru tanigawa's popular novel series about haruhi suzumiya.<br /><br />what about the story then? like in all the episodes does the story revolves haruhi suzumiya, who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking in adventures. haruhi her self has no interest in ordinary humans, and actively searches for aliens, time travelers and espers (persons with supernatural forces). to find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the sos-brigade (save the world by overloading it with fun: haruhi suzumiyas brigade). except for haruhi, the other members of the sos-brigade is kyon. he is the real protagonist of the show. it's trough his point of view that we follow the story. he just happen to sit in front in class when haruhi came up with the idea to form the sos-brigade. he is quite sceptical to most club activities and tags along just to ensure that haruhi don't go to much to the extremes, and he is the only one in the class that haruhi likes to talk with. another member is yuki nagato, which is the "indispensable silent member" and is also the only remaining member of the literature club, which room the sos-brigade has occupied in the quest for a free club room. she doesn't mind that the sos-brigade uses her clubroom, as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. she also participate in the brigades activities. mikuru asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by haruhi because the club needed a lolita-like mascot for anything suspicious to happen. she often act as the clubs maid. the last member is the always smiling itsuki koizumi, who happens to be the "mysterious transfer student" (meaning he transfered two months in to the semester which haruhi finds to qualifies as mysterious).<br /><br />haruhi thinks that all members but kyon are some random picked people in school, but the do indeed have their own interest in her.
