an unjustly neglected classic, "intruder in the dust" is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity. based on a story by william faulker, and shot in his hometown of oxford, mississippi, "intruder" tells the story of lucas beauchamp (played with great dignity by juano hernandez), a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man, and a white boy (claude jarman, jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to beauchamp. terrific acting, especially by two great character actors, porter hall (as the dead man's father) and elizabeth patterson (best known as mrs. trumbull on "i love lucy") as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done. this straightforward, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.
