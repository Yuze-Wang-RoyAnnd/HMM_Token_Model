roopa (kamalinee mukherjee) loses her parents and other family members in a gruesome car accident. she starts living on her own as an independent woman without taking any help from her relatives. she has a boy friend named rahul (anuj) and is about to get married to him, but backs out due to the behavior of her future mother-in-law and due to lack of confidence shown by her boyfriend. anand (raja) joins her neighborhood. and he starts making roopa feel comfortable and secure. the rest of the story is about why anand - md of the richest corporate house of ap - has chosen to reside as neighbor of roopa and what follows next.<br /><br />this movie has a freshness to it which we rarely see in indian movies to it. although the story goes slow, you get a sense of familiarity with it. kudos to the director shekhar kammula for such an awesome direction! brilliant music and background score composed by k.m. radhakrishnan adds to the quality. kamalini mukherjee as rupa has given a marvelous performance. i think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous looks and amazing histrionics. anand as raja has done well too. i have watched this movie thrice now and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. it is a class apart from the daily dose of action movies we get here. highly recommended!!
