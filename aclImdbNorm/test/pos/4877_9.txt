i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago. i enjoyed the film at that time, so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since. perhaps it's my memory, but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival. i'm really not sure which version i prefer, but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both.<br /><br />let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. although it's been promoted as a hammer films tribute, people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed. there's some cleavage, but no nudity (a staple of the british production house's later movies). and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy (it really is shot like a sixties film), and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt, it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution. this film is very dark, very confusing, and (at times) very funny. i don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one, but that's not a bad thing (especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short). and some of ms pitt's rantings are quite entertaining. it's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose.<br /><br />the uniqueness of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details, though. it's in the ideas. as an occasional sci fi channel viewer, i've regularly taken the network to task for its one-note variations on a theme (cgi monster kills, then gets destroyed). sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while.<br /><br />but don't get me wrong. i'm not complaining. if anything, i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low-budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts. it's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies (you know who you are). but for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films, the predictability, the lack of respect for the audience, this may just be your ticket.
