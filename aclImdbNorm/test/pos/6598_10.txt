i must say that this has to be the best documentary i have ever seen in my life. i first say the movie at my friends house, and didn't get a chance to finish watching it. from that point on, i spent my free time trying to find the movie. i never found it, but on my birthday, my friend who knew i had the hardest time finding the movie,got it for me as present. sean penn does a great job of narrating the documentary. i loved how it told the story of each of the z-boys and the history of dogtown. i have been to venice and the surrounding area many times, and had never known what had taken place, until i saw the documentary. i didn't get a chance to see the actual movie, and i heard it was nowhere near what the documentary was. i don't know if i actually want to see the movie, but who knows.
