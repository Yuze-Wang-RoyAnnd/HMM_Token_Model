i really loved this movie. i thought it was very well done. the character interaction was wonderfully done as was the characterization. the actors were definitely believable. the plot was very deep and intriguing. even though parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring, it's definitely worth watching several times. the chemistry between the three main actors was great. if you don't want to watch it for that, then at least watch it for the drama between the characters. i mean, the whole thing was just "whoa!" it was like i couldn't look away. the whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest, even through the slow parts. i loved this movie and almost everything about it. i loved the ending because it was so interesting and, if you watch the movie a second time, makes perfect sense. but i'm not spoiling anything.
