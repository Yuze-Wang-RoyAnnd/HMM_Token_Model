unlike some movies which you can wonder around and do other things, this movie kept me in front of the screen for the entire two hours. i loved every minute of it.<br /><br />however, i have to say that the story is not very believable. especially when the foreigner was expelled by the government, and then later on, actually sent a package to the guy who helped him. xiao liu is a very good actor, he shows his emotions, and he shows his silliness, and his love toward that girl.
