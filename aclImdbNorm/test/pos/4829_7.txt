'wicked little things' really separates itself from other zombie movies.first off, all of the zombies in the movie don't exactly starting biting at you and tearing your flesh apart with their bare hands.they kill you with either a pickax or shovel and eat you after wards.second, they can't die.in most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but these simply won't die.third, which is the biggest reason why this movie separates itself, all of the zombies are children.how did they die exactly to become zombies? they were working in a coal mine when suddenly they were all killed in a collapse.now they wander the forest carrying their pickaxes and shovels, waiting for someone to come by so they can kill them and eat them.oh, they also come out at night.yep, only at night.that makes the movie even more fun then it would be if they came out in the morning.despite all of the violent and gory mayhem in this movie, 'wicked little things' is a great choice if you're looking for a movie about zombie children.don't expect anything great like 'dawn of the dead' or 'land of the dead', but do expect lots of gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie fan pleaser.everyone give scout taylor-compton from rob zombie's 'halloween' a big hand for delivering a great performance like the one she did in 'halloween'.she really needs to start starring in more horror movies.
