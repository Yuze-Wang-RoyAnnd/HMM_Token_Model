i saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since. i have the dvd. it's one of drew barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once. <br /><br />not being popular in high school was one f the things in the film i could relate to. i wasn't quite as tortured as josie was (during her real high school days) or like aldys, but i was never the go- to-the-major-party type either. the prom scene were the three popular girls fall victim to their own prank as josie pushes way aldys (the intended victim) is my favorite scene and i clapped when i first saw it. <br /><br />i can still watch this movie today. it is excellent.
