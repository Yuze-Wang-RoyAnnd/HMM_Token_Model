why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down? it is cute and funny (exactly what it is meant to be). madonna wasn't out to prove herself as an oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow! she was just doing what the character called for, and she did it well. i loved her in this movie; it is my second favorite madonna movie after evita. the soundtrack is excellent too. it is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80's flick. to all the critics, just don't take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it. madonna is a goddess!!!
