'the cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and i mean this literally. the film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. in my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. in fact, the story is pretty good.<br /><br />we start with catherine deane (jennifer lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. how this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. she and other scientist including henry west (dylan baker) and miriam kent (marianne jean-baptiste) believe that this method might work. catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. she hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.<br /><br />the real story then. a serial killer named carl (vincent d'onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. fbi agents ramsey (jake weber) and novak (vince vaughn) are on this case. another girl (tara subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, carl can be traced and captured. two problems occur. 1. carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. his house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. in a way this part of the story is pretty standard.<br /><br />things are about to get interesting again. to find out where the girl is, catherine has to go into carl's mind. this is dangerous for a lot of reasons. in short: carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. if catherine starts believing carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of carl. a tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure catherine will try to get the location out of carl's mind.<br /><br />it is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. director tarsem singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. for me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'three kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. if something like that can make you like a film, 'the cell' will not disappoint. but fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. the story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. i think you have to be a little open minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. still, a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.
