i'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake moan. it's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though i think director craig brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. it's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though christina ricci's character, rae, typifies those. it's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. it's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. and it's certainly not about the south, where "everything is hotter," though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />black snake moan is a parable about mississippi delta blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.<br /><br />it's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, "ok, if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about, what would it look like?" so they set it in the rural south. then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know jesus wants their lives, and though they respect him, they know they can't give him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man son house on both ends, and voila -- you have a modern parable about what the blues are all about. even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.<br /><br />of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. rae (ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by lazarus' (jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) but then, we're shown the restored rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. i have my doubts.<br /><br />not for the first time, samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching samuel l jackson; the man is unbelievably good. he even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. christina ricci isn't usually this good, either. granted, half her job is done by the costume that wasn't there and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. i was impressed by the country preacher, john cothran, jr. i had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. the language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) plus, ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. i don't recommend this for kids of any age. adults only, please.<br /><br />that being said, black snake moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. it's unorthodox, but well worth the time. and, my goodness, is the sound track hot.
