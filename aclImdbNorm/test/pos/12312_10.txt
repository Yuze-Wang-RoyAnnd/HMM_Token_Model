this is really the only chance to see the magic of james joyce's writing brought to life. his novels are all unfilmable (in any real sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. it was john huston's last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died, and it is easy to see his touch of greatness. the dead is poetical in its approach on the screen, telling us more about ireland than any modern movie on the ira and "the troubles" could ever hope to tell us. hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both john huston and james joyce, and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper).
