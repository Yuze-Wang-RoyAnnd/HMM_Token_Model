this nifty little movie demonstrates the rock-solid virtues of a time, place and kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or even aspire to have. the saint is a paladin with only the best motives, to say nothing of a polished vocabulary and diction. no need to turn up the volume or read the dialog. george sanders is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, smarts, physical presence and above all, masculinity, seem, well, almost normal. some normal! george clooney can not begin to master the scene as mr. sanders does (and does without mr. clooney's mugging).he could play a sniveler (witness the ghost and mrs. muir and rebecca) but when he was good, he was very, very good. truly, a man for all reasons and seasons.
