after a couple years of searching for the humphrey bogart film, "two against the world", it unexpectedly showed up as a tcm offering under the title "one fatal hour", a first national film from 1936. bogey's character is sherry scott, the man who runs wubc, a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners. the owner bertram reynolds (robert middlemass), is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on scott.<br /><br />in an effort to boost the audience base and revenues, reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old murder case, and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play. scott enlists the aid of dr. martin leavenworth (harry hayden) to write the play and present it on the air.<br /><br />the pembroke murder case involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband, the circumstances of which are not made clear. however gloria pembroke has married, and is now living as martha carstairs (helen mackellar), married to a successful banker (henry o'neill), and their daughter edith (linda perry) is about to be married (on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of gloria pembroke). about to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation, martha and jim carstairs embark on a crusade to have the program stopped. simultaneously, edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place.<br /><br />without revealing the final outcome, the film takes a devastating turn to jolt the viewer. edith carstairs confronts the principals of the radio station, vigorously admonishing scott and the sniveling reynolds. while accepting his share of the blame for the outcome, scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job, firing his secretary, and hauling her out of the office, recognizing her for the conscience he once had. with an entirely abrupt finish, the film leaves one as disoriented and unsettled as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending. <br /><br />with about a dozen films under his belt, humphrey bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with intriguing results. with no name supporting players, bogey rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio offices, and runs the show as if it was his own. in an interesting bit of characterization, he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his bowed head, predating by a half dozen years a similar effect we'll see him do in "casablanca". for bogart fans, it's a genuine treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this.
