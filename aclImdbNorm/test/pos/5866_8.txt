there is only one racist joke in this daffy duck short, which is basically, when daffy rides black beauty, it is a black woman. i can understand partly why this joke was included, as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn't even illegal to discriminate black people yet.<br /><br />aside from this point, "a coy decoy" is basically a fun, interesting short where daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. i liked this short quite a lot (despite the other reviewers on here). the way daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing, yet highly amusing at the same time. porky is a nice edition to the episode, though it was not vital for him to be there. the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well, blood-thirsty, terrible animals, which of course they never really have been (unless they are very hungry). i also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode.<br /><br />for people who are totally into daffy duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons, enjoy "a coy decoy"!<br /><br />available on youtube.
