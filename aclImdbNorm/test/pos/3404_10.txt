i saw this movie when i was a lot younger but it captured me. i loved orry and george's relationship so much. i was so enraptured in orry and madenline's love story. i am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. i especially liked it when he first met her. i just wish he had more time with her and their baby. so you know in book three i was so hurt that he died. i didn't really understand that because they had little time together. i just loved patrick in this movie. i just bought all three books together and i can't stop watching them. my 12 year old son is stuck on it. he likes the fighting in the war. i cry every time. i wish i could meet patrick and madeline in person! it was a wonderful movie and cast!
