i saw it last night and i was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. the whole audience was. bruce campbell has made a damn funny movie! i don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and gets wacky, it gets really wacky. just one funny scene after another. my hats of to mr. campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. bruce was there to introduce the film and do a q and a, which was a treat. a lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame, but bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic. he was great! anyway, loved the film. i'll be looking forward to seeing this on dvd later this year. b sure to check it out on the sci-fi channel this fall. i highly recommend this one.
