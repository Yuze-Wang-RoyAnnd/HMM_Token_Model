the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events, and i've been a wrestling fan for a good few years now. the other shows may have better matches, but i've always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement.<br /><br />i'm not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don't see it as fair to ruin the results on a review. i will comment on the quality of them though.<br /><br />we have the standard 4 matches, and then the big rumble event. two from smackdown and two from raw.<br /><br />shawn michaels and edge open up for raw. this proves to be a good match from two talented guys. this is a match i'd recommend watching. it's hard to sum up without giving away the winner.<br /><br />next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster, be whoever it is. giant gonzales, yokozuna, kamala... well this time it's heidenreich. its also a casket match. typical undertaker fare. watch if you're a fan. i have to admit i am, purely for the entertainment factor. it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match.<br /><br />the next two matches are the title matches. for once smackdown manages to upstage raw. their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable, but with a anti-climax and let down to end it. raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair, which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved.<br /><br />now to the main reason i love the event, the rumble. it's a pretty good one this year. coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win, and it may not prove a big surprise, but hey, its very enjoyable. there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated. there is the token guy who doesn't make it to the ring, the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished, and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant. it has its usual highs and lows, and i loved the ending, in particular the vince mcmahon entrance.<br /><br />i'd recommend this show. not the wwe on top form, but its still good. add it to your collection.
