this is a really dark movie. noir indeed. the title character is smallpox, brought into new york city unknowingly by evelyn keyes.<br /><br />she is on one mission when she arrives and on a rougher one after she's spoken to her no longer innocent sister. but she herself is not intentionally a killer. this doesn't mean she doesn't kill. it doesn't mean her presence somewhere among eight million other people doesn't throw the city into turmoil.<br /><br />keyes is excellent. the supporting cast is very good too. there are several little-known people involved in this -- the director included. don't be put off. it is a movie to be reckoned with! (and how nice to see a columbia picture. columbia and republic turned out wonderful comedies and noirs; yet we hardly ever see them anymore.)
