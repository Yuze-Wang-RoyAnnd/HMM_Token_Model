fantastic russian wwii movie. like most russian wwii movies, the ascent is incredibly harrowing. it's also dense in its symbolism. the story follows two partisans, sotnikov and rybak (boris plotnikov and vladimir gostyukhin), who go on a mission to search for food. on their trip, they are spotted by german soldiers, who wound sotnikov. sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the germans, which leads to trouble for the two partisans and everyone else they later run into. the greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place. russia is frozen and snowy, and it's hard not to feel that cold go straight to your own bones. shepitko keeps her shot close to the characters, examining every crag of their faces. it was probably not the choice, but the film is framed 1.33:1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. while the entire film is quite an achievement, i did feel that the first half was stronger than the second. my main complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very unsubtle christian allegory by its climax. i just don't think the symbolism adds much to the proceedings, especially when i was already intrigued by the debate between the two partisans. it's not quite fair. i was weighing the pros and cons of their argument. i began to lean toward the point of view of a certain character, and then the director pops up and tells me that he's judas! despite some heavy-handedness, this is still a must-see.
