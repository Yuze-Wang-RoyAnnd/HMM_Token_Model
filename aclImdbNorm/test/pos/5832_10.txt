oz, was the first original television show that hbo put onto its channel (in the 1 hour forma) and it remains to this day the very best... the story is simple... oz is a surreal look into the lives of high maximum security prisoners at oswald, primarily focusing on "em city." now there are many things to compliment this show on from the writing (which in my opinion was the best on television when this show aired), directing (top notch), acting (best of the best), and the characters... this show just literally blew my socks off... this show was a critically acclaimed gem until the sopranos bowed, after that critics were salivating over that epic tale of trust and family to notice this compelling drama... oz to me is a better show than sopranos overall and it's a shame that i never won any major emmy's... =/<br /><br />kudos to all who were involved in this magnificent, gut - wrenching, show...<br /><br />kudos
