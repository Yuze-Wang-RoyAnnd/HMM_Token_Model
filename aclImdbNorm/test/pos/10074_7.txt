i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc, at the ziegfield. at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now. she had a couple of hits, was very good in "desparately seeking susan" and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium. <br /><br />"who's that girl?" gives madonna an actual role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. she does the madcap/heroine routine better than you might think. griffin dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans.<br /><br />the story involves a huge cat named murray, a bride-to-be who has slept with every cabbie in nyc, a mean father-in-law, and a key. there are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path. all the elements of a screwball comedy intact. <br /><br />sir john mills is seen briefly. he shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side, complete with a rain forest and everything. <br /><br />compared to most madonna movies (the ones i've been able to tolerate anyway), this is fantastic. on its own, its not that bad. 6/10.<br /><br />ps the concert was lousy.
