this film is one of those that can't be regarded by its outwardness. indeed, at a first sight, it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money. but..let's take a look on the other side...what do you see? you see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have:should i do the right thing, or should't i? and... what's the "right thing"? le's make a deeper analyses... -what does it mean a little town in the border? - it means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn't... - what does it mean the arid soil shown in this picture? - it means the dryness that sometimes take possession ot our offensed hearts... - what does it mean the phrase of the character (kristen) :"now i belong to him"? - it means the loss of our free will, due to our unpremeditated deeds. in my opinion that's the writer of the story and the director tried to "tell" us. by the way...do you remember what another character (jack barnes)said:"nothing is so simple..."
