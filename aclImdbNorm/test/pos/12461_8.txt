don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you. you'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes. however, if for no other reason, see "greystoke" to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role. ralph richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle shakespeare; rather, he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. he was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. his reading of the part of the sixth lord of greystoke, his last performance, is to be cherished by all who love the theatre.
