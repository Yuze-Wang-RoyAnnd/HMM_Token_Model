not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece. this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart. especially- women do not squelch your man's dreams -honor them -that's why you loved him in the first place! those who plan for death will live in the grave. those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear. even our lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the master. take a risk, get out of the boat and you will walk on water. life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls.
