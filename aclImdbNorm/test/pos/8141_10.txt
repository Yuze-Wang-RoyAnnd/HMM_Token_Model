my friend took me to a screening of this movie in hollywood and it was awesome! it's a film noir with amazing acting, great script, cool music, the whole thing was very well done and entertaining. don't know if it is getting a release in theaters, but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at blockbuster. this is the kind of movie i love, low on budget but big on style and imagination. i hope alexandra holden gets more big parts like she has in this one, she is fantastic.
