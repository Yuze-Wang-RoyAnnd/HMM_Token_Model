i actually though that black snake moan was great movie which takes place in the south. the story follows a man named lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. lazarus finds out that rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. samuel l jackson and christina ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that lazarus and rae become best friends. i was also amazed by sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. s epatha merrkensen is great as lazarus' love interest angela, justin timberlake plays rae's boyfriend ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.
