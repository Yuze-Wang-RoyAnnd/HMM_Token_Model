i did enjoy watching squire trelane jerk around the crew in this episode, though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long. sure, the histrionics were kind of funny for a while, and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together. i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing trelane when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to vanish when trelane became vindictive and nasty. talk about a mood killer--going from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing kirk to death! but, despite this, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time. for die-hard trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it's just a pretty run of the mill one.
