ice the limerick:<br /><br />a virus pulled out of the ice<br /><br />just didn't know how to play nice.<br /><br />if infected you'll kill<br /><br />because you are ill.<br /><br />the cure is to be infected twice.<br /><br />ice is a great episode; one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series. it starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also. a group of scientists in alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other. now mulder and scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. as mulder says this is either because they are brilliant or expendable. i take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else... the group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core. a little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of who-done-it paranoiac thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected. this is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor hodge who is un-trusting of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing he asks: to see everyone's credentials to "make sure we are who we say we are". events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them.<br /><br />there are a number of things i like about the episode and of course certain characters that i want to smack in the face from this episode, as well as a couple loopholes but most can be attributed to heightened caution and not thinking clearly. i like bear from the moment i first meet him. its a shame he has to die. i also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view as mulder and scully argue in the other room. it gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldn't assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets. as much as hodges frustrates me in this episode i do think that mulder was as much to blame for some of the rash actions taken as any. i really like scully in this episode. first of all she can tackle like a frickin linebacker! second i really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of mulder keep her from biasing her judgment. i love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all hugging and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says "bosom buddies". this is such great writing. a way to say without any words that scully is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend.<br /><br />unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe mulder to be infected since he discover's murphy's dead body even though they haven't inspected him at all to find out for sure. that was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood. but i guess i probably would have acted rashly in that situation too. but then stupid hodges decides that he has to assume mulder is infected even though mulder willingly surrenders and then is going willingly to be inspected and almost infects mulder in the process. luckily he sees that it is really dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a resolution. at least as much as you can expect from an x-file. the "government" wastes no time in torching the evidence as always happens in these cases and mulder is left with yet another frustrating "unsolved" case. in closing i give "ice" and easy 10/10 and i leave you with a haiku.<br /><br />"we're not who we are. it goes no further than this. it ends right here right now."
