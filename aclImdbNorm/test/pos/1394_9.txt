action packed,with my favorite type of creature.i won't give any of it away if you have'nt seen it,cause it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this film.it did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilled,where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out,probably the mood i was in at the time.special effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lulls.of course there'es a duschload of movies out there exactly like this,the film still has it's own style and flavor,which i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways.
