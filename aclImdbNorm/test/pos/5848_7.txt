not bad but could be loads better, also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama. you've got sandra bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you've got her placed with a new partner. there's a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway, and there's so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to scream.<br /><br />however, if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath. it's gripping and the subplots worked for me. well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase.
