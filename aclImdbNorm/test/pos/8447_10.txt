i work at a nuclear power plant, so i am getting a kick out of these replies.<br /><br />seriously, i do. go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palisades_nuclear_generating_station and you can see where i work.<br /><br />i could not think of a safer industry to work in. we are required by procedures to report events as minor as paper cuts. any issue identified as being a potential concern with respect to nuclear, radiological, or industrial safety is immediately reported in the corrective action process.<br /><br />bottom line is that nuclear plants in the us operate with safety in the front of their mind.
