of all the actresses in film today, kristin scott thomas would be my choice if i had to select one for stranding on a desert island.<br /><br />i could watch her simply, say, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. so it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films.<br /><br />however, i did enjoy this movie and its story, per se, more than that indicated by the average ranking among the many persons previously commenting on this site.<br /><br />harrison ford is not one of the actors, though, whose performances i enjoy most. but he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film, so who am i to argue?<br /><br />ford though is often droll in his acting style, and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and "random hearts" is in this grouping.<br /><br />his obsession in probing the losses, which both he and thomas have endured with regard to their linked spouses, is understandable, given his profession as a detective - but not to the level presented here. although not far, it crossed the line into the "annoying" category. <br /><br />however, most of the scenes after he and thomas became involved were interesting and well-played.<br /><br />this film could have been a 9*, but i'd lower it a couple of levels, based upon ford's overall performance, and and another, because it contained a bit more of the extraneous sub-plot elements than seemed required.
