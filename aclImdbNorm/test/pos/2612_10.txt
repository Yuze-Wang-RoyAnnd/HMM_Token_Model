assy mcgee is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate. otherwise, it's likely you'll miss the references to 80's cop films and simply think it's a running gag about a walking rectum. think it's brainless, infantile poop humor? go watch the stallone film 'cobra' and you'll see what i mean. this show actually has very subtle humor, which says a lot, both for a show that aired on adult swim, and for a show about a walking ass.<br /><br />all the standard genre clich'es are in place that made movies like dirt harry and cobra so great and ripe for parody. sanchez is assy's partner, who is - as per the genre - level-headed and constantly apologizing for his partner's homicidal behavior. the police chief is, of course, a fire-breathing hard case who lives to scream "i want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning!" the over-the-top, and sometimes completely nonsensical manner in which the 1980's 'renegade cop' film is parodied suits the subject matter well. for instance, while breaking up a bus robbery, one of the criminals stops to ask assy, "hey, where are you going, asshole!?" to which the title character snaps off the one-liner: "i'm going... to shoot you." <br /><br />highly recommended for anybody who loves 80's action movies, and has actually viewed enough of them to understand the humor.
