a beautiful film about the coming of early silent cinema to china. shadow magic deftly combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between china's ancient traditions and modern western culture in the form of film. an amazing first film by chinese director ann hu. if i correctly understood ms. hu's comments at the 2000 sundance festival, this film was produced as an american film with co-funding by the chinese government, and shot in china. shadow magic reminds me of films like il postino and cinema paradiso - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it has a similar feel.
