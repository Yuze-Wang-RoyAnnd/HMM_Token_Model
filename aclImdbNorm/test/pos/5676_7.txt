when i read the synopsis - 3 people lost in the wild battling against a huge crocodile - i wasn't exactly drawn in. it sounded like the typical yawn-movie horror formula of a bunch of people stalked by a monster - except in this case there are only three of them, so we wouldn't even get the macabre 'joy' of watching them get picked off one by one.<br /><br />however, i watched it (couldn't sleep; nothing else to do) and it turned out to be much better than expected. the acting is great, the atmosphere tense and you really get that rare sense of a low budget winner.<br /><br />horror as it should be done. first-rate film-making. it's not perfect but it's well worth seeing. i give it a 7.
