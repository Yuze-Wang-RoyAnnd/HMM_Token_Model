or any stories reminiscent of the leopold and loeb case, you may find this movie entertaining. the cast includes robert culp,with stephen caffrey and garrison hershberger as the college students.<br /><br />peter falk is his usual self, pretending to be tricked by the precocious students. caffrey ("longtime companion", "buried alive") is excellent, and should do more of these menacing roles. basically the two frat buddies become tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection, attendance at the best schools will only be financed if they conform. there is an excellent scene wherein culp rakes caffrey over the coals after he gets a low grade, threatens to cut off his trust funds and caffrey later says to his friend: "i hate him, i want him dead"...<br /><br />all is not well in beverly hills. this is always an excellent theme. i believe this film came out in 1990 right after the menendez killings. if you watch "menedez, a killing in beverly hills" and then compare it to this film, you may find some interesting parallels.
