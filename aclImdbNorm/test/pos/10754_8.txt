<br /><br />as a harold lloyd fan, i agree with the other reviewer's comments, except that i feel that "movie crazy" was his best sound film; "cat's paw" is a close second. (but, this is just my opinion).<br /><br />this film is a "hoot" from beginning to end and, in many scenes, george barbier (the crook that gets him elected mayor) almost steals the show! (especially at the end of the film).<br /><br />one wishes that una merkel's character would be a bit more sympathetic to harold, especially as the film progresses. only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him. (and, even then, there is no "romance" - kissing, etc).<br /><br />this is a must-see film!
