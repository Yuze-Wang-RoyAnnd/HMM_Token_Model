mel brooks really outdid himself with this hilarious stand-up of the robin hood story. the cast is perfect, and cary elwes does a fine job at his role. in my personal opinion (besides the fact that i'm a cary elwes fan) this movie is the best, and funniest, i've ever seen! it will have you laughing every time you see it!
