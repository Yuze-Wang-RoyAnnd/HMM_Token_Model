much better than it is generally given credit for, this version of "lost horizon" not only had great music and beautiful scenery, but also some stunning mountain photography. a special edition laser disc was released some years ago which added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music, and lots of bonus material. so why isn't this on dvd?! hard to figure the studios out sometimes. certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than peter finch, liv ullman, george kennedy and sally kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodious pipes? song and dance man bobby van is great fun, michael york is a suitably tragic villain, and seeing sir john gielgud decked out as chang may sound silly but actually works very well on screen. trust me, you need to check this movie out - if you can find it!
