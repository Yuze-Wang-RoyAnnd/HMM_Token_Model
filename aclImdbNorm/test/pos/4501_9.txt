i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan, a culture i know very little about. i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint. i watched this with someone who didn't read the book and he also enjoyed it. they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film. it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over. you feel for the characters and their plights. i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture. there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.
