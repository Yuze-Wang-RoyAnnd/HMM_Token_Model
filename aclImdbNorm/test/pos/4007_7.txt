i've been watching attack of the show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). i was very infatuated with olivia and i found kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. first my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called around the net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally). umm, this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff, i really haven't seen anything that good and i can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times. the show is like a late show wanna be/colbert report wanna be with it's politics also, if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal, this humor gets old also, mccain is old, yeah yeah, whatever. libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves, so it's almost every show bash mccain or palin, sheesh. so we get the same old vids of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never laugh's at itself out of it's own weakness. i'll keep watching since i watch at work and it's all that's on, hoping that i'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old. i did like the fill in host's of chris and alison though, they were actually a good change of pace; maybe this show could do a rotating host thing. olivia who i thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it's getting old, lol. 7 of 10; it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger baby boomer like me (mid 40's). maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do, there is a ton of stuff available they could use.
