without a doubt, this is the big momma of all music videos!!! unlike most music videos that are either "dance videos" badly storied and/or badly interrupted lyrics this was done right. jackson was co-writer and by evidence of vh1 heavily choreographed and directed this masterpiece. in fact you could say thriller is creepier then most horror movies with that last second sparkling eye. to me this music video is what you judge all other music videos on. you can easily see the ominous influence m.j. had on early break-dancing with the zombie march number. because of the dancing, comedy, storyline, and yes horror. i give it a 5 of 5.
