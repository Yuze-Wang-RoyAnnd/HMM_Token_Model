everyone told me to see "cactus flower," and i finally did. what a wonderful movie -- the perfect pick-me-up for a sunday night/dreading monday morning. matthau and hawn were good, but ingrid bergman really made this movie -- after all, it was really about her. the truly great actors can do anything, and miss bergman proves it. she shows us -- in the course of one film -- a range few people display in their entire career. the scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching. even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion, i found myself cheering for miss dickinson as if she were the boston red sox. thankfully, she made out (no pun intended) much better. ;)
