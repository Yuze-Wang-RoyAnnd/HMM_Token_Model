just see it! it's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. see it more than once. everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. the clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. the structure is non-linear and cyclical. motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. expectations regarding "plot" and character" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity. this is a part of a review: "usa the movie is emotionally intense, intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing, in surprising and unconventional ways." dion dennis, phd
