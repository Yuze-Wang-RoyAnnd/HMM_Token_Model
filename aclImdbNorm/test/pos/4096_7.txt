this version of "the lost horizon" is actually not a bad film at all. i think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. i saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (i was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (burt bacharach has always been a favorite.) the story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all. i have this film on video and watch it every so often...and i enjoy it each and every time!
