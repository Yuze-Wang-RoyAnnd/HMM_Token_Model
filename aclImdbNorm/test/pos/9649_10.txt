this is a very long movie, indeed. but it is quite beautiful, and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. a story easily told cannot be expected in les amants r'eguliers, but every scene, every silence here tells much more than a hundred dialogs. touching, different, perfect in its pictures and soundtrack, showing why the close brought by the cinema as one of its main features became the greatest innovation in any dramatic representation. someone who is used to that kind of movies where everything is told, and action takes place all the time, will find this tiring. but it is worth watching, to find out other possibilities of feeling a story.
