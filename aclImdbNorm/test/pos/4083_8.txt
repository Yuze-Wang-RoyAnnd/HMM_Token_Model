i caught this on local mexican television at 2:00 a.m. and i decided to give it a chance since it's based on a real life case that deals with the murder of the typical all american family (a dad, a mom, and a young son).<br /><br />on the beginning the hints point to walker to be the murderer as he had strong differences with his father. shortly after, when walker and luke are taken to the sheriff's dept. to being examined by the lies detection machine, things turn out to be very different...<br /><br />also, when walker and luke attend to an appointment with their father's lawyer, they learn that luke would receive $200,000 and walker is out of the heresy. luke immediately buys a convertible.<br /><br />anyways, this is an excellent mystery movie that deals with betrayal, ambition, feelings, and cold , very cold blood.<br /><br />i know the real names were changed but still the experience is the same. give this movie a try. i know there are hundreds of "based on real murders" or events of the like, but this one is truly worthy. pure quality on acting, direction, and plot.
