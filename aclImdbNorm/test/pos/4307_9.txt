do you liked "dead man don't wear plaid"? what about "top secret" and "a chorus line"? well m"ullers b"uro is a fantastic melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. very funny "tongue in cheek" movie noir hommage with stunning songs and great dancing. you have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. i've voted it a nine, if the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. thats how good that movie is.
