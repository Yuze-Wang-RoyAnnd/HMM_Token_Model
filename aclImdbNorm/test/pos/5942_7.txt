i must i was a little skeptical when i entered the cinema to watch oss117 : french comedies tend to be so self-satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones score high at the national box-office. but i was surprised that though the humor does not always reach the level of the monthy pythons, the many references to the french's vision of the world in the 1950, which oss117 represents, are hilarious et the director managed to recreate film-making style of that time with an astonishing fidelity. to put it short, a bit of a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary actors. and at least for once, jean dujardin's style (which can get on many people's nerves) complies perfectly with the character he plays.
