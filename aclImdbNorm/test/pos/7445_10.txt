haven't played the game? don't bother. this is for the final fantasy vii fans out there that beat the game, and no other will appreciate this rare gem of a movie. want to watch it and love it? buy the game, beat it and then watch it. when's the last time you've seen an excellent movie based on a video game? well, this is it.<br /><br />the story takes place two years after the game and no short summaries are given to refresh your memory (though i doubt many would forget), and goes right into the one hour and forty-one minute adventure.<br /><br />all your favorite characters are there, even cait sith. the voice acting is superb in the japanese version, every character is cast perfectly. cloud sounds tough and broody, tifa sounds kind yet strong...aeris is also perfect, she sounds exactly as i imagined. cait sith sounds less cute than i imagined, but worked very well.<br /><br />the character models are spectacular, great textures and lighting. the environments are breathtaking and the battles are choreographed in a way to make the matrix blush. the amazing camera work comes through in the bike chases, for example, where your eyes are just screaming in satisfaction and your lungs breathing heavily without consent.<br /><br />the music is typical uematsu quality, which means its top notch. familiar tunes are remade to accompany advent children's graphical leap, which meshes with the visual aspects very well. there's even an inside joke for the fans that involves music, it'll make you smile for sure.<br /><br />i did not watch it with subtitles since i'm half-japanese so i can't say that the subtitles are any good. in japanese, however, the dialogue is very good and every word sounds like it's coming from real living beings, not just actors. impressive. i'll watch this again someday with subtitles to see the differences since i've played both the japanese and american release of final fantasy vii.<br /><br />if you are a fan of final fantasy vii, buy this movie the day it comes out or pre-order it. if you haven't played the game but want to see this movie very badly, don't waste your time: buy the game, beat it, and then come back for this dvd. i won't tell you to not watch it, but play the game. it'll make the experience a lot better and won't leave you in the dust scratching your heads.<br /><br />come back, old friends - it's time to go on an adventure again with your brave comrades!
