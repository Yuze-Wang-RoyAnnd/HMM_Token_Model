never have i sat down for six hours straight to watch a miniseries, but changi changed that. i'm not going to lie, i know some aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring (actually, i quite like aussie flicks myself but maybe i'm biased) but changi is on a completely different lane. although not historically accurate, as we are continually reminded, the show combines superb acting, an excellent script and the addition of humour to provide us with an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a pow camp in wwii.<br /><br />keep in mind, the show was not supposed to be a documentary so don't let any factual errors disappoint you. <br /><br />this series exposes such creative writing by john doyle (aka roy slaven)who is known more for his comedy than anything else, and an excellent director and actors move this creativity along perfectly. if you want to see how much hard work went into this series, visit the official website, it is really interesting and you'll learn a lot about true accounts of changi. <br /><br />if you haven't seen changi yet, make sure you are doing nothing for a whole day because you'll want to watch the series in its entirety.
