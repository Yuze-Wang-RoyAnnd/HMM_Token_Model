as an ex (nuclear) submarine officer i must admit this is my favorite submarine movie (even exceeding hunt for red october). someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. ok - not realistic - but it is a comedy - and has all of the "inside jokes" from the submarine force. a great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the "orlando" and our heroes on the diesel boat. definitely "dbf" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. but they want ten lines in order to post this - jees is the admiral in charge here? <br /><br />line 10.
