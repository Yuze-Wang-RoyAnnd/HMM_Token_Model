whatever you do, don't stop watching when you think the movie is over! hang around for the first batch of credits or you'll really miss something! we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch. dreya weber is a marvel really, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull it off so far above the ground. at the q&a she said there were no wires or effects, so everything you see is really her going for it. addie couldn't make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna. she was excellent and, my gawd, so beautiful. i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd, but there you have it, savannnah isn't a backwater.
