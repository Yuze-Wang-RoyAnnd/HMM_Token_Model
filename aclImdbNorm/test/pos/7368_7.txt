i recently bought this movie for three bucks at a garage sale, and while i'm glad i didn't have to pay the usual $19.99 for this dvd, i was pleasantly surprised by how good the film was.<br /><br />it's set up like a horror anthology, broken up into 5 tales, including the 'connector' story which involves four teenagers who's car breaks down a dark, lonely road in the middle of the night. apparently, these kiddos like horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until morning - tell spooky stories around a campfire. each character takes their turn telling a story, after which their own story is wrapped up with a nice little twist.<br /><br />the first story, "the hook" is kinda a waste of time, a bit bland and dull. luckily, this is not one of the main stories and only lasts maybe 5 minutes. it's intended merely to introduce the film and it's easy to overlook the unoriginality of this piece.<br /><br />the second story, "the honeymooners" is, eh, okay. it's about - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon! they're traveling around in an rv headed to las vegas. they decide to stop somewhere for the night, but they're quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the location, or risk being attacked by some dangerous, unknown creatures. this story has a pretty good setup, but just merely an 'ok' delivery. basically, it's fairly entertaining and mysterious till the monsters show up, then it's just kinda iffy.<br /><br />the third story, "people can lick too" is my personal favorite. it involves a young girl who's parents are going out for the night and who's older sis is ditching her for a party. so, she's going to be all alone - a fact she makes known to an internet buddy of hers. trouble is, that internet buddy? is not exactly a thirteen-year-old girl. this story's conclusion is slightly less climatic than i might have liked to have seen, but still pretty dang good.<br /><br />the final story, "the locket" is definitely the one packed with the most atmosphere. set in a creepy mansion on a dark, rainy night, it's the tale of a young man (played by glenn quinn!) traveling around on a motorcycle who stumbles across this house just at the time that he conveniently has a problem with his bike. he meets the mute girl who lives in the house, and falls in love with her at first sight. unfortunately, not everything is all fine and dandy - and it might have something to do with that locket hanging around her pretty neck...<br /><br />after the stories are wrapped up, we're presented with a twist involving the four teens in the car, a twist which, in retrospect, should have been obvious, but which it didn't really see coming, and it's a quite pleasing conclusion to film.<br /><br />so, all in all, a good movie. rent it if you can, because unfortunately, i don't really think it has a lot re-watching value. but next time you're in the mood for a vaguely scary litte flick in the same vein as "tales of the darkside" or something, grab this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights, and treat yourself to this surprisingly nifty little flick.
