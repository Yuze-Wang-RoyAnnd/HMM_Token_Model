i wasn't even born when this series was released in the usa. it took about another decade before british tv networks laid hold of it.<br /><br />in fact, i was fortunate enough to see the very first episode, in which the lone ranger was one of a posse who ran into an ambush and got slaughtered. tlr was the only survivor. although badly wounded, he was saved by a passing indian called tonto. i believe he took to wearing a mask in order to hide his true identity for fear of reprisal. but instead he made himself all the more recognisable. dunno if he wore it in his sleep.<br /><br />this was saturday teatime staple. the fanfare bugles of william tell's overture presaged a dash to the telly, food still in hand. though it very quickly became repetitive, predictable hokum. nobody ever unmasked him. nobody ever landed a punch, nobody ever out-shot him. he was a little too good, and just a little too camp in his dress for most kids. poor tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt sally. he was always getting slugged and tied-up and kidnapped and stuff.<br /><br />and what did he keep calling the lone ranger? 'king savvy' was the general consensus where i lived. it seemed to imply 'the big know-all' in indian-speak. but is sounded like something else, as if mr silverheels had a speech defect. 'kemosabe'; what the hell's that? <br /><br />a later, and less well-merchandised duo called 'the range rider' and 'dick west' eventually won my vote. this featured a naked-faced jock mahoney who got beat-up pretty thoroughly in each episode and was altogether less camp, less super, and more believable.<br /><br />still; even today i can't hear william tell's overture without expecting the gallop of hooves and a hearty hi-oh silver.<br /><br />devine daftness.
