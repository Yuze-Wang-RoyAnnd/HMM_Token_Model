if you love vampire lore and are a fan of gothic horror, then you might want to check out soul's midnight. i did not know much about this movie before i watched it, and i wasn't expecting much, but i found the movie to be fun and entertaining.<br /><br />starring armand assante as the leader of the vampires simon, soul's separates itself from other low budget vampire flicks by weaving in the mythology of st. george and the dragon in a fun new way.<br /><br />i'm not sure what the budget for this movie was, but i sense that if it was a little more then they might have really been able to hit home the gore and effects.<br /><br />if you're up late one night and you're in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then soul's midnight is a good choice.
