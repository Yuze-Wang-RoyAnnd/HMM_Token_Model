despite all of the comparisons to house of frankenstein, this movie outshines its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the universal monsters series, and sadly, the last. o.k. so it doesn't exactly stack up to something like the bride of frankenstein as one a classic to revered by fans of all movies, but with a cast of dracula, the wolf man and frankenstein's monster (what? no mummy?) you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest! and unlike house of frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact a lot more. but this movie also offers some unique story lines for both dracula and the wolf man who both go to dr. adleman for cures of their afflictions. while the wolf man actually does find a cure, dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins! i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. but remember, i never said it was good, just fun.
