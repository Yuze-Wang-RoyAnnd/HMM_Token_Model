i will freely admit that i haven't seen the original movie, but i've read the play, so i've some background with the "original." if you shuck off the fact that this is a remake of an old classic, this movie is smart, witty, fresh, and hilarious. yes, the casting decisions may seem strange, but they work. <br /><br />i'm a staunch feminist, and i wasn't offended in the slightest by this movie--despite what other women might be saying. this is not a movie for men to see (so please, ladies, don't drag your guys to see it with you, that's just cruel); women will get the jokes, the situations, and the relationships. <br /><br />i was pleasantly surprised by the depth that annette bening brought to her character...she did an excellent job. debra messing was adorable, and candice bergen was fantastic. i was less impressed by meg ryan...she brought emotion to the table, but her comedic take on it was less strong. the all-female cast is strong, and it definitely a laugh-out-loud sort of comedy. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and fully intend to go see it again with my mother. women will understand.
