loosely based on actual events, "river's edge" is a film, much in the style of david lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but no one does anything about it for a long time. with top notch acting by crispin glover and dennis hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film.<br /><br />the film begins with a young boy, tim (joshua john miller), dropping a doll off of a bridge (murder #1). tim then hears someone yelling, when he looks up he sees samson (daniel roebuck) standing on the bank of the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him (murder #2). samson eventually shows the body to his friends. all of which are horrified, not only because of the murder, but also because the victim, jamie (danyi deats), was a friend of theirs. despite all of this, no one goes to the police. you may think this is unrealistic, but this is what happened in the real story. if you are familiar with the story of "alpha dog" (2006) you will know that the same thing happened there as well. through all of this, layne (crispin glover) is working to keep samson safe, although no one (including samson) seems to care about keeping him out of harms way. as time goes on we learn that feck (dennis hopper), a middle aged shut in who deals drugs to the local teenagers, has also killed a woman before (murder #3). from here things begin to close in on samson and his friends and eventually everything is revealed, but not in the way you may be expecting.<br /><br />in the film we learn of three murders, each one with a different reason, a different reaction, and a different effect on those involved. when tim drops his younger sister's doll off of the bridge, we are never made aware of his motive. however, we do see the reaction of the younger sister. she cries and screams while her mother consoles her. later, her older brother, matt (keanu reeves), helps her put a cross in the yard in remembrance of her doll. the murder of jamie horrifies everyone (except samson who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when asked by layne why he did it, samson replies with, "she was talking sh*t."), but they do not sob or scream, the run away and go on with their lives trying to forget what had happened. in feck's situation, he did not kill his girlfriend out of hate. we never really know why he killed her, but we see that feck is not proud of what he had done. he even mentions that he is sorry, and that her loved her. from this we see the different ways we can be affected by death. in the film, it is easy for us to identify with the teenagers, because they do not know what they feel, or how they should feel about the death of their friend. in much the same way, we, the audience, do not know how to feel, because we do not know jamie. we are obviously saddened by the death and realize that samson should be arrested, but we don't feel strongly for jamie as an individual.<br /><br />there are several similarities between "river's edge" and "twin peaks" (1990-1991), especially in the overall feel of the film. i wonder if mark frost and david lynch were thinking of "river's edge" when they were creating their series. after all, tim hunter did go on to direct three episodes of "twin peaks".<br /><br />crispin glover's performance as the hyperactive, frantic layne is an oscar worthy performance. always in a rush and always worried about keeping samson from getting caught, layne is an intense character that seems to be on speed. if you have seen crispin glover in any film, you know that he can deliver a line like no one else. it is always a treat to see him perform. the other great performance in "river's edge" is by dennis hopper. his portrayal of feck, the shut in drug dealer who has one leg and an inflatable sex doll he talks to named elly, reminded me of a more toned down and more humorous version of frank booth, hopper's character in david lynch's film, "blue velvet" (1986).<br /><br />river's edge is great film and i believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic, when in reality we need to step up and speak out against the evils in the world.
