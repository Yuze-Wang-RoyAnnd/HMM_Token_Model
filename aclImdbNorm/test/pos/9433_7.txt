sir arthur conan doyle wrote a fair number of sherlock holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective insured that sequels in both print and on film would extend far beyond the author's works.<br /><br />in "sherlock holmes and the secret weapon," holmes, basil rathbone, patriotically serves british intelligence in order to secure a swiss scientist's desperately needed bombsight. the film is from 1942 and i wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital bombsight secrets were (the american norden bombsight was guarded almost as zealously as the new radar sets that would change the course of world war ii).<br /><br />holmes and his faithful but expectedly bumbling companion, dr. watson, nigel bruce, battle dr. moriarty, lionel atwill. as evil as moriarty has always been it's a bit of a shock to see he's signed up with hitler. has the man no vestige of decency? i guess not. but atwill is deliciously evil.<br /><br />the story is reasonably fast-paced as holmes and watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a u-boat. rathbone is his usual suave self and several holmsian disguises are well carried out.<br /><br />this and other 1940s holmes stories are now available on dvd and oldies.com has put out a very nice four-disc set in a wooden box: this film is included along with a bonus cd of an interview with the aged doyle. the set retails for about $26 in major dvd and cd stores but i found this and other sets from oldies.com at a warehouse club for $14.98. the transfers are very good.<br /><br />very nice and relaxing late night viewing.<br /><br />7/10.
