i agree with all the strenghts mentioned in the other reviews but there are some beats missing here that keep it firmly inside the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit it from being a great drama beyond the limits of the "elements" that make up film noir--not to say that the great film noirs aren't/can't/shouldn't be also great dramas, but this one isn't.<br /><br />one other note the music in the film is used sparingly but i would say is used to accentuate the action more frequently than the wife elements.<br /><br />great set up to this film by the way with an abrupt sort of non ending ending that is either just right or a let down depends.<br /><br />spoilers follow as to some specifics.<br /><br />the big turn in the story involves the children seeing their mother die, or it should be the big moment. but the children are never shown to react one way or the other. neither cries, neither asks their father what happened, the kids are good actors and the reactions of the father are i suppose what matters but this is a big misstep. this is the heart of the story and the kids are kept mostly blank in their reaction. they really just have none, in the next scene they look as if nothing happened.<br /><br />in like fashion there is a bond that forms between belmondo and ventura's characters. belmondo says he knew the partner who was killed--but this is never explained and has no impact dramatically on belmondo or anyone else. the belmondo romantic subplot also strains credibility though it's convincingly acted. ventura's character just lets belmondo involve a total stranger in their escape plan for no reason. he doesn't even comment or seem to notice. another gap.<br /><br />the ending to the movie, and i won't spoil it, the ending happens off screen with a perfunctory voice over to tell you what happened. i guess this tries to make it feel more true to life, but again like these other missteps leaves drama off screen.<br /><br />what's the point of not dealing with these issues? i don't know, other than maybe the goals of the film were limited to giving the audience what it wants from a crime melodrama--suggest some deeper elements, then move on to ignore them.<br /><br />too bad there is much to recommend this film, ventura is very very good, but too bad it could have been a great drama as well as a crime story--as with imdb favorite movie of all time the godfather. this film had potential. would make for a good remake though if done in the u.s. more problems would probably sink the film, but in the hands of the right director this would be a good remake,though it's doubtful ventura's performance could be topped.<br /><br />so worth seeing but frustrating as a whole
