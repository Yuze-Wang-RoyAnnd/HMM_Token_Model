in the line of fire, in my opinion, is an excellent, suspenseful, and edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller! i thought that agent horrigan (clint eastwood) and agent raines (rene russo) looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner. as for leary (john malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to toy with frank by phone. he looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film, though. one thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between agent horrigan and agent raines. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job, i loved the setting, and i couldn't get enough of it. now, in conclusion, to all you clint eastwood fans who haven't seen this excellent, suspenseful, and edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller, i highly recommend it.
