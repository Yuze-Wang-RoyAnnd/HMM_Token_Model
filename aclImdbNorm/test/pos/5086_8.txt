when i was a kid i remembered this show but thought that now as an adult the show might be a bit dated. well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro (and the musics very funky). <br /><br />this show is mostly well written. i do think its a travesty that this show was cancelled after one season especially when this show was more popular than the incredible hulk. <br /><br />i think fans should overlook the poor special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /><br />this next sentence contains spoilers: my favourite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman that battle against each other interestingly a similar idea is concocted in spiderman 3 the movie. i liked the ideas in this tv show some will hate it. i believe stan lee wasn't a fan.
