this super creepy southern gothic melodrama stars clint eastwood as a wounded confederate officer in the civil war who's taken in by a rural girls' school and nursed back to health. a weird clash of genders ensues, with the supposedly "dangerous" male falling prey to a batch of seemingly harmless women, who prove themselves to be every bit as brutal as the men waging war on one another at the battle fronts. this is a classic spider and the fly story, but here there's one lone fly and a whole bunch of spiders.<br /><br />geraldine page plays the head mistress of the school, and she gives a characteristically sensational performance. page was trained as a theater actress, and it shows in all of her performances. no matter what role she played, she always committed herself 100% to it, and never once let herself drop out of character. so it is here, with this lethal spinster, who takes her sexual repression out on this helpless man. each of the other girls responds to him in her own particular way as well. the two most prominent are the slutty girl who can't wait to throw throw herself at him, and the virginal one (played by who else but the mannered elizabeth hartman?) who acts like she would fall over in a dead faint if someone so much as said the word "penis" to her. the schematic madonna and the whore storyline would seem heavy-handed if the movie didn't keep you so off-kilter and so completely unsure of what was going to happen next.<br /><br />the most memorable scene in the film for me occurred when the group of women perform an amputation of eastwood's leg, which has become infected with gangrene. again, the spider/fly allusion is clear: they hobble him so that it's that much harder for him to escape their web.<br /><br />a classic chiller. not a great film, but a morbidly entertaining one.<br /><br />grade: a-
