i've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy. having been born too late to see 'hair' in its contemporary setting, i have just been familiar with the uk and broadway cast recordings for many years; and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still, great fun.<br /><br />the film. it drops some of the songs (the bed, my conviction, frank mills) and cuts others (walking in space). however, what is left is presented very well indeed. all the singers and dancers are excellent, and the key performers (especially treat williams as berger, beverley d'angelo as sheila, john savage as claude) are memorable.<br /><br />as a hippy celebration and anthem, 'hair' manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late. it was no longer the era of peace, love, and biba, but the time of punk rock ... although watching this film now, in the time of iraqi problems, gives a new resonance to the vietnam issues of the 1960s.<br /><br />milos forman, who also made 'amadeus', did a good job on directing. in its scope and feel it reminds me of norman jewison's 'jesus christ superstar', especially with the joy of the 'aquarius' scene and the intimacy of 'easy to be hard'.<br /><br />i really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era.
