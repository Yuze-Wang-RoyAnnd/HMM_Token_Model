i rank opera as one of the better argento films. plot holes and inconsistencies? sure, but i don't think they impair this film as much as many other reviewers seem to. a lot of elements that are in many of argento's films are kinda "off-the-wall", but that's part of the draw of his films...<br /><br />short story: psycho stalks the opera's new leading lady. the typical argento twists and turns ensue, leading up to a decent payoff of a climax. not argento's best, but i still pull this one out from time to time. definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff - just don't get this one mixed up with the abysmal phantom of the opera remake that argento did, that one is truly awful... 8/10
