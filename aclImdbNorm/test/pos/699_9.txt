glenn ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner edger buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot. with ford a no-show, the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice, leaving ford on the hook for killings he didn't commit.<br /><br />columbia pictures' first color feature, the desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle.<br /><br />this has the irresistible teaming of a young glenn ford (third-billed but essentially the star) and a prime randolph scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles, including scene-stealer edger buchanan as a good-natured but mildly villainous yokel who isn't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines.<br /><br />a fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama, and comedy, well directed by charles vidor. this is one of the great westerns of the nineteen-forties and highly recommended.
