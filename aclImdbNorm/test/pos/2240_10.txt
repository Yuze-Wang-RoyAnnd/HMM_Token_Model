i'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie:<br /><br />#1 angelina jolie sex scene <br /><br />#2 foley artist outdid themselves <br /><br />#3 plot was quite thick <br /><br />#4 dvd does includes trailers and chapter stops<br /><br />#5 no animals were harmed in the making of the movie <br /><br />#6 homages to blade runner through out the film <br /><br />#7 burning trash cans <br /><br />#8 funny guy with no legs <br /><br />#9 voice overs by jack palance added a real dynamic element to the film. <br /><br />#10 sage advise, for example "when you dine with the devil bring a long spoon". <br /><br />#11 angelina jolie was only 18! <br /><br />to sum it up: an evening of entertainment was provided.
