all budding filmmakers should watch this movie - it is like a masterclass in digital film- making in itself. some of the scenes look like they have been shot on much higher production values than what they really have been. it is very encouraging that such a well crafted piece of work can be made on a low budget. the acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, particularly that of the lead boy (john kielty), who manages to play a teenager experiencing difficulties whilst remaining really likable. his beautiful but fading mother was also very well portrayed, and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing. this is a very quirky, interesting piece and i will be looking for anything else made by the same team. the director is certainly one to watch.
