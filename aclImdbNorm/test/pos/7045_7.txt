the quintessential "let's get ready for summer movie." it's dumb, goofy, and maybe a touch dated, but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as i did when i first saw it. in the style of all "little guys versus the establishment" movies, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and funny. and no, it's not bill murray at his bill murrayest, but he is starting to stretch out in what was his first starring role. odd, though, to see how few of the "fresh young faces" in this film went on to do much more.
