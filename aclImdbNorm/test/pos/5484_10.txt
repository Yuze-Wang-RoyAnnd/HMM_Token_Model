i just saw this movie for the first time last night. wow! what a movie! this is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting.<br /><br />i do not want to give a single word about the plot because i think it would be better for people to go in cold. do not read the plot summary before you see the movie! all i'm going to say is that eastwood, malkovich, peterson, and the screenplay by jeff maguire are top notch. i wish all thrillers were more like this one.
