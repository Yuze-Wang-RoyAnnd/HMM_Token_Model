the french babbette appears at the modest house of two danish sisters wet, cold, and alone. fleeing revolution in paris, she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the windswept jutland coast.<br /><br />unbeknownst to those who so generously take her in, she is a great chef, an artist of food. babette gives herself to her adopted community through thrift, productivity, and shared faith. she leaves only when she wins the french lottery--10,000 francs. she returns laden with exotic cargo, the makings of a single meal commemorating the birthday of the sister's father, the community's founder.<br /><br />this meal looms darkly in the minds of the pleasure-denying faithful but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who, as a young man in paris, learned to appreciate the sensory experience unfolding here. the meal is the film's climax, a communion of love in the transitory artistry of food--unaffectedly uplifting about art, love, and the meaning of life.
