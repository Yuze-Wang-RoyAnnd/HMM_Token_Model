a film to divide its viewers. just criticism points at its funereal pace, over-used snap zooms and persistent, lingering gazes between the protagonists. advocates point to dirk bogarde's mighty performance and pasqualino de santis' benchmark photography of venice.<br /><br />taken altogether, this might suggest an indulgent, romanticised elegy for the nobility of homosexual love (at a time, 1971, when it was becoming consensually legal). in fact visconti has succeeded in making a richer, more complex film than such a single-issue vehicle. he has knit his ideas - foibles and all - into a meticulously paced arc.<br /><br />inside this does indeed sit the central performance of bogarde's aschenbach. rather than a simpering, johnny-come-lately gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in tadzio. his mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob (and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback).<br /><br />mahler's music is possibly a little over-used although it is well appropriated. the italian overdub is a wearing anachronism but thankfully the acting doesn't suffer too much. 7/10
