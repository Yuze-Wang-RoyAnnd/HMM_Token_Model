this is a sort of hidden gem. it has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! one of the great directors of cinema, fritz lang, has created a real gem in this excellent western. a fine cast led by randolph scott (in probably one of his greatest performances), the always sturdy dean jagger, robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors: chill wills, slim summerville, john carradine, barton maclane and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country. it has tense drama, sprinklings of humor and great effects. it's reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it. at very least this is a damned good western!
