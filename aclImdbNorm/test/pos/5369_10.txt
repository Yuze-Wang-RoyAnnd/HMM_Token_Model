i was 10 or eleven years old when this movie came out, and it has stayed with me for 35 years since. when the movie came out, all of the theaters in the st. louis area distributed, as a 'lure', a pack of flower seeds that had the movie name, etc. on the front. on the back of the pack it read, in so many words....plant these seeds at midnight. if a white flower grows, you are saved.....but if a red flower grows, you are doomed!!! suffice it to say, that for an eleven year old kid, i did not plant the seeds for fear of what may pop up. here is the spoiler: as the movie starts out, you see a small toy tank moving about in the dirt. on a small road a family is leaving town, and suddenly the camera turns to the tank again, and it is full size. it rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage, then, just as sudden, the tank is small again.<br /><br />the reason this movie stuck with me for that long, was because i had a exact toy tank as the one in the movie!!!! unfortunately i don't know what happened to it, but i did keep a wary eye on that thing ever since!!!<br /><br />turn out the lights, put in the dvd, make a sandwich, and watch this movie. it is very good!!!
