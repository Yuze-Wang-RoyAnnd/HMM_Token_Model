i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films. i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - i was a little drunk and tired.<br /><br />i went to bed, and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep. i couldn't stop thinking about why, so i got up, switched the tv back on, loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the movie.<br /><br />well done alex frayne sir, you've managed to implant your film into this old, cynical movie goers head, and that takes doing. so 10 out of 10 to you.<br /><br />i can't say i 'love' this film of yours, but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc.
