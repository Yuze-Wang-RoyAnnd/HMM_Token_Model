a very good episode, although not as devastating a finale as the end of season 1. the idea to make it a desmond flashback worked very well, and henry ian cusick was fantastic, perhaps putting in the best performance of this entire series, but my only complaint would be the michael plot line felt very much like a subplot, and after three minutes the previous episode, i thought it would feature more. but the strength of cusicks character and performance pulled it through. the plot developments, as always, left more questions then answers, like who are the others, something we still don't know, and where are they taking jack, sawyer and kate. what was the white light, what impact has it had? are locke, eko and desmond dead? as the hatch destructed around them. if they are it would be a major mistake, because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and terry o'quinn has been fantastic throughout both series as locke. a fitting finale to a better series then the first.
