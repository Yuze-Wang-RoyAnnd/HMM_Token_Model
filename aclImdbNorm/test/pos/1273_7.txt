if christopher nolan had made memento before following, then all of the flaws in following would have been corrected. in memento, nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. we were able to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. however, nolan experimented with it a little, and it just doesn't work. although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is one way memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. on the dvd is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. i intended to write my review after watching it, so hopefully it would make more sense, but, of course, it wasn't working.<br /><br />you can't blame nolan for not coming up with original ideas. a young man, bill (jeremy theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow random people on the street. he finds one, cobb (alex haw), that particularly interests him. soon, bill becomes friends with cobb and goes with him as he breaks into houses and robs them. then, a saucy young blond (lucy russell) enters, and the movie becomes even weirder from there.<br /><br />the ending of following is one of the most shocking endings i've seen. sure, fight club had an amazing ending, but the way that following's ending played out was amazing. i felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion. nolan has a thing for making good endings (well, maybe not, i could guess insomnia's from a mile away), and can really construct a great story. following may not be the easiest to follow or look at, but it's such a finely crafted, original story with a shocker ending that you'll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again.<br /><br />my rating: 7/10<br /><br />rated r for language and some violence.
