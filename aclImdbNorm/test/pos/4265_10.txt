at times, the mainstream news media seems to be driven by a bunch of no-brain reporters. in that they just listen to each other and report what others report. <br /><br />this documentary shows what can be found if some more effort is put into the task of reporting about something. <br /><br />true journalism should be about providing the people with different perspectives on things that happen so that they have a fair chance of creating an own opinion. <br /><br />this documentary together with mainstream media reports, will help you with this. at least for me, it provided a lot of relevant information regarding the purpose/motivation behind the nowadays frequent world-wide protests at different political summits.
