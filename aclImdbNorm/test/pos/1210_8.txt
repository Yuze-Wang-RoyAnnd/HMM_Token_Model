this event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, i believe, is not equaled today. the colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. a kid could watch it without watching an episode of jerry springer.<br /><br />looking back now (i was 5 at the time), although i loved both warrior and hogan, i think i enjoyed warrior more because of his mystique. hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image. the ultimate warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man of few words - an out-of-the-limelight hero for a different audience.<br /><br />this rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this duality in me duking it out for each combatant. i had a place for both of them. because there was bloodshed too in this long, heavy battle, the stakes were high - at least to me as a kid. on a similar note, because of hogan's defeat, this made him more human - i remember feeling kind of sorry for him.<br /><br />all of these emotions at play in the juvenile boy's soap opera made wrestlemania vi such a great time to witness this game.
