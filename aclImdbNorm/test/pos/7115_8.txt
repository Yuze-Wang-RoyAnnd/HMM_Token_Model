this moody, creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea, a great setting, as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor (onslow stevens). the bat changes into a man known as baron latos, in reality count dracula (john carradine). he seeks dr. edelmann's help to cure him of his vampirism. eventually the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse-assistant (jane adams), the wolf man (lon chaney), and frankenstein's monster (glenn strange). but dracula's trickery contaminates the doctor's blood, and he becomes a jekyll/hyde vampire himself. this is somewhat better than the prior year's "house of frankenstein", being less episodic and more exciting visually. there's a haunting scene where dracula tries to lure the second nurse (martha o'driscoll) into his world, where she is initially playing "moonlight sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. director erle kenton uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features. two performers are of note: stevens, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then convincingly menacing. adams, her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. it all ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of 1940s universal horror, a little abrupt, with footage borrowed from "the ghost of frankenstein" (1942). i hope universal releases it soon on dvd (it was left out of their double-feature releases).
