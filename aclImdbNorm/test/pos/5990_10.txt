this movie came out about the same time as pretty woman. while the general theme is the same: wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman, the characters of romuald and juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them. i have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to pretty woman in so many ways. juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer. the final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. the efforts romuald makes to win the love of juliette surpass the puny climbing scene of pretty woman a hundred times over. see this movie, it will warm your heart.
