crackerjack is a hit and miss film set in the australian suburban lawn bowls club of cityside. mick molloy plays a scammer who has been scoring free parking spaces at cityside. when the club is put under pressure to install poker machines in it's premises they need to raise $8000 to keep this from happening. the club needs new members to help and this is where mick molloys character comes in and has to bowl to save the club. with many up and coming and aging australian actors crackerjack is a hidden gem. be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn bowls but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comical relief. sam johnson and judith lucy co-star. overall the movie should be recommended for people who play lawn bowls or have played but there is enough other material in there for an amusing play if you have a slight understanding. if you enjoy australian humour i suggest you get you're bowling whites on and head on out to the theatre because this is the premiere lawn bowls comedy of the year(also the only one).
