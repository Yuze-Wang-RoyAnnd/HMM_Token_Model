i was a huge fan of asterix comics when i was a kid and watched every one. i never heard about this movie when it was released but i watched it with my kids last night. i remembered the comic well enough to know that a lot was added to the story for the film. some of the changes i thought were a bit corny (like the nephew's 'modern' dancing, and the viking chief's daughter - almost everything about her), but i found most it amusing enough. most importantly, seeing the reactions as my kids watched it, confirmed that the film pleased its target audience. as a family film it works better than other asterix titles i've seen. many of the names that weren't in the book i found had the same appeal as ones that were. overall, an enjoyable family film, regardless of whether you're an asterix fan or not.
