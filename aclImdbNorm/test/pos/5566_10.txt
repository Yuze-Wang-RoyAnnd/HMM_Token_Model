this series is vastly underrated. like many others, i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled. bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, sci-fi. right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero - and every alien with whom he comes in contact - speaks english! okay, a few others have skirted the issue, but farscape did it the best. the point is, the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible.<br /><br />with so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series such as farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. while we enjoy the four seasons and, thankfully, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
