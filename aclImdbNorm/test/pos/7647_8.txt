this one surprised me.<br /><br />i read a few reviews beforehand that called it a good b-grade movie and was prepared for the worst. halfway through it i suddenly realised i was completely wrapped up in it and enjoying it a lot. there were some really tense moments that had you sitting forward fiddling nervously with the remote control or any other object in reach. overall this movie definitely doesn't deserve the b-grade tag.<br /><br />credit must be given to director, gary ellis and writers, bill boatman & todd king for their movie debut. i hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some studio backing.
