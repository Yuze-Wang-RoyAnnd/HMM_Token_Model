i found this one to be more chaotic than the average stooges short (as strange as that may sound). there were several funny bits, especially the running gags ("calling dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard!", the glass door breaking, the stooges running into the supply room and coming back out with... well, you know), but also quite of bit of it was taken up with things that just didn't make any sense to me. i have to assume that these were generally take-offs of scenes from the film "men in white", but since i don't know much about that movie i can't say for sure. maybe if someone could explain these i'd appreciate this short more.
