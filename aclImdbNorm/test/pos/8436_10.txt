this film is definetly fonda's best film. the plot is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the directing is amazing. an all time classic, this should have won best picture not kramer vs. kramer. though it was not even nominated. jack lemmon and micheal douglas are also at their best. one of the best endings ever. if you haven't seen this film run don't walk to rent it. should have been on afi's top 100. see it not just for fonda but for everything.<br /><br />**** out of **** 4 out of 4
