told in flashback, the film opens in 1989 with charlie being given award for his role in the defeat of communism. i must admit my heart sank as at the thought of have to endure yet another earnest, somewhat boring and overlong life story. how wrong was i, because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring.<br /><br />the film is full of entertaining & amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places. the next scene after the awards ceremony is charlie in a hot-tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a tv programme. another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film comprises charlie, a group of his rather sexy secretaries, phillip seymour hoffmans cia man and a bottle of whisky. as to dialogue what about this for a line, "the senator says, he can teach us to type but can't teach us to grow tits.". ok, school-boyish i know but the film is laced with great lines.<br /><br />as to performances well phillip seymour hoffman as usual steals every scene he's in. hanks is ok but surprisingly to me anyway was julia roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric texas oil millionairess.<br /><br />charlie wilson's war is one of the best non musician bio-pics in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains, amuses as well as informs all in equal measure.
