slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of des moines, iowa in which the rockers wear their own distinguished mask (i know someone already said this, but i need to fill up space for this review). the band members are joey, mick, 133, sid, clown, james, corey, chris, and paul. this band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone that loves hardcore rock. another good movie is called "disasterpieces" which shows the band's performance at the london arena. the "my plague" video was shot there and is included on the dvd. the most kick ass song they made is also on there (sic). so if you love the band you need to see this and if you love heavy metal music then you have to hear this band.
