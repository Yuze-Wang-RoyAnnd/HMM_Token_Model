i loved the movie "northfork". i knew nothing about the movie before watching it. therefore, i had no outside influence or information to guide me in what i was seeing unfold on the screen. in retrospect i would advise anyone interested in the movie to watch it if for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it. do not read anything about the plot, story line, or evaluation of the movie. in fact stop reading anything further in my comments although i believe they are general and would not spoil the movie for you, i don't want to diminish the value of the movie to you. find your own path of meaning in this film or it is diminished in its potential.<br /><br />in general, i found the 3 benign strangers in northfolk puzzling. as the movie unfolds, they could qualify as three entertaining escapees from a mental hospital or, the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy, or three angels "sent" to find the "lost angel".<br /><br />the sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three "strangers" to abandon the search for the lost angel, become his guardians (mother & father), and take him safely far away from northfork (no less than 1000 miles). he even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian. only one of the three responds to the boy on a positive basis. the other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement.<br /><br />the priest who is nursing the sick boy demonstrates a depth of caring for people and a deep conviction toward his faith. he transcends the desolation and emptiness of northfork and its people; he is the light of goodness and hope to both northfork and to the movie viewer.<br /><br />near the climax of the movie, the boy and new guardian journey over land to a field where a plane waits. they board to find the other two strangers also on the plane; in fact one is the pilot. the engines start and the plane takes off.<br /><br />who are the 3 strangers? if only one stranger was interested in helping the boy why were all three on the plane? where is the plane going? did the other two find the "lost angel"? is there a lost angel and if so who is it? who are the six men dressed like undertakers? if all of this is just the sick boy's feverish dreams, how did one of the 3 strangers end up reaching out to help one of the men dressed like an undertaker when he jumped and hit his head(neither the boy or strangers had contact with these men)?<br /><br />one or two sentences written under the title telling people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's statement about advertising only). so if you haven't seen the movie, northfork, the questions above show only a few of the interesting and fun forks in the road of thought when you view the film northfork. if you read the advertising summary of the plot of the movie before you watched it previously, maybe you ought to look at some of the questions above and watch it again... i know i will.<br /><br />terry
