i described woody allen's manhattan as perfect to someone the other day, and she thought that it was an odd way to describe a movie...<br /><br />i have seen only a handful of movies that i would call perfect. manhattan is one, mccabe & ms. miller by robert altman is another and once upon a time in the west by sergio leone is also another film that i think achieves perfection. there are a few others, but aside from the fact that i find no faults in the three i mentioned, i must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes.<br /><br />if there is one film that i could stand behind and bet the house that anyone i would show it to would find it flawless it's shoulder arms.<br /><br />city lights, the great dictator, the gold rush and even the pawnshop are 10's but not only did chaplin do everything right in this film, everything he did is hilarious and touching to a level beyond explanation.
