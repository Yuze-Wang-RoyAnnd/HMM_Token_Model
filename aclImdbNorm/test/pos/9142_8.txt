i already gave my comment on this movie under the name brucev3. now under brucev13 i want to add something! now after a long time i have seen a lot of so called heroic bloodshed titles! but not many come close to the action shown in john woo movies! that's why after all these years i think it is strange that "china white" doesn't get the credit it deserves! no matter what version you have seen! the action is top notch! the scenery,china town in amsterdam is very unique. you get the impression it is a large district. but having lived in amsterdam myself i know it is only a small area part of the red light district which happen to have a lot of chinese stores and restaurants! but because of the way they shot the movie it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know not to mess with the triads (chinese mafia)! besides the action "china white" is a compelling gangster drama with some good acting! for this i have to give credit to russel wong! too bad we don't see much of him lately,since he has a lot of potential! must see movie!
