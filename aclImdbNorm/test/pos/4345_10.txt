this movie is truly a classic 80s movie! a must have in any '80s' movie collection! guns, bad guys, creeps, gangs, charles bronson and more creeps!!!! <br /><br />in my opinion, this is the best death wish movie. tons of non-stop action! <br /><br />and keeping with the classic 80's "bad guy vs good guy" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and creeps! we see bronson mowing down thugs and creeps with a 30 caliber korean war heavy machine gun! a heavy machine gun for crying out loud! when charlie runs out of ammo for the heavy machine gun, he runs back to his crib and takes up arms with his long range high caliber pistol! this pistol can stop a freakin elephant and charlie is putting holes the size of hub caps into bad guys with it! and if that is not enough, charlie is also packing an anti tank grenade launcher, which by the way, is only good if he can get the creeps clumped together.<br /><br />the acting in this movie is "ha ha" great and a lot of off the wall actors (mainly playing creeps) appear throughout the movie! the film is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes! heck, my favorite scene/line is where the creep leader confronts broson in jail and calmly explains to him: "tell you what i am going to do ...i'm gonna kill a little old lady ...just for you! ...catch it on the six o'clock news".<br /><br />is this film violent? heck yes! but, you'll laugh and cringe all the way through!!!!
