what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said hundreds of times before? it's an american classic. it has spawned dozens of imitators. or none. midnight madness is one of kind. from the ridiculous opening montage/music to the bonaventure hotel, i was hooked. leon made us all feel so young and carefree. one question though, how did he have those two hot hookers with him all the time? and how did have the time/money to arrange such an event? the cast is top notch. david naughton is at his best here. his tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. his little brother michael j fox(in his first starring role), is a real brat. there is also naughton's love interest and a dork and the obligatory black dude in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. michael j fox does bad things like try and steal cups of beer at the pabst blue ribbon brewery and runs away to flounder's van. flounder's team gives us the most comedy. what exactly is the deal with the blond on that team? is she dating flounder? or melio? or blade? yes, the mexican gentleman's name is blade. the other guy on the flounder team has the best lines of the movie, i won't pomp them here. the meat machine team is a bunch of drunks. my personal favorite is armpit. but the silent black man is great too. the other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians(two of which are 450 lb twins).<br /><br />you know the ending from the start. but that doesn't matter. this is the 80's me-genre at its finest. don't rent this one, buy it. and buy it now.
