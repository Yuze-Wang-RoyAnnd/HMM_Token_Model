i just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is. just<br /><br />the memory of this movie right now enchants me. if you want to<br /><br />see a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vivid<br /><br />scenery, with great dialogue, reminding you of what early america<br /><br />could have been like [what the world could have been like back<br /><br />then]...well...i highly recommend this movie. especially during a<br /><br />time of war and conflict in iraq...when our american image is not at<br /><br />all what it used to be...this movie takes you back to a time when we<br /><br />were just starting out. when being an american meant really<br /><br />picking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going. when<br /><br />the world was such an untamed and unknown place. well, this<br /><br />movie has that...and more. enjoy.
