many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining and memorable. the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. this film follows three friends (gary, rick and david "the big apple") misadventures into the world of first-time sex and true love. along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. we follow hopeless romantic gary (the main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it's ending. if you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look...sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. l.a.v. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it's genre.
