i just recently bought "the big trail" {1930}. it's an awesome, amazing film. i knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent. my version is the one shot in 35mm and i'll speak of that again later. when one thinks of the western myth in film the names that come to mind are john ford and john wayne. well, you have only half the team here, but the entire myth is present. raoul walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the westward expansion of the nation. <br /><br />there is a plot centering on a romance between breck coleman {wayne} and ruth cameron {margaret churchill} with the main villain, red flack being memorably played by tyrone power, sr. but this has an almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against incredible obstacles
