this film brought me to tears. i have to say, that if i did not have a beautiful husband at home, i would ask this beautiful piece of art to marry me. aaron carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while timothy barton writes quick and witty dialogue that only furthers the genius of carter's performance. kyle is pretty gay, but his performance was nothing less than spectacular. he is also very handsome and cute. i'm thinking about asking him out on a date and giving him a very sweet goodnight gift.;)<br /><br />if you would like to discuss this film in the future, please contact me.<br /><br />nick burrell vassar class of 2012 malibu, california malibu west 310 924 0126
