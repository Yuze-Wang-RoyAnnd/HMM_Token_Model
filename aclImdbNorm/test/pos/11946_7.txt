i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young. it was one of those films that home box office showed every other day throughout my youth. this film is forever lodged in my brain. for someone who didn't grow up around this film, you may have become spoiled by the add cycle we've been in since the mid-90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem. cool this is, as my sis was doped up on "better off dead" before i saw this (of which i raped & loved)-and no one, no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in american cinema in the 80's - this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies..because with all the overuse of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new tech. i wonder if cinema will go back to these roots... this is the teen comedy...yes!
