i think that vanessa marcil is the best actor in the cast. she makes sam one of the best character on the show. james cann is also pretty good. i love it when he worried about delinda. one of my favorite scenes in when ed and delinda are beating the crap out of some guy. that was funny. nikki cox is also good and she has great chemistry with josh duhamel. lara flynn boyle was awesome in her guest role. i wish they hadn't killed her off. the show has a great cast with no bad actors which isn't something you often see on tv. i still think vanessa marcil is the best though. she should have got an emmy in my opinion. it's a shame the show was cancelled
