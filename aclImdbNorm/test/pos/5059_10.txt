we start all of our reviews with the following information. my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want. the point of this is that critics count for zero. your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me. the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! we never ever listen or read the critics. we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. well enough about that. <br /><br />when meryl streep the head of the nsc in the movie says "the united states does not torture" it got a big laugh at this movie. it is of course a lie that the bush administration has denied time and again. it is a very good movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights. they can simply "snatch" you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it. in this case, they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. he is of course just like you or i. and so they take him to a secret location outside of the us to torture and waterboard him. <br /><br />very frightening. well acted by jake and reese and the entire cast.
