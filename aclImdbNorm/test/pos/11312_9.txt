this movie was a riot, it pokes fun of "madonna - truth or dare" in all the right places. i love madonna & i love julie brown. how could i ask for more..julie's spoof of "vogue", entitled "vague" was hysterical.. "kelly lebrock thinks she's great, she's just cold boogers on a paper plate". "brooke shields, dawber, pam personality of spam"!! i could've died! and just wait till you see what she can do with a watermelon!!
