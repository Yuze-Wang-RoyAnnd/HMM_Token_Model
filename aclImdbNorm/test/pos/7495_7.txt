'thursday' is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality. if you have seen 'goodfellas', 'reservoir dogs', 'pulp fiction' and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from 'thursday'. there is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in tarantino's 'reservoir dogs'.<br /><br />still, it is a good movie. because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. the opening sequence to begin with, is quite impressive. we meet nick (aaron eckhart), dallas (paulina porizkova) and billy hill (james le gros). they get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop. we've already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in it.<br /><br />then we meet casey (thomas jane) in houston. he is married to christine (paula marshall) but used to be working with nick. she doesn't know a thing. then nick gives him a call and says that he is coming. we learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start.<br /><br />what happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters, all interested in the money or the drugs nick also had with him. casey has flushed those down the drain.<br /><br />very funny moments, a lot of blood, a very funny sub-plot involving actor michael jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it you see them coming) this is a good movie with some very fine performances, nicely directed by skip woods.
