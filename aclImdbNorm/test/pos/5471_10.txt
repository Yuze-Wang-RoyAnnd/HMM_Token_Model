i am from texas and my family vacationed a couple of years ago to sante fe with my brother. he suggested we go to see the church with the staircase. i was absolutely blown away by the miracles that took place there. the movie is great - barbara hershey and william petersen were perfect for the parts they played. it is amazing, absolutely amazing. if you have not seen the staircase in person, it is worth the trip to go see it. the wood is beautiful and the architecture is astounding. just being in the chapel gives me goose bumps! to read about the history of the chapel, and then to see its beauty is breathtaking. see the movie - it is great! then see the staircase in person!
