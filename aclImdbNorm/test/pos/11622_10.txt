i was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world. a hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world. for the most part the hispanic culture is shown as i have always observed and admired - hardworking, optimistic, and truly family oriented. the points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the catholic church. without a doubt,the actress who played the mother deserves an academy award. her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears. i will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family.
