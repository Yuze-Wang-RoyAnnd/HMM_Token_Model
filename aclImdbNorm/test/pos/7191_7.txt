in the original french version, the jokes of num'erobis (great, funny voice - jamel debbrouze) are very funny.<br /><br />but in translated versions (i saw the german & english version) it's not half good than the original.<br /><br />but: goof special effects, almost the full comic (with differences, like the figure of l"ugnix (german name) is placed in an other comic book.<br /><br />sure, the asterix comic book are cult, but when you watch the animated comic movies from 1968 to 1998 you will see much better jokes, better story and the old "charme" and "flair" of the cult stories.<br /><br />for french speaking people i suggest to watch it in it's original version, with or without subtitles, where available in different languages.
