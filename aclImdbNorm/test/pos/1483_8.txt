there was once someone in my family (not saying who it is because of personal reasons) who thinks that mr bean is always so silly in whatever he does on the comedy series. imagine how i felt at that time. shocked instantly.<br /><br />there are more reasons than one why i love watching mr bean. being one of those earliest shows on the local television here in my country where i first grew up watching, it's just one of those things which had stuck into my head. there was even once my friends and i talked about few of the selected episodes and we just laughed together.<br /><br />it's always silly, funny and hilarious in whatever antics rowan atkinson as mr bean will do in each episode. though lately at times it may show some of the repeats here, it never failed to bring back those childhood memories of mine. in fact, i can dare say this is the very first show which introduces me about the kind of shows which come out of the uk as i was growing up.<br /><br />the comedy series...definitely really wicked, as what the brits may be saying.
