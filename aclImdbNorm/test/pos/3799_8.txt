i saw this movie on late night tv out of buffalo about 30 years ago and i'm dying to see it again one more time before i... well.. you know. the interaction between the main characters after the tiger (eli wallach) "captures" his prey (anne jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. charles nelson reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. how many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? this film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class, race, sex or religion. and who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn!
