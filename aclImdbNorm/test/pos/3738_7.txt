eichard gere & diane lane back again in another romantic love story. they are an excellent team,but somehow this film will not be among there best, <br /><br />the director george wolfe using a screenplay by ann peacock & john romanao, for nicholas sparks novel, does a capable job. this is yet another tale of 2 strangers meeting & falling in love,then they go on there way,then when they are about to meet again & start a life together.<br /><br />spoiler but not really. tragedy happens, one of them dies.<br /><br />how many times have we seen this already.<br /><br />those who never saw tearjerkers like this will hopefully like it more than i did. this story has about every clich'e there is.<br /><br />the only reason this has the ratings i will give it. is because of the fine acting & excellent production . the cast besides our 2 stars, includes christopher meloni, viola davis & scott glenn. they all give real good performances & do the very best with the material they were given<br /><br />there is a good but not over done storm sequence, the sex scenes are well done, no nudity & next to no foul language,<br /><br />ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) imdb 7 out of 10)
