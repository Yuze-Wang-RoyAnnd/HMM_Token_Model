i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it. i believe jeremy brett is brilliant in this role although his "death" acting was a little over the top, but as its jeremy brett i didn't mind.<br /><br />this is a good piece of drama and does follow oscar wildes novel very closely. if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch "an ideal husband" with jeremy brett as lord goring.<br /><br />this film gives a great insight into oscar wildes way of thinking.and while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way dorian grey is lord alfred 'bosie' douglas and basil halward is oscar wilde.
