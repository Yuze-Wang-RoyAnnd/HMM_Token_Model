at first sight the bothersome man seems like several other movies/books rolled into one. kafka's the trial, melville's bartleby, the fall and rise of reginald perrin and groundhog day instantly spring to mind. a man, andreas, arrives in a nameless city where he is immediately given a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. however, there's a catch: his colleagues are all friendly, bland and utterly characterless, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation -interior design. welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow, or spend their days reading furniture catalogues and eating food that tastes of nothing.<br /><br />andreas quickly realises his predicament and spends the rest of the film trying to escape, in various ways. suicide turns out not to be an option, and when he finds a new girlfriend she is just as bereft of feelings as the old one - there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all she can say is, 'i don't mind'.<br /><br />in fact, much of what the bothersome man has to say has been said before, and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of deja vu. yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating, over and over again: an unexamined life is one that is not worth living. added to which, it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls. more than one character reminded me of people i've known, especially his furniture-obsessed girlfriend, and if by the end of the film the film-makers have run out of ideas, maybe that's the point - there will no end unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation.
