this is the best of the films (so far) that christopher guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast. previously, they'd made the excellent waiting for guffman and following best in show, they made the very enjoyable a mighty wind. as for their latest, for your consideration, the less said the better.<br /><br />the film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. you follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious "mayflower kennel club". however, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. amazingly, even though the characters are rather outlandish, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago i had some experience with dog shows and this is a very cutthroat group of people! my favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. i also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. however, the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from fred willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. his comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person--how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess. the other contestants featured were also quite funny--the high-priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner, the country boy and his hound as well as winkie's "parents" who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.<br /><br />despite the improvised style of film making, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story--one that is not for dog owners only. exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. clever and consistently funny.<br /><br />by the way, try to find this on dvd as the extras were actually worth seeing. while a bit painful to watch, i loved seeing harlan pepper and his beach ball collection in particular!
