walking with dinosaurs is an amazing documentary, educational for both the ignorant of dinosaurs and dinosaur-lovers (like myself) alike. i admit, i was very young when i saw this on discovery, but i was obsessed with it immediately. (spoliers!!!!!) the series contains 6 episodes, going from the late triassic when dinosaurs were just first evolving to the late cretaceous, at the end of reign of the dinosaurs. when i first saw this film, it was like i really had traveled back in time. the majesty of the diplodocus, the adventures of opthalmosaurus, and the caring mother version of t-rex all astounded my family and me. it is an amazing film, and i believe that bbc managed to do just what they set out to do. awesome job!
