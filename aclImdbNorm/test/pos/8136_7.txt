no this is not an ed wood movie. "angora love" is stan laurel's and oliver hardy's last silent movie. the end of an era! in the '20's laurel & hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly, this present day.<br /><br />it's a shame that this movie is however not among their best.<br /><br />the premise of the movie sounds good and is good. the boys team up with a goat this time, which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch. it however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat. most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable. the comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable.<br /><br />of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent laurel & hardy entry.<br /><br />7/10
