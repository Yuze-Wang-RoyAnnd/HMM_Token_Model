susie q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. it's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. at first, i thought the movie would be the clich'e cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was i wrong. it made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. i loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!! i recommend it highly to anyone, and the movie is family oriented, so you won't have to worry about unsuitable content. truly, if disney would show more movies that are up to par as susie q., it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world. now if only disney would show it just one more time!^_^ go susie q.!!
