i'd never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael elliott's enthusiastic review; in fact, after having read it, i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental outlet and it was (albeit a german edition i.e. sans the r1 extras), so i opted to check the film out immediately.<br /><br />while i wouldn't go so far as to give it full marks
