there is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. and it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. at the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.<br /><br />i saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. i went because i like science-fiction and wanted to see a "space" movie. remember this film was made before the first moon landing.<br /><br />there we sat, waiting for it to begin. but, surprise! there was no cartoon, no coming attractions. the theater owner at the cooper theatre for some reason chose to play "the star-spangled banner" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. then the theatre went completely dark and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.<br /><br />the overture ended and my seat began to vibrate as the blue screen with the mgm lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing "also sprach zarathustra" for the first time in my life. the ride had just begun.<br /><br />(i highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a dark room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect i felt in that theatre.) of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. intermission came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.<br /><br />i saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. i might have been "high" once but i didn't go to see it again and again because i was "tripping". i went because i knew i was seeing a work of art. it was so damn beautiful; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for hal turning to terror. and of, course, wtf was kubrick really trying to get across to me? years and years and many more viewings later, i understand it as well, i think, as i ever will. read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find "explanations", that's not my purpose in writing these comments.<br /><br />what i hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, gayne ballet suite or the blue danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that are there. and then draw your own conclusions. stanley kubrick wanted to share some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.<br /><br />if that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. if you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.<br /><br />but if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.
