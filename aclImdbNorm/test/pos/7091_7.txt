i wonder sometimes if maybe meryl streep has become so accepted as the most impressive, versatile actress since, well, maybe just about the beginning of the sound era that maybe her talent is now taken for granted. there are probably about three tics that she relies on consistently throughout her performances (most noticeably a pinched lip), but other than that, her performances are amazingly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal workings. even though "sophie's choice" and "a cry in the dark" and "silkwood" may be showier, her work here and in "bridges in madison county" is remarkable, too - just more subtle. in "one true thing", she is mostly sweet and in love with her domesticated life, and streep makes what could be routine, even boring, seem attractive and charming. i think that she must work out these mini-theses for each character and find what things make this person real and interesting. she works from the inside out with each character, and maybe it's this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of aloofness or self-consciousness. i don't think she's cold at all, but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities. i think her critics are confusing self-consciousness with intelligence. not too many other actors would be so complexly thoughtful and creative as to make kate muldrun lightweight and carefree within her beloved, homey environment, only to later reveal unprecedented depth because of her genuine attachment to that homey environment. her performances are of an unsurpassed consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. i wonder if it's conceivable for any of streep's pictures to not seem diminished because of her presence... anyway, kate loves her home, and her affection for her "family life" is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is jarring. when all of this comes together, and kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie dish and screams out that she is not handicapped, it is painfully sad to watch because this has not been someone prone to emotion. streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt out the dramatic validity of kate and it's really the only scene when she allows her character to go. but how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you wouldn't have thought possible. once again, streep's character has at least three dimensions... god, this sounds like a thesis itself, but as an actress, streep just has a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and great expressive skills. the movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre. i suppose william hurt is meant to be an unlikeable jerk, and he does pompousness very well. i think hurt is really kind of creepy, though. script is quite standard - another tribute to streep that she was as touching and believable as she was.
