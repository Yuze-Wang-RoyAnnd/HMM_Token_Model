don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. it has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking bugs, and some nice music. and the standout scene was definitely elmer, bugs and daffy's dance on the floor, that was such a nice and fun touch. as a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what i call exceptional like carrotblanca. there are some very nice gags, but they have been used before i feel, and there wasn't much that i would deem hilarious. and daffy joining forces with elmer? somehow seeing as he was a target of the hunter, didn't it seem odd that he would be friends with him. though i will admit it was nice having daffy there. the voice acting was above average too, but somehow i missed mel blanc.<br /><br />all in all, unexceptional but very nice cartoon. 7/10 bethany cox
