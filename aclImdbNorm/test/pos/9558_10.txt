in this offering, one only has to view the current westminster kennel club's annual offering to see the parallels. outrageously funny and captures the true essence of the competition. one can only imagine the wit of the producers and the amazing ability of the performers. i too would have nominated this movie for a globe award and feel it is one of the funniest i have ever seen.
