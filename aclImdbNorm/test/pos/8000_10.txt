it's been said that batman begins in the first batman movie to "get it right" but i think that's a horrible overstatement, for i think the new batman film, although greater that batman forever and batman and robin, pales compared to tim burton's classics, with this one being the best of the five. the darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a gotham city cloaked in mystery, unlike batman begins, where gotham city is a normal-looking city. the villains are terrific in this movie. you literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. i applaud tim burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old batman tv show. in batman begins we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. the film doesn't need to focus only on batman, because we already know his story, and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of gotham, a task he fails. danny devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film, surpassing even nicholson's joker. the closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. it's a tragedy that tim burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy, since warner bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" the batman movies up. and they got their wish...unfortunately. tim burton planned on directing the third film, using the riddler as the villain, with no two-face and robin to mess it up, and i'm sure michael keaton would've signed on. so this is the last great batman film. batman begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with lackluster villains, and a playboy bruce wayne. a decent batman film, but the best batman film ever? never. batman returns holds that crown.
