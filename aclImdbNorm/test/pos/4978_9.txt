i really enjoyed this movie. i have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for an eye', and this movie delivers that in spades. glenn ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make up his mind about selling'. when the ranch hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, cautioning his men to not take things into their own hands. but, that's just what he is about to do. i knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy (richard jaeckel, one of my very favorite bad-guy character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange of dialog with him, glenn ford slaps his face and shoots him dead. kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. in short order we're treated to ford letting his ranch be burned, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch; then ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch; then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground. talk about getting even big-time. lots of action in this movie. there's more to the story than this, but i'll just recommend you watch the movie. glenn ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and i really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way.
