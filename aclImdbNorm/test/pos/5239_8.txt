i really liked this film.it features john wayne in his first starring performance.even then,you can tell wayne has a real presence,although he wouldn't really mature into the icon he is known for until stagecoach,9 years later in 1939.it's about settlers from all over the country heading to the new west to colonize it.wayne's character breck coleman joins up,but for his own personal reasons.most of the main actors were stage actors and had never done a film before,which makes the movie even more amazing.they managed to create believable,distinctive characters and there is quite an oddball mix here.cimarron would come out a year later,and had a very similar story,though i didn't like it as much as this movie.for me,the big trail is a strong 8/10.
