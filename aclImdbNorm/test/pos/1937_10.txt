this is a forgotten classic of a film, and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for "gummo". gummo is good, river's edge is way, way better. its no secret that keanu reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth. no, in fact, he's a horrendous actor. but, he was born for some roles: ted preston, esquire from bill and ted, and his role in this film. he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. then there's crispin glover. i think his performance in this film is the best of his career. he is phenomenal as the drugged out wackjob character. then there's dennis hopper, who is perfect as well. this movie is simply amazing, and if you haven't seen it, run out and watch it today. its brilliant. one of the best portrayals of modern america i've seen.
