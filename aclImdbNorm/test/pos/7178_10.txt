a film of high intelligence and activity. as well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60's, the film is also truly a surprise in its forward-thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group. william greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group. he asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming. first the two actors, then the crew filming the actors, then the entire set including bystanders, policemen, and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in central park for 9 weeks.<br /><br />greaves edits the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations. don't expect to be bored by this film. each of crew make for engaging conversationalists and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film. greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized three-in-one pictures and other attention shifting methods.<br /><br />in the end, the film will really only be effective if it's what you're looking for: if you're looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own self-indulgent ego while never having a point, look elsewhere. if you're looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that comes of it, then this is the perfect film.
