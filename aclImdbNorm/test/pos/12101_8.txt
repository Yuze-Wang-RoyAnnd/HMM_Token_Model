faith akin has made me realize once more the deepness of my passion for this city called istanbul. being addressed as a city of cultural mosaics, faith akin has contributed to that addressing through the mosaics of music performed in the film. what's more, the climax of the film,in my opinion, is the scene where muzeyyen senar (a turkish music diva) sings at age 86 as well as she had done in her younger years and rolls the raki glass in the air without pouring out one drop, which is a traditional act in raki culture. she is just marvellous. sezen aksu (a turkish pop singer) with her mystical and meaningful looks at the end of her song which gives the film its turkish title makes the scene no less than a climax. last but not least, the wonderful scenery of istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are away. beware!
