this was eisenstein's first completed project in over ten years. the film takes place in the 13th century during an invasion of russian by germans (teutonic knights - i think). released in 1938 its a very loose parallel to russia's nearing involvement in wwii, and germany's advancement into eastern europe. there are some incredible scenes, most notable the battle near the end of the film, and there is a shocker when children are thrown into a pit of fire, but its not an easy watch. the film drags and isn't as consistently brilliant as "potemkin" or "ivan the terrible". sometimes eisenstein is better in clips. his brilliance is present, however, and its a "must see" for eisenstein fans and film historians. russian propaganda at its finest.
