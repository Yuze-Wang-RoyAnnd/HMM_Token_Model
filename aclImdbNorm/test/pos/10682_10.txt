gerry anderson's first live-action foray in the way of a major motion picture that benefits from incredible model fx work and,a great barry gray music score. the reel-to-reel analog computers, in the far-off year "2069" (i guess anderson really wanted a safe date of a 100 years later!) are a hoot to see as are the guru-jacket fashions, but one could easily accuse 2001 of the same violations, but no one could have foreseen some things as they turn out. this film was the springboard for the series ufo the following year, and in fact not only had the same fx people, and producers but many of the cast were regulars in that show.<br /><br />it always comes off like an "alternate history" future more than anything else-the "apollo-like" rocket used in the lift-off, it always seems like this is really another planet than earth. given the "alternate earth" plot, one would assume that was the feeling they wanted. we end up with an ending that posits more questions than answers. that because the "other earth" exists every movement, event and thing said is duplicated as it's happening on both worlds. because of that given, and the sun in between, the two versions of the same person (in this case glenn ross, astronaut) can never meet. a complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it would have most likely stayed a secret forever.<br /><br />filmed mostly in portugal with fx work in england, it's a must-own for any gerry anderson fan. i have the image bare bones dvd from a few years ago now out of print, but one hopes universal will re-release it with, perhaps extras and even a gerry anderson commentary.
