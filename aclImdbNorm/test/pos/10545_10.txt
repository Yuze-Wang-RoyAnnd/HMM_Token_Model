i can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever!!! if you are in the mood for a comedy, i totally recommend this movie! so, here's the summary. there is this girl(nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father(andre) whom she hasn't seen for about two years. she expects the vacation to be totally boring, until she meets this boy(ben), who is much older than she is. so, to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father, but her lover. this is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and i highly suggest it. so rent it and enjoy!!!
