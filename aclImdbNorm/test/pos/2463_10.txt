one of my desires is to be a film-maker, and i just have to say there's no way i will be able to compete with the powerful drama the war at home. the reason is because the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what i'm talking about. all i can suggest is watching it, i got so involved in it and was extremely impressed.<br /><br />estevez's and sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing.<br /><br />and so was his relationship with his mother (kathy bates). some of the best scenes include these 2. <br /><br />as well as the relationship between sheen and his daughter, estevez's sister in the film.<br /><br />10/10, and definitely in my top 10. i want the dvd!
