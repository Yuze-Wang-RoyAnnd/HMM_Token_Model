this isn't among my favorite hitchcock films, though i must admit it's still pretty good. among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary looking assassin (who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him). although it cost the studio a lot of money, i didn't particularly care for doris day in the film--she seemed to weep a lot and belts out "que sera" like a fullback. yes, i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner, but this forever made me hate this song. sorry.<br /><br />the other complaint, though minor, i had about the movie was that it was a little "too polished" and "hollywood-esque". the original version (also done by hitchcock) just seemed a lot grittier and seedier--and this added to the scary ambiance.
