when commenting on this film, one must realise that it is based on a true story, and must therefore be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of it's portrayal of the events, as well as its entertainment value. it may well be implausible that jack shepherd should surrender twice to jack wild because wild had captured edgeworth bess. none the less, it happened. it must also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied upon tried and tested techniques. there were occasions when clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script as written. the film would be better if he had. and yes, i used to have a copy of the script (stanley baker's copy - one of five), which i returned recently to my father, rafe newhouse, the writer.
