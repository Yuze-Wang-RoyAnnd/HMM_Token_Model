am glad that i am not the only one to find this series very good. this is the best series for young ladies! i have so strange taste on comedies and i find so hard one to please my intelligence, and i am so happy that their humor is exactly what i need. love the gang of actors! if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one, i say pretty please write back because i miss the series.<br /><br />and kindly ask the writers and the producers to continue it, even if the actors are now all grown up, i guess!<br /><br />have a nice morning/day/evening/night! (because i do not know the exact time you will be reading this post)
