this is a clever and entertaining film about the backroom battling that went on to choose a successor to johnny carson on the tonight show. however, the movie's ultimate thesis, that david letterman's superior comedic talents were overlooked because of his controversial nature, and the show diminished by the enthronement of an inferior jay leno in the leading comedy program on television is simply untrue, as anyone who has watched both leno and letterman perform can see for themselves. the hard and simple truth is exactly as one nbc exec stated in the film "jay leno is the funniest man in america." and david letterman is not. once you realize this, then much of the machinations in the film become irrelevant. ultimately, the whole film amounts to little more than sour grapes by letterman fans, who just cannot accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kind of things. the final proof is that despite letterman's early lead, possibly because of the hype that emerged from the battle for tonight show succession, leno's show has consistently proved to be the more popular, thus, in my mind at least, refuting letterman's claims to be unfairly robbed of his rightful inheritance.
