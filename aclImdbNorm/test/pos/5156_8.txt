you can't really call roy andersson prolific, (6 films in 37 years). nor can you accuse him of being conventional; he doesn't do 'straight-forward', at least when it comes to narrative. "you, the living", his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed doing nothing very much and if that sounds off-putting, let me assure you it isn't. this is a funny, accessible and surprisingly warm-hearted movie, a slice-of-life far removed from that which we normally see on the screen.<br /><br />of course, 'slice-of-life' is hardly the proper moniker to apply to this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be anything like this. the incidents on the screen run the gamut from the almost terrifyingly ordinary to the downright wacky and while characters may flit by, sometimes never to be seen again, others to reappear as if anxious for approval, andersson bestows on them all a kind of benign affection. that, and some rollicking music, ensure the time we spend with them is time well-spent.
