watching "cold mountain" gave me the impression that its director, anthony minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his' that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable "the english patient" from 1996. comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar. we have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again. the primary plot differences are that nicole kidman's character is not married, jude law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the american civil war.<br /><br />"cold mountain" is, story-wise, more watered down and mellow than say "the english patient" and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem. it is a shorter film, which is a plus for people with less patience. however, it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as "the english patient." my *only* big complaint about "cold mountain" is, astonishingly, the love affair between the characters of inman (jude law) and ada monroe (nicole kidman). amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. they don't have a real relationship; we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional. i was more fascinated by the friendship between nicole kidman and oscar-winner renee zellwegger and also jude law's travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. if minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story, then he would have had, i feel, a better picture.<br /><br />of course, the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting. the civil war sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. the re-enactment of the petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle is horrifying. minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner, and he's not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes. there are moments where women as well as men are killed, oftentimes by crossfire. and there's more to it. just the sound design of the movie generates tension. there's a scene where inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow. we don't see the slicing, but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening.<br /><br />lastly, i must congratulate the cast for the performances. jude law was terrific in the movie and deserved the academy award nomination he received. i feel that nicole kidman deserved one as well, even though her character was a bit shallow. renee zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. and then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in america's past.<br /><br />maybe "cold mountain" would have been better as a war picture, but it most certainly would have been spectacular like "the english patient" if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director anthony minghella. as it is, it's a most enjoyable picture, i wasn't bored by it, and i recommend it. i just say that its love story - though a central plot point - is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked.
