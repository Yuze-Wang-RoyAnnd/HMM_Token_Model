i have to rate this movie at a 10. i'm sorry but i think it's classic comedy. then, if you're rating it to other madonna movies...well, what? you wanna tell me it wasn't her best movie ever? didn't mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later? please, this movie deserves much more credit than it gets. plus, i like to think of it as an a+ sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80's. remember when you could shoplift from sam goody and cartier in the same day? remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly? so it was no "last emperor", it was still good. there are certain movies i'd be willing to watch everyday. three, actually, that pep up my day and make me smile. if you like "who's that girl?" then i'd also recommend "party girl" and "romy and michelle's high school reunion".
