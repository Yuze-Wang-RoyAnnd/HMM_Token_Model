this thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat. i saw it on video, some of the landscape at "the bluff" might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. cast has sandra bullock, ben chaplin (from "the truth about cats & dogs"), michael pitt (henry parker in "dawson's creek") and ryan gosling (???).
