the falcon and the snowman is a superb example of an anti-80s film. while many other films of the decade in general lacked substance, this film is pure substance. there's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. it boasts two superb performances: timothy hutton and sean penn as lifelong friends christopher boyce and daulton lee, respectively. hutton, penn, and tom cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things (all 3 starred in taps). while penn and cruise's popularity soared, hutton has been largely forgotten about, and that's a shame. actually, hutton is the first of the 3 to win an oscar for supporting role in ordinary people in 1980, but i think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding.<br /><br />hutton really captures the post-vietnam war rebelliousness in his character chris boyce. a failed seminary school student, chris has a love-hate relationship with his father, well played by the great character actor pat hingle. the scene where chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one.<br /><br />chris gets job at dept. of defense and uses his hatred of u.s. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the soviets. he gets his buddy daulton, a hyper drug-dealing self-server, in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. while chris is doing it based on his beliefs, daulton is doing it strictly for the money. the soviet liaison is excellently played by david suchet. penn and suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. but, make no mistake, this film is anything but that. it is a serious character study about pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust.<br /><br />again, the leads make this film. hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as chris, a rather smart young man who had so much potential. penn, as usual, does a tremendous characterization as daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks, and most of the time doesn't think at all. the ending of this fact-based film is very saddening on several levels. a truly powerful character study.
