i've been waiting for this movie for so many years! the best part is that it lives up to my visions! this is a must see for any tenacious d or true jack black fan. it's just so great to see jb, kg and lee on the big screen! it's not a true story, but who cares. the d is the greatest band on earth! i had the soundtrack to the movie last week and listened to it non-stop. to see the movie was pure bliss for me and my hubby. we've both met jack and kyle after 2 different tenacious d concerts and also saw them when they toured with weezer. we left that concert after the d was done playing. nobody can top their show! long live the d!!! :d
