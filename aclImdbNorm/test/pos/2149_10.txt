i saw this movie in santa monica on aug. 23 and it has stayed with me. i want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of harry's enigmatic, eccentric, life. and also for showing the flaws and failings of nilsson the man. thanks for showing the good and bad, the ups and downs, and for uncovering that amazing bbc footage. the film is also a great showcase of a vast amount of nilsson's music, really well placed throughout the film. i recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in harry nilsson or the music scene of the early 70's. some reviewer at the ain't it cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the santa barbara film festival, and i believe it. the film is informative, funny, sad, touching, and full of awesome music. it succeeds on all levels. really, really good.
