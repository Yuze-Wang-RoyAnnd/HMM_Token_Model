this film by the well-known czech director and writer collaborator petr jarchovsk'y is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details. taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old lucina (michaela mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic kuba (adam misik).the poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />marcela (anna geislerov'a), the beauty, and jarda (roman lukn'ar) have lost everything in the prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. there's no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. his car-thief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing benes (josef abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />"beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/on whom she can rely," begins the graves poem. but actually this fracas leads benes to marcela, when he meets her at the police station. he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany, where he, though prague-born, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. he's here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />in the circumstances marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, zdena (jana brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka (jiri schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. jiri schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. he is insistent that marcela needs to get out on her own, and when benes offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies. improbable--perhaps implausible. why should benes like him? but then, what is benes's whole story? about some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />clearly the "good angel," benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his italian upbringing. it's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over. <br /><br />also to be dealt with is jarda's religious fanatic mother sdena (jana brejchova), and her interactions with zdena and richard are something to watch. but she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by jarda and the car thief pal. if you revere hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. also included are a number of songs by glen hansard/marketa irglova of the oscar-award-winning irish musical film 'once,' including the latter's theme song, "falling." they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'once'--though this film came first.<br /><br />hrebejk's people are arresting; even little koba has his shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. the property hassle benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. but such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary. the acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. it's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to graves's poem that marcela still has hot sex with jarda during a revisit to prague after moving to tuscany with benes and her kids. but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of jarda's annoyingly pious mother (em'ilia v'as'aryov'a). how come all of a sudden we learn koba is getting letters from "india" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison? when did that come about? interesting details, hastily pasted in. this seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees.
