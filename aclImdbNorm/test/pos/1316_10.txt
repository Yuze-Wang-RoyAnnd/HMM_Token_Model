"mishima: a life in four chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. it is based on the life of controversial japanese author yukio mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. it is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. paul schrader makes you sympathize with mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. it doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it. an added bonus: as we see mishima's fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society, schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema. john bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. the grandiosity of composer philip glass' work is perfectly suited for the project. "mishima" is the best film i've seen this year, so far.
