dracula (john carradine) visits dr. edelman (onslow stevens) who believes everything can be cured by science. he wants edelamn to cure his vampirism--edelman agrees. then lawrence talbot (lon chaney jr.) pops up looking for a cure for his turning into a werewolf. thr frankenstein monster is discovered too but doesn't really do anything.<br /><br />very ambitious plot for a universal horror film from the 1940s. trying to cure the monsters by science is actually an interesting idea. also this movie has beautiful sets (love the castle to doctor lives in), tons of atmosphere, is very well-directed (great use of shadows) and has pretty good special effects.<br /><br />the acting is all good except for carradine--he tries but i could never accept him as dracula. also lionel atwill pops in playing (as always) the chief of police. this is pretty much forgotten and derided as a stupid film but i think it's very good. it's also to last time the universal monsters were done seriously--the next film was in 1948 in "abbott & costello meet frankenstein". it's a great film but the accent is more on comedy.<br /><br />the only real flaw here is there's a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: why does dracula try to bite lovely miliza (martha o'driscoll) when he's being cured? and why (and how) does the doctor get frankenstin into his castle? still these are small complaints. recommended.
