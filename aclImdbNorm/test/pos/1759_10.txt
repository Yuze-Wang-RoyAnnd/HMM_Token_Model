i first watched this in black and white, circa christmas in the early sixties, when it was shown on british television. i was absolutely hooked, and watched it over again whenever it was repeated on tv (possibly two or three times only, as it happens - if only we'd had video recorders then!).<br /><br />as outlined by other contributors, the plot describes the return of hoppity the grasshopper, after a period spent away, to a forties american city. he finds that all is not as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the 'lowlands' just outside the garden which belongs to a songwriter and his wife) are now under threat from the 'human ones', who are trampling through the broken down fence which prefaces the property, using it as a shortcut.<br /><br />insect houses are being flattened by their feet, and are also often burned by cast away cigar butts and matches. old mr bumble and his beautiful daughter honey (hoppity's childhood sweetheart) are in grave danger of losing their honey shop to this threat.<br /><br />to compound their problems, devious insect 'property magnate' c. bagley beetle has romantic designs on honey bee himself, and hopes, with the help of his henchmen swat the fly and smack the mosquito, to force bumble to give him her hand in marriage.<br /><br />will the heroic and fearless hoppity win the day, and manage to save the community of bugs from their dastardly fate, and especially his precious honey from hers? enjoy the classic songs ("katy did, katy didn't" is a superb, swinging, upbeat example), and the colourful visuals, as the tale unfolds.<br /><br />time has not blunted my fascination for this masterpiece of animation and story-telling, and i was much pleased to find that it had been released to video, although i later found out that it was in ntsc pal format. never mind, i sent off for the video immediately, and only then bought a portable tv/video combination (complete with ntsc playback).<br /><br />i have enjoyed many nostalgic viewings since then, and have even discovered that the tv rights have switched from bbc (who informed me they were unlikely to ever show the film on any of their stations) to filmfour, who have (at last!) been showing it on their digital stations in early 2007.<br /><br />my granddaughter (aged three) was absolutely entranced while we watched it together - and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer-generated productions!<br /><br />i would thoroughly recommend this film for any age, and especially the youngest of viewers.<br /><br />give max fleischer a posthumous oscar!
