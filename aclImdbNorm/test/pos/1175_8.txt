8/2008. when i originally wrote my comments, shortly after first seeing this film, i took a critical view, feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically "phoned-in" their performances, which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously.<br /><br />but upon seeing it again, it seemed different, especially in view that neither of the two main mega-stars lived a great deal longer after its release.<br /><br />with the exception of spiner, all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience, and likewise unavoidably a lot "longer in tooth" than we've seen in many of their other film and t.v. work. but isn't almost everyone?<br /><br />seeing it again, while it certainly won't be regarded as a "classis" in any of their careers, it is a fun film, with a lot of interesting scenery as well.<br /><br />from my viewpoint, it reminds me that many films, plays, etc., can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint, or looking instead to the lighter side, without expecting a film to be another "citizen kane," "casablance," or (in terms of the two leads), another original "odd couple." it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau, as well as the others in the cast.
