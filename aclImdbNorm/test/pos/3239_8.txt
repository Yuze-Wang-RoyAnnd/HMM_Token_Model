i can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but i can say that i enjoyed it. if there is a god, the sound track will be released, ilona sekacz' work is truly enduring. twenty years on i am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.<br /><br />the story surrounds the entry into society of catherine moreland. somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), catherine descends on bath in the company of mrs allen where she meets henry tilney. she is invited to visit the tilneys at northanger abbey, the seat of the formidable (and somewhat financially challenged) general tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth afoot.<br /><br />where mutual attraction mixes with family finance, dispute is inevitable. this coupled with catherines vivid imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. her eventual departure is marred by accusations and counter accusations of deception and connivance.<br /><br />but the attraction between catherine and henry stands these trials. he returns to provide a happy ending. this final scene is especially compelling, given the incidental music of ilona sekacz.<br /><br />it may well be a "bad" production from the purists viewpoint, gaudy costumes and shaky performances not withstanding, but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss.
