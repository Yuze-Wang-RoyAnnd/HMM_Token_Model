this movie is one of the most memorable films i have seen. i went reluctantly with a turkish friend who recommended it. i am not a very enthusiastic proponent of music documentaries, but when aynur dogan, a kurdish woman banned for years from singing in turkey, sings her piece, the theater was in awe. i would give my all to hear a cd recording of this haunting, gorgeous song. and she is just one of many artist interviewed and recorded, speaking of their experiences of performing in istanbul. even now, a month later, i remember the footage of aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium, and i try to remember the music as it echoed in the cinema. well done to faith akin, the director of this film, and his great idea to capture the many splendid sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. it would certainly encourage me to visit istanbul.
