i can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often i've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. i saw it the year it was released, i was 19. i don't think there were a dozen people in that east village theater that night. for years i thought we were the only ones who saw it. nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as i had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.
