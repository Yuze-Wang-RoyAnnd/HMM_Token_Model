okay...it's 2005 and when you finally get to look at this film, you will probably exclaim that it is dated. but here's the thing, the screenplay was bold, the exposure of the music industry at that time was as bold as well...and it took some time for this to get music that was created by african americans to be promoted on the same level as white acts. in some cases it still is - but back in the 70's this film addressed some of the "background" many never knew. now we've got "american idol" - "pop idol" and other such things that allow us into the minds of the "record execs" and how they think they should market something that sells and not market talent.<br /><br />when i was a kid, i loved the earth, wind and fire release of "that's the way of the world" which contained some of their biggest hits: "shining star", "reasons", "yeanin', learnin'" and the title. little did i know this was a soundtrack of a movie...until i moved to los angeles and got the wonderful "z" channel.<br /><br />the "z" channel showed this film as part of a "harvey keitel" retrospective. gee, i had no idea harvey keitel did so many movies -- and when i saw this one, i was surprised. this movie is not a cinematic masterpiece, but it does deserve more merit than it got. it's a nice little film. more than a "vanity piece" for earth, wind and fire, harvey keitel does a great job as a torn record executive trying "to fight the system". there are a lot of lessons to be drawn from this, and a lot of "insider" trade that was exposed.<br /><br />if you can find this uncut...it's worth a look.
