this version did not move me as deeply as the later, hollywood version starring anthony hopkins and debra winger. while it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted, the bbc version was more packed with dialog that imparted information which i found fascinating. it gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated c. s. lewis. it was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the hollywood version, but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally affecting. still, while i did not leave a heaping mound of sodden kleenex in the theater, i did use one, and at frequent intervals. i enjoyed this film every bit as much as the hollywood version, and was grateful for the increased understanding i gained.
