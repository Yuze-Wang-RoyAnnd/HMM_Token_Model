a girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral. soon, the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly. while i won't say that "uzumaki" was an excellent film, i will say that it was unlike anything i've seen before. throughout my viewing, i felt like i was watching a cartoon. there are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. later, i found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic, so this makes sense. however, just when you think you are watching something that could be a kid's movie, you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals! the story often lags and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti-climactic at the time, but in retrospect i appreciate it more for its originality. my rating: 7/10.
