always enjoyed "doa",1950,which starred edmond o'brien and was very curious about this film. dennis quaid,(dexter cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. dexter gets involved with meg ryan(sydney fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems! if you like dennis quaid and love meg ryan you will enjoy viewing this film, meg gave an outstanding performance and kept this picture worth watching!
