clint eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,wolfgang peterson, eastwood delivers as only he can.also,john malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.as for rene russo as clint's love interest,i think kirk douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,"i keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger".this film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.eastwood and peterson should team together more often. top notch movie.
