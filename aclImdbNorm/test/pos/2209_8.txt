at first i didn't think that the performance by lauren ambrose was anything but flaky, but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense. amy madigan seemed too terse for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together, even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by lauren ambrose.<br /><br />christopher lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line. his character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with <br /><br />the overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by taylor roberts. her comprehensive delivery of a simplistic character held the movie together. in this pivotal role, taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all of the other relationships in the film.
