" i have wrestled with death. it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. it takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary. if such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be." marlow in joseph conrad's "heart of darkness"<br /><br />it's difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art. yet movies have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legislated.
