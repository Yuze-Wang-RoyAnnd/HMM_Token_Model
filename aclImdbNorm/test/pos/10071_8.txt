i kid you not. yes, "who's that girl" has the distinction for being one in a string of madonna's films that bombed, but i actually liked this movie more than "desperately seeking susan". in "susan", madonna's character is relegated to being second-fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with. no disrespect to rosanna, but in wtg madonna plays this zany, outrageous character, only done in an 80s style. while it may seem "cheesy" today, this is actually one of madonna's best and one of her most underrated films.<br /><br />madonna plays nikki finn, an ex-con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn't commit. she's being released from jail after four years of good behavior. griffin dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays louden trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station. of course, when these two get together, that's when the madness happens. sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest(???) on his roof. <br /><br />this movie parodies everything. rich people, the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy louden's rolls-royce, the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town, and dunne's stuck-up fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city (played by haviland morris, who was jake's girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles). hilarious! plus, dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of "bringing up baby". plus, madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtg.<br /><br />madonna is the queen of deadpan acting. there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly, it turns out to be funny! that's how some of the best comedy should be played - straight. madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so. later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark, sexually-charged roles in the notorious movies "body of evidence" and "dangerous game". <br /><br />some people say madonna cannot act, and that is fine, people are entitled to their opinion, but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film, instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies. it's still a fun, screwball comedy of the 80s. not for everyone, i'm sure some of you will dislike it, so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and like it! <br /><br />interesting note: one of madonna's friends from her early-80s new york club days, coati mundi, who plays raoul, was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band.
