obviously, ponyo can be seen as just not another stupid animated movie that a studio might put out to simply survive. it is far from it, and it can be easily described as a captivating, beautiful movie experience.<br /><br />miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. now, to many, this has been said to be the least of his achievements in film-making, due to in part of his "certain weirdness factor" not being there. that is true-the morals and insights that are not quite so evident in his previous films are very up front in this picture. ponyo is not too difficult to understand or comprehend. his idea, i believe, was to make a children's movie that was just as suitable for adults as their kids, and for it not to be too complicated. he accomplished this perfectly, and he also didn't lose any substance along the way, which is the reason it gets a 10.<br /><br />besides that, the film itself is so engrossing from the start, and the way its presented is so beautiful, it left me in awe at times because i remembered how they were all hand-drawn by miyazaki himself. i haven't been so enlightened and happy after seeing a film since i saw once a while back (another film not to be missed). everything about ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even the music for it was pure perfection. the only bad thing i have to say about it was its english dubbing. don't get me wrong, they were good, too, but i had seen ponyo about 2 weeks before it came out nationally, and i believed that, in some parts, i wish it had kept some of its japanese dialogue (not all of it, though; did enjoy the "english way" too). all in all, everyone should see ponyo; it's absolutely flawless and in another league of film-making altogether. finally, and don't hold me to this, but i wouldn't be surprised if ponyo got a best picture nomination, as there are now 10 films that can be nominated for it. it's just that good.
