this film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world, perhaps even in english. hopefully nobody understood a word, not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways! haahaa! call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever. why would i come to that conclusion?? because it's my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute! once i became a fan of myster science theater 3000, i had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it. sure enough! the version they acquired was entitled "cave dwellers" using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself (apparently, they were ashamed to use footage from their own film!). i can't say i recommend buying this film. rather, i highly recommend getting the mst3k version. sure to find it most anywhere mst3k dvd's are sold, don't miss out!
