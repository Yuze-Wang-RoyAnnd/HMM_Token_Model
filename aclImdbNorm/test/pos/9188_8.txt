this was a movie that, at the end, i thought "now that was an enjoyable 2 hours!" i hate spending around $20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and myself to have that "it was ok" feeling.<br /><br />i think i like will smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero. he was well cast in this. his character was very likable, as was kevin james'. <br /><br />there were several laugh out loud scenes. it's also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to this. women will like it as much as any chick-flick, but i wouldn't categorize this as one. there is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. i think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. it has romance and slapstick. i don't usually like slapstick that much, but it wasn't overdone and i can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs.<br /><br />i definitely recommend this movie. the first thing my husband said to me after it was over was "i want to see it again!"
