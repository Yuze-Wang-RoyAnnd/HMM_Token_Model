"tourist trap" is a bizarre, great horror film from the '70s. the film is about a group of young adults, becky, jerry, and molly, who are traveling in a jeep through a desert area. their two other friends, eileen and her boyfriend woody, are in a separate car. when a wheel goes flat, woody takes it to a nearby gas station - and meets a grisly fate to some bizarre telekinetic mayhem and some creepy mannequins. the friends get tired of waiting for woody and go to a local "tourist trap" mannequin/wax museum. in front of the entrance, the car randomly breaks down, and the girls find an oasis area to go swimming in, where they are approached by mr. slausen, who runs the roadside attraction that is now closed down. he takes them up to the old western wax museum, and the girls stay behind while he and jerry go to fix their car. eileen, the curious of the two, wanders to an old house nearby, where she also falls to the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a bunch of life like mannequins. after awaiting for eileen, becky and molly go to look for her. that's when the real horror begins, and the telekinetic (can move objects with his mind) masked brother of mr. slausen begins to kill off the teens one by one, while controlling his large amount of human-turned mannequins.<br /><br />sound similar to the 2005 "house of wax" remake? well, it is. i'd heard of this movie but never seen it when i saw "house of wax", but now i can see the striking similarities the two movie share - "tourist trap" was obviously a big contributor to the "house of wax" remake. the mannequins in this movie are scary to begin with, some with moving eyeballs, some with no eyes at all, and some with dropping mouths that sing too. the singing was extremely creepy if you ask me, and the mannequins were eerily designed. mannequins are creepy to begin with, they're so lifelike yet they really aren't. the movie tightly blends elements from "texas chainsaw massacre" (the masks the killer uses are similar to those of leatherface), with a little bit of the original "house of wax", and the telekinetic powers that are displayed in "carrie". the result is quite satisfying. the telekinesis was a nice touch to the movie, it made the killer all the more menacing and inescapable. the masks were terrifying, and the plastering scene was really disturbing.<br /><br />the score for the film was really well done, if not a little overused during some scenes. the acting may not be particularly on key, but it really wasn't that bad. chuck connors was really good as the shadowy mr. slauston, giving the character a shady but friendly feel. a young tanya roberts is also in the film, she's most known for her role on "charlie's angels" and more recently the sitcom "that '70s show", playing donna's mother. robert a. burns serves as the art director, he did a phenomenal job on the original "texas chainsaw" and does a good job here as well, creating a cluttered, musty atmosphere to both the rundown museum and the old house filled with mannequins. i found it a little odd that the original rating for the film was pg, it seems a little too scary to have such a tame rating, but the film really isn't too violent.<br /><br />overall, "tourist trap" is an eerily unique, fast paced, extremely under-appreciated horror classic. full moon gave it a decent 20th anniversary dvd release, the commentary was interesting and the picture was clear and crisp for the most part, better than the video versions. if you enjoy older '70s slasher-horror films, "tourist trap" is an underrated retro gem. 8/10.
