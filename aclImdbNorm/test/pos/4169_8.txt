wow. this movie is the voice of a climbing generation. director sam keith takes us to the darkest depths of man's soul where we find love, life, and top-roping. world-weary telly (leo fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors through a cerebral journey to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic colorado. instead, telly meets confrontation in don (jason bortz), the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanities foibles. the epic film comes to a climbax at a gut-wrenching top-roping competition that will make even the strongest willed viewers squeamish at the dizzying heights.<br /><br />this movie has it all: top-roping outside, top-roping in the gym, cut-off shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, awesome climbing footage (some so good, you see it 2 or 3 times!), bear and snake attacks.<br /><br />i gave the movie 8 out of 10 because i wanted to see the romance develop a bit more. it seemed as if the film was leading up to a spicy, top-roped sex scene between telly and his new lover, but alas, it wouldn't fit into the already jam-packed hour and a half thrill ride.<br /><br />fans of cliffhanger and mission impossible ii will find this flick to be a diamond in the rough. overall, if you are ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing, this is the film for you!!!1
