i love this show. it's truly unique. i was under the impression it was going to have more seasons. in anticipation of series 2, recently i purchased series 1 to re-watch it in order to be refreshed when part 2 started. now after watching it i was excited and craving more, so i came to the site to see the schedule for the continuation. i am really disappointed to see there no longer are plans for a second series as i was eagerly looking forward to watching more of this story. i think they really dropped the ball on this one. there was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions. i'm now a very unhappy view and i hope that they would reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it left off.
