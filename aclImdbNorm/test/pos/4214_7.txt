jimmy wang yu, an authentic asian superstar, directed and wrote this film which i have only seen in a dubbed videotape version. the widescreen (shaw scope!)shape was lost and the original actor's voices absent but this is still good to watch. the story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of assorted thugs.<br /><br />the combat gets better as the film unravels. early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where wang yu fights hordes in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives, sword and fists. that part is very exciting.<br /><br />quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one.
