aunt cora had always been tactless, and her well-bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother richard's funeral: "he was murdered, wasn't he?". they remembered it the next day, when cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet...<br /><br />for some reason, the poirot movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book. i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table-- my favourite poirot book. after the funeral is my 2nd favourite poirot book, and i was scared the story would be destroyed. it wasn't! the movie was nearly page-for-page faithful throughout, right down to the killer's motive! all the actors were wonderful, but my favourite has got to be monica dolan, who gives a great performance as miss gilchrist, the companion to the late aunt cora. without a doubt the best poirot movie ever!
