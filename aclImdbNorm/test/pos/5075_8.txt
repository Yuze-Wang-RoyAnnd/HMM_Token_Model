most of this political thriller presented as a mostly run of the mill movie with a somewhat better development of many of the major characters, that was much appreciated, until the big twist and powerful climax that recalled twists experienced in "silence of the lambs," or "the sixth sense." reese witherspoon as the distraught wife of the missing egyptian husband and yigal naor as the strong-armed interrogator offer strong performances. jake gyllenhaal unfortunately is handed a more two-dimensional character and has to struggled with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn cia analyst that has been presented many times before in other movies. early on there is the nice scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of "saving private ryan," the silent scene that was used so effectively in reflecting one consequence of violence. the script also provides a little more glimpse into the mind-set of the "enemy" but still doesn't allow the audience really much understanding, again permitting the audience to wallow in stereotypical characterization. the cinematography and photography also is somewhat of a letdown because unlike "jarhead," or "blackhawk down," the crisp, raw visceral presentation is missing not allowing the audience to really be there in the movie, there is some distance that keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions occurring on the screen. however, overall, the movie redeems itself by the end, offering the audience a measured look into the complexity of the united states' use of rendition and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use. eight out of ten stars.
