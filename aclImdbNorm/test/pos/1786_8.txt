a year after her triumphant first special, "my name is barbra", barbra streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this follow-up cbs-tv special in then-revolutionary color. first broadcast in march 1966, "color me barbra" follows a similar format to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. the first takes place in the after-hours halls of the philadelphia museum of art where dressed as a period maid, she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song. in various guises, streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the "minute waltz" to the melodrama of "non c'est rien" in a modigliani painting to the beatnik-style frenzy of "gotta move" set to abstract art. my favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead ringer of queen nefertiti while singing a haunting rendition of rogers and hart's "where or when".<br /><br />opening with another comic monologue full of silly non-sequiturs, this time in french, the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly-colored circus medley where she interacts with animals, including her beloved poodle sadie. she finds an appropriate context for "sam, you made the pants too long" with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an anteater's with "we have so much in common". as with the first special, the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts, "any place i hang my hat is home", "where am i going?" and "starting here, starting now" among them. also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in all-white, when the special was first released on vhs. the juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special, and a 23-year old streisand is in peak form.
