this tough-to-see little picture played at the mods & rockers 2007 festival. it is a wonderful and loving look at harry nilsson, using many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen tv performances and behind-the-scenes footage of nilsson at work. there's even a few shots from "son of dracula". this movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices, the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. it's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and/or performed. his friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with a subconscious wish for self-destruction. as a bonus, you even get eric idle performing the song with wrote for nilsson's final album during the closing credits. it's funny, it's sad. it's not in general release. if this picture plays anywhere near where you live, see it!
