i've only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but i can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it. i thought it was an intelligent look into schooling, friendship, bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life.<br /><br />the title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if you're good at it- this is set in a private school in england but it could be anywhere.<br /><br />the main character is bad at games, seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch. i must admit i was gutted by the ending - it was powerful and saddening.
