drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending. basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment. some favorite parts of mine from this episode are mulder's dialogue in the car, and the scene where scully goes in with the hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus. the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when mulder arrives the man is already dead. 8/10
