the evil professor moriarty plots to gain control of both sherlock holmes and the secret weapon which could win the war for the nazis.<br /><br />basil rathbone & nigel bruce return to the screen as sir arthur conan doyle's beloved detective and sidekick, sherlock holmes & dr. watson, in this entertaining little mystery. universal studios wasted no money on either fancy production values or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need. indeed rathbone, as the cerebral ego, and bruce, as the bumbling id, seem to actually become the characters they are creating, gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most utter nonsense.<br /><br />dennis hoey makes his first appearance as the dogged inspector lestrade of scotland yard; teamed with bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior holmes' life twice. lionel atwill, a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a fine job as moriarty, making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of holmes' steel, relishing the scenes in which he gets to inflict torture & pain.<br /><br />william post jr. and kaaren verne play the swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery, but they're not given much to do. sweet mary gordon makes a token appearance as holmes' landlady mrs. hudson.<br /><br />rathbone spices up his already classic interpretation of holmes by getting to appear in disguise three times during the story, thereby revealing to the viewer that the great sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart.<br /><br />this film--which is based very loosely on elements in sir arthur's short stories 'the dancing men' and 'the empty house'--followed sherlock holmes and the voice of terror (1942) and preceded sherlock holmes in washington (1943).
