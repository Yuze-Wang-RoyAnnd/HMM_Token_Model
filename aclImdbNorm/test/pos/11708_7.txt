i was very impressed with the latest production from mick molloy. as a fan of his, i was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here. he wisely opted with a more subtle, broad style of comedy in crackerjack, rather than his usual low brow, in-your-face ramblings. it is, at times, inconsistent and un-even, but a decent script works past that, and makes for some entertaining viewing. directed by paul moloney (who has directed almost every australian tv series imaginable), crackerjack tells the story of jack simpson, a bloke that belongs to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking. when the club hits financial trouble, he is forced to bowl competitively in an attempt to raise the funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine haven. a familiar, and successful formula, that is handled well. there is no denying that the film owes it's success to the great casting of molloy. he seemed to have a great rapport with samuel johnson, and excellent chemistry with judith lucy, and while the character is probably not a far stretch from his own personality, you can't help but wonder why he hadn't tried his arm at film earlier. to smooth out the in-experienced cast, the delightful frank wilson and bill hunter support, and often steal their scenes. they are two fine actors and the pair cruise through their roles with ease. had it not been for the huge success of 'my big fat greek wedding', crackerjack would have made it to number 1 at the australian box office, but when you consider what he film is about and who is involved, even making it to number 2 was an outstanding effort. all in all, a witty, feel-good movie. great cast, great crew, and a great soundtrack, combine to make one of the better australian films of 2002. 7/10.
