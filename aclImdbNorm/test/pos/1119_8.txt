a good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. it's a horse racing movie, and it's a "little man gets his chance" movie, and it's a "how far would you go?" movie. walter mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. he fits right in as lloyd bourdelle, a louisiana cajun horse bum. this movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of lousiana cajun horse drag racing. he has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect. "had nothing but a filling station and a good horse." the bourdelles seize the opportunity to make it big by taking the horse, shadow, to ruidoso, new mexico, to get ready to run in the all-american futurity. but how far will lloyd go to win the fame and fortune? also memorable from this movie are scenes of lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for his truck to start.
