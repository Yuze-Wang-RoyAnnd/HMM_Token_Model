this film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill. this is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new american bomber. now much of this plot was repeated in other chan films, the jade mask and the docks of new orleans. additionally, it was first used in mr. wong, detective--all had the exploding glass globes--a plot element that obviously has been overused. it was interesting in murder over new york, but by these later films it was rather pass'e.<br /><br />fortunately, the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very well--with a nifty conclusion where, of course, the culprit reveals himself. however, no plane could fly the way this one did--especially in 1940. such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty silly out of this already obsolete plane.<br /><br />by the way, in a small role as a porter you'll see frank coghlan jr.--the same actor who played billy batson in the captain marvel serial. according to imdb, mr. coughlan is 93 years old and retired from the film industry.
