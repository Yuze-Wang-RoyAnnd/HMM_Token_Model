though the video technology may be dated, this classic musical play, now on dvd, is the best version of sondheim's most important and polished work on broadway. if you've never seen sweeney todd, then you must buy this dvd. i saw this production in november 1980 at kennedy center in washington--and fell in love with a pre-"murder she wrote" angela lansbury. subsequently, i tried to find any and all of her work, among them: movies: "the harvey girls," "the picture of dorian gray," "manchurian candidate"; cds: "mame," "dear world," and "gypsy"; and many more. the rest of the cast is flawless, too. all in all, this wonderful dvd gives us the definitive version of sondheim's opera!
