i didn't personally know karen carpenter, nor, richard for that matter, so i must go by how the movie portrayed her. i think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother richard. however, from what i did see and learn of karen, i felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. i know that i wasn't born until 1965 so i didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but i definitely grew up listening to her music and i have fond memories of her music. i remember the song about the "radio" (every sha la la la every whoa...so fine,) etc and i remember "we've only just begun! as a matter of fact, i memorized many, many of her songs and some people (quite a few) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her!!! ( i am not joking on this). i also used to be anorexic during high school and part of college (1978-1987) to be exact and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to eventually 120 pounds in 1987. i developed some pretty serious health problems from that which helped me to identify with the actress portraying karen in the movie. the mother (agnes) was very much like my mother in many ways and i could also feel the pain that karen must have experienced. for, my mother was often unfeeling, critical, and disapproving as agnes was (if this was true to accuracy). the movie was helpful in identifying and getting to know karen on a more personal note by not just hearing her music but by seeing what she was going through. it is quite difficult to portray a person's entire life in 2-3 hours and recount every single detail perfectly so i would have to say that there is probably no biography that is that accurate. i will give this story an 8 though! i wish i did know karen personally! i would have died to meet her!! i would have loved to have shook her hand, given her a hug, or talked to her. i feel her warmth and love every time i hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed.
