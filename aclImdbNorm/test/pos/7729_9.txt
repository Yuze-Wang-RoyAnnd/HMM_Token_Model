excellent movie in many aspects. vicente aranda has succeeded in depicting the time (1830) with meticulous care. the light, the places, the feeling, are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie. and along with it -in opposite to what happened to "mad love" (juana la loca), a rather episodic historical movie- all of this beautiful photography/ music/ clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way.<br /><br />concerning the actors, paz vega as carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, agressive, totally sexual, so beautiful carmen. sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen, but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie. i recommend it to everyone: the best spanish movie of the year.
