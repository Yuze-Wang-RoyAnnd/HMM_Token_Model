not for those adrenaline maniacs etc it's a good movie, looking at after war, psychical problem, from the other point of view. <br /><br />emilio estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of vietnam war, causing problem in family. <br /><br />marin sheen is also good as a conservative father.<br /><br />it all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past, with whom<br /><br />emilion estevez's character can't seem to deal, and martin sheen's character don't want do deal with.<br /><br />protective mother looks at this problem with warm , and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons.
