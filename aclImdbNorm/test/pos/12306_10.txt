john huston made many remarkable and memorable films. those most often and easily recalled were released long before his passing in 1987. it was that year, however, that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella "the dead." <br /><br />once long ago, a very wise man called doc asked me, "doesn't "the dead" seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in dubliners?" i tend to think that it is. the story and film both contain some of joyce's societal comments and criticisms, but for the most part, paint a warm and loving portrait of an ireland joyce himself so often railed against and would shortly leave. <br /><br />huston's handling of protagonist gabriel conroy, who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion, is simply remarkable. to claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point. as with any of joyce's dubliners, plot--while most certainly present--is not the focus. plot is merely a tool for the conveyance of the protagonist's epiphany. in addition to a seeming lack in action, there is quite frankly little dialogue in joyce's short story for the director to lean on. huston's ability to translate what joyce puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movie's greatest triumph. feelings, thoughts...gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal. <br /><br />to claim that huston has softened his writer's criticism of society again misses the mark. while "the dead" may be painted with a cheerful hue, the complacency and pretense of the film's characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale: we are the toddling old aunts; the embarrassing drunk; the tenor with the sore throat; the wife with the sad, rain soaked secret; even the self-deluded middle-aged man. <br /><br />but "the dead" belies its title. it is not a dark story. nor is it really that bleak. forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it; forget the shambles of a life gabriel awakes to at the film's end: it is only with the destruction of the illusions gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward. such is the central point of the film. such is the central point of our lives.
