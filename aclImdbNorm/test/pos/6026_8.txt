i came across the last stop one day at a video store and they were selling it for only $2. i decided to give it a try and bought it. it was pretty good, i enjoyed it. the story is about several people all caught in a cabin somewhere in nowhere because of a raging blizzard. there is a police officer, nancy,his ex girlfriend, two brothers that just got out of jail, a older man and his lover, a black man and the couple that owns the cabins and their retarted son that never speaks. suddenly someone is found to be murdered and a bag full of cash is found. everyone is a suspect. the last stop is a pretty good thriller, i would give it 8/10
