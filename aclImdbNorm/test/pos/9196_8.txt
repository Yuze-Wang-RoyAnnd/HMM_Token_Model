1st watched 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10(dir-jesus ponce): simple, sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures surviving in the everyday world without a roof over their heads. the movie starts with the woman in the story(played by isabel ampudia)being released from prison but we don't know what she was in for or how long she was there. she runs across the anti-hero of the story and her boyfriend, played by sebastian haro, as he's parking cars for change. they shack-up together underneath an old dilapidated building with nothing but each other's warmth and a small mattress to their possession. he is a drug addict who just tries to make it from one fix to another, but she has a strange, obsessive attraction to him as a person, which we eventually accept. he also has some sort of sexually-transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of the question but this doesn't appear to be a problem for either of them. she loves this man as he is, without question, and without him having to change, which is a rare find anywhere. she earns her keep by carrying a bucket around and washing shop windows. they eat a bakery roll every day and consider it a feast. isabel's character dreams of a normal life but doesn't expect it to happen and doesn't expect to fit into that role so doesn't think much of it. both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their imperfections. without giving up much of the story, isabel's character continues to persevere while the man gets worse and worse in his drug obsession. there is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story that lifts it up for the masses to enjoy, but overall this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between un-worldly misfits that keeps you interested until the end.
