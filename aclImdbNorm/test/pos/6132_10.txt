i watched this movie "miniseries" on television back in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. i would love to track down a copy of it just to watch it again and again. it's been 15 years since i watched it and it still sticks out in my mind.<br /><br /> from the beginning, it draws you in. the characters and plot line keep holding you. the ending was superb. the feeling and rage that the son displayed when finding out the truth about his father are unforgettable. the suspense on how it will turn out and how he will confront his father is really intense.<br /><br />if you can get a copy of this movie, you will thoroughly enjoy watching it.<br /><br />then, email me and tell me where i can get a copy.
