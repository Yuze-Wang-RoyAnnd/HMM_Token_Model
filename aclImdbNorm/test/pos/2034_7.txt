i've been looking forward to the release of this movie since i first heard the concept two years ago, and i was not disappointed. i won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but i will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout. the performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.<br /><br />my only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.<br /><br />(2) this is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. inxs' devil inside was from 1987 and ac/dc's are you ready was from 1990, among other mistakes. this bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. again, not a big deal.<br /><br />oh, i thought of something else that was strange. the steel dragon band members were supposed to be english, but for some reason dokken bassist jeff pilson and ozzy guitarist zakk wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in american accents. that was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so i will forgive that as well.<br /><br />i could probably nitpick all day, but i don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie. i will probably buy the dvd when it comes out, and i will certainly buy the soundtrack cd simply for the six steel dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band steelheart, if you remember them!). the highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where mark wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays "good vibrations" by marky mark and the funky bunch. the surprised look of mark's face is priceless. classic rock and roll flick! score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
