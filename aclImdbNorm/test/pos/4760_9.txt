he plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top cops in movie history. roy scheider stars in a poor man's french connection that has a little of the same gritty appeal. fc is a better movie, but i prefer watching this one because 1) i think scheider is great and this is his best movie, and 2) this has the best car chase ever, one that makes bullitt look like a cable production (thanks again to bill hickman, who actually plays the driver). it doesn't hurt that tony lobianco stops by (again) to play a baddie. please enjoy.
