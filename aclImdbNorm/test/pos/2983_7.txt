i was in my mid teens when i saw this movie, and i was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. it amazes me to learn that alvina has recently died, that bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years, and that both would be in their 50s.<br /><br />the elton john soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion. i have seen the movie poster, billing it as "deux enfants quis'aiment," which apparently means something like "two children who like each other"--the english language distributors were wise to abbreviate the title!<br /><br />paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an english businessman living in paris, meets michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. the two take what they intend as a day-long holiday to michelle's late father's rural cottage, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. they fall in love, michelle gets pregnant, and they have the baby alone at home. after the baby's birth, the police come to paul's work place and take him away.<br /><br />"blue lagoon" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise. so sad that "friends" has never been released on dvd.
