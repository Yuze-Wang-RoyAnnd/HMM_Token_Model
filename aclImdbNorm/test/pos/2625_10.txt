i was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when i first saw this, and i've never forgotten it. i'm a huge joan hackett fan, and this film was perfect for her remarkable talent. i'm so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this. naturally, it's not available on any media! it would be perfect to show on lifetime, but because of its age, they won't. you never see anything there before the mid-eighties. i can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run: rex reed reviewed it in the new york daily news, and he said that it was like a throwback to the great hollywood films of the forties, and had it been made then, the hackett and grimes parts would have been played by stanwyck and crawford. think about that! p.s. so sad that joan hackett left us so tragically young.
