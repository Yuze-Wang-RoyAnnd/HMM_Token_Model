i have the good common logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever and i am acutely aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products. i've been an avid consumer of new technology and i keep running out of space on powerboards - so i know that even the energy crunch associated with peak oil will change my life appreciably.<br /><br />the end of suburbia shows, in a rational and entertaining manner, just how much my whole family's lifestyle will have to change in my lifetime. i am particularly concerned for the future generations who will have to pick up the tab for our excesses, however the film-makers do offer a glimmer of hope in that they acknowledge human resourcefulness and determination - and the sense of community that tends to be engendered by shared hardship.<br /><br />there is no point in trying to pretend that peak oil is baseless propaganda - or in treating it like the approaching radioactive cloud in "on the beach" (i.e. with suicide pills at the ready). even with our best efforts, times will get harder all over, and i'm hoping there's enough compassion and humanity to go around.
