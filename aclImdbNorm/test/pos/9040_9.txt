it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time. the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job! <br /><br />juano hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south. the crowd could really care less about the details--they are just hell-bent on a hanging. and, despite his commitment to the law, the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the truth--just delay the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a legal hanging! fortunately, a young white man (claude jarmin) begins to wonder about juano's innocence and begins seeking out the truth. at this point, the best character in this wonderful drama is introduced--played by elizabeth patterson (the old lady who later played mrs. trumbull on i love lucy). she single-handedly steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience but the will and determination to stand up for the black man. at one wonderful point in the film, a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him, but she stands very firm and forces them to back down. there is a lot more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story, but i'll leave it to you to see it for yourself. see it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.<br /><br />by the way, apparently 1949 was a great year for hollywood finally addressing race prejudice head on, as twentieth-century fox also released "pinky"--an equally effective and strong film about racism, interracial marriage and even rape! see both films if you can.
