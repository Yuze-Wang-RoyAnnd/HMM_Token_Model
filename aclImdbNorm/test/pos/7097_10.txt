this movie was a very good universal monster movie. it once again stars lon chaney as the wolfman and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster. oh yeah, that jerk john carradine is back again as dracula. i like every actor in this movie. i especially liked onslow stevens as dr. edelmann. (it's spelled with 2 n's) i thought it was a good idea to have the goodhearted doctor himself doomed like talbot was. one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr. edelmann is in deep thought as he changes. everything that is troubling him flashes before your eyes. the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes. that's the only reason why i didn't want the dracula character eliminated completely from this movie. i thought dracula had no business in house of frankenstein. if his character was taken out you wouldn't miss him. in this film the doctor's blood is contaminated with dracula's, giving him his jekyll and hyde curse. i hate john carradine and i don't think he should have ever played dracula. i didn't mind other actors playing the frankenstein monster after the great karloff because they all did good jobs. but when they get another actor to play dracula it stops right there. john carradine thought he was so high and mighty. they offered him the role of the frankenstein monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained. i could just picture carradine if he did play the monster arguing with the director on the set, "i don't have to take this from you, i've done shakespeare." john carradine wasn't dracula and he never will be. sorry john, bela lugosi is the one and only dracula. thank god they got bela to come back as dracula for abbott and costello meet frankenstein. <br /><br />don't miss this movie. it doesn't disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other. this is a very good addition to the monster movies. if you're a collector, be sure not to leave this one out.<br /><br />
