unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor, a wanna-be tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro. although the story may seem slightly farfetched (the two boys attempt to river-raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids), the emotion, actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life. being a "big brother" to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released, i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids. superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.
