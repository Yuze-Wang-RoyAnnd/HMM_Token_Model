on one level, hari om is a film using a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: curious westerner explores the mysterious east. but at its heart, the film is about two people, a young french beauty (isa) bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver (hari om) with bollywood aspirations, from vastly different cultures, their slowly growing attraction for each other, and the beautiful mad chaos that is india today. the gap between them can never be bridged, but the director succeeds in bringing the two as close to the brink of an affair as possible without damaging the story's plausibility. india and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative, and except for the main characters, the roles are played beautifully and persuasively by locals recruited during the film's production while on the road between the indian towns and villages that form the film's setting. one major negative for this viewer: a keystone kops chase near the film's conclusion as hari flees mobsters bent on collecting a gambling debt. but the closing scenes where isa and hari bid farewell are poignant and unforgettable.
