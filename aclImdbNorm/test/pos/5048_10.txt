this is a fantastic film. h'ana is a very old guy with a very young heart. he knows how to live his live fully everyday by teaming up with his friend making pranks on just about everything, even his own death. while his wife can't deal with his "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that it's exactly why she loves her husband for almost half century. i would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear of death. he is joyful, witty, mischievous, and never boring. vlastimil brodsk'y brilliantly played h'ana at the age of 79. every look from his eyes and every move from his aging muscles deliver so much about the character to the audience. this is a film that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards, and it makes me look at my own live a little closer. tomorrow i am gonna go and buy myself a mansion and have some fun. if h'ana can, so can i. but i think i will skip the smoking part.
