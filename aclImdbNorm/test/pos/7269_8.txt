i've been waiting since last october to see this film! (it was supposed to come out october '98) and now i've finally seen it i am not disappointed. bloody marvellous! ok it was a tad slow in the beginning, but once it got going it's a very exciting nail-biting tense robert carlyle is so different from either gaz in 'the full monty' and begbie in 'trainspotting' ) that it's hard to recognise him! and johnny lee miller, no longer with his sick boy from 'trainspotting' blond hair, plays his dashing gentlemen highway man with the right about of humour and sensitivity that it is easy to see why liv tylers rebecca falls for him. a great film. as hades in disney's 'hercules' would say: "two thumbs way way up!!"
