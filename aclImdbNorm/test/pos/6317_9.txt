i saw le conseguenze dell'amore on the 2005 rotterdam filmfestival, it was the first of ten films i saw there.<br /><br />le conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films. from the first shot, you know the movie is going to be something special. the beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera. the music is also on par with the visuals, complementing the colorful and stylish architecture-like images.<br /><br />toni servillo plays the main character in the film, titta. he's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel. every week, he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around this.<br /><br />he is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone; looks calculated and well-dressed. he has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him. for example sofia (played very nicely by olivia magnani), who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. although she's been working in the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if she does greet him. on one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar, instead of his usual spot at a window. from here the story really begins, and will unfold in a strong tale of love, sacrifice and the mafia.<br /><br />i won't spoil the rest of the film. see this film if you love stylish movies like ones from david lynch, the godfather, etc. don't see this if you're an action-buff.
