i have seen this movie many times and i never get sick of it. it is about a man coming out of the closet, that he doesn't know he is in. kevin kline's character is a teacher and when one of his former students announces kline's character is gay the people in his town start to speculate whether he is straight or gay. kline's character starts to wonder if he is straight or gay too. the acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious by all the cast. i found the movie very funny and heart-warming. i love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching it. i recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time watching it.
