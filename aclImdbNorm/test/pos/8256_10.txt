this movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which although in essence a comedy it was based on one of the uk's biggest ever bank heists. in fact one of the titles that this film is known by includes "caper" therefore that in its self is an indication of the type of movie. a of a bunch of lovable rouges, who are not the violent or psychotic types, who with cheek an guile pull off the biggest job of their lives. to be honest i don't really know too much about the real crime and can't comment if it accurately depicted the events that unfolded or the characters involved.<br /><br />richard jordan handles himself very well playing pinky green and is very believable as an easy going small time american born crook who seems very comfortable with himself. i have to add that sometimes american actors struggle gel well with english actors in a british made film, the chemistry is not always there, however this is no problem for jordon who fits right in with his role.<br /><br />it's worth pointing out that jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70's and 80's and never really got the recognition he deserved. he seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and b movies, not a fair representation of his acting ability. he has played a corrupt cop in the friends of eddy coyle, a sadistic killer in the mean season. in the secret of my success he played a sort of comical gordon gehco character and also in the 1980's equalizer tv show he played a good guy. all of this displays the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of david niven, kurt russell, edward woodward and robert mitcham.<br /><br />in this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning. you can't help liking green,
