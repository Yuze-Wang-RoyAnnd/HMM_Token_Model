i doubt if the real story of the development of western union would ever have gained a real audience. instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west, it was the story of board rooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and disliked) of the great "robber barons": jay gould. gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant - and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival vanderbilt's. but this, while interesting, is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves. at least, that is how audiences would see it. jay gould died in 1892. had he lived into the modern era, and invested in hollywood, he probably would have agreed to that assessment too.<br /><br />the film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by indians, spurred on by one jack slade (barton maclane). slade, a desperado, is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories. he is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires, edward creighton (dean jagger), creighton's associate richard blake (robert young), and a quasi-lawman vance shaw (randolph scott), who is slade's brother. blake, an easterner with little understanding of the west, is romancing creighton's sister sue (virginia gilmore), but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings. but he does become a close friend of shaw, especially in trying to confront slade.<br /><br />slade was a real western criminal, by the way, and the subject of a section of mark twain's roughing it. he was hanged in the 1870s. but he did not have any involvement in stirring up indians against railroads or telegraph companies. however, maclane makes him a memorably evil, and totally vicious type. his killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance. but lang is responsible for that, as well as other touches. look at the sequence with chill wills, where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it. he spits tobacco juice several times while talking to young, who gets a little splattered. then there is an indian attack which we watch from the ground level. at the conclusion, young suddenly gets splattered again, but it's not brown but red that covers him. he looks up at the pole's top, and there is wills with an indian arrow through him.<br /><br />it is an exciting film to watch, and well worth catching.
