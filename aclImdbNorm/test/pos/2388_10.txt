i viewed the movie for a second time on september 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time i saw it. i thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially "uncle benny". i thought that fred carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. the story line definitely kept your interest and i hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. i felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, lets just say i didn't see it coming. i also thought that craig, the actor who played "eddie monroe" did an excellent job and i hope that this movie will help him to go further in his acting career. from start to finish, i thoroughly enjoyed it.
