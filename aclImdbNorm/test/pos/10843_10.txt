the bbc surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with tipping the velvet. in the past they've been 'daring' with dennis potter's works but this mini-series (as it was screened in the uk) is superb. andrew davies work is top notch - i've not read the sarah water's novel but i can imagine he's done it real justice. i comment on the bawdiness - most men have watched it for that - proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised. the fact is, it portays the lesbian side of society in the 1800s - a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys - well it was - lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors.<br /><br />you can also look at tipping the velvet as a 'love story' - it actually is - as well as 'self discovery' that many gay/bi and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the time.<br /><br />if you've not seen it yet - either repeated on tv or on dvd - get it - you'll be in for a treat - and even the production and filming of it is perfect. just try to hide your blushes in parts - like i said - 'bawdy' is the order of the day - and beware a 'phallus' or two!<br /><br />enjoy!
