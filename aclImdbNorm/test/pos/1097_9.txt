yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder. it was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organising committee's favourite. which is not surprising. the subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid south africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings. i saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children. a film to watch, meditate, discuss and act upon.
