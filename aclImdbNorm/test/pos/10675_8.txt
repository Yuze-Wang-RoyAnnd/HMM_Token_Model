'doppleganger', ( or 'journey to the far side of the sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late donald james ) and produced by gerry and sylvia anderson, best known for their 'supermarionation' television shows such as 'thunderbirds'.<br /><br />the international space agency eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. the committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. but when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.<br /><br />american astronaut glenn ross ( roy thinnes ) is teamed with british scientist john kane ( ian hendry ). after weeks of gruelling training, the phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.<br /><br />three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. ross survives, but kane is badly injured. a light is seen moving towards them...<br /><br />i will leave the synopsis here. until this point, the film has been gripping, with excellent special effects ( by derek meddings ) and music by anderson's resident composer barry gray ( why it has not been issued on c.d. is a mystery ). but when ross and kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. i think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact gerry & sylvia later did something similar on their 'space: 1999' show. ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to earth - his earth. but why? the new earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.<br /><br />roy thinnes had recently done 'the invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). ian hendry is good as 'kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. several actors went on to appear in the andersons' 'u.f.o.' such as ed bishop and george sewell. blink and you will miss nicholas courtney ( 'the brigadier' from 'dr.who' in a tiny role ). but the acting honours go to the late patrick wymark as 'jason webb', head of eurosec. the character is not far removed from 'sir john wilder', the one he played in a.t.v.'s 'the power game'. webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. herbert lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.<br /><br />like i said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. so the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. with a stronger script, this could have been another 'planet of the apes' or - dare i say it - '2001: a space odyssey'.<br /><br />in anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. we are in the future now and people are still watching 'coronation street' every other night. how disappointing. if a mirror earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. if all the women there look like lynn loring or loni von friedl, i will be on the next flight!
