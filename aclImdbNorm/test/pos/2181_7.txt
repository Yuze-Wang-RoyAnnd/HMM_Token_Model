this cheapo remake of the terrific five star final suffers from terrible acting. humphrey bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings. the owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. so they hire the fake preacher (harry hayden) to track down the murderess, who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name. the preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives.<br /><br />bogart is always good. hayden is good the the slimy preacher, and henry o'neill is good as the father. everyone else is just awful. helen mckeller wins no sympathy (crucial for the role), linda perry is a lousy actress, beverly roberts is ok but always looks old, claire dodd and hobart cavanagh have no parts, carlyle moore is a dud as the boy friend, virginia brissac is miscast as the society mother, robert middlemas overacts as the station owner.<br /><br />this one comes in under an hour but is a pale copy of the original which boasted dynamic performances by edward g. robinson, aline macmahon, frances starr, and boris karloff. but it's always worth watching boagrt.
