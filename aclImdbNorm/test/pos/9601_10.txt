i can't add much to what has been said already, except i'm going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policy.<br /><br />i've actually got this on a vhs-to-dvd copy, but the quality is quite poor and i desperately need for it to be officially released.<br /><br />i can just imagine what extras i would like to see (tim healy's character swearing his way through one of those 'football bloopers' type programmes would be great!). you can imagine it now, can't you? but of course, it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a dvd release.<br /><br />surely to god there must be someone in the dvd releases department at itv who also knows something about british culture, is web savvy and has enough about them to look at imdb now and again? oh, well.
