this movie is a fascinating example of luis bunuel's storytelling abilities. this is a comedy that is not a comedy, and a social drama that is not a social drama. even though i don't think it was particularly funny, it made me laugh. also, despite the fact that you can never take bunuel too seriously, the movie made think about religion and its importance in some people's lives. bunuel tells the story of a catholic priest, devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the priest's undying commitment to serve others is put to test. as usual, bunuel's target is catholicism, but i don't think he tried to mock the church as he often does. at least i didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution. i think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always mange to bastardize the concept. message aside, i think this is one of bunuel's most clever works. francisco rabal is superb as the priest. definitely, one of the filmmaker's best movies.
