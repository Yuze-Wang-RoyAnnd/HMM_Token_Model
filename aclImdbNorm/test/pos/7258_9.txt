i don't want to write too much about the film but basically it's an action/comedy with a little bit of romance thrown in about two men who come together in unlikely circumstances and become highway men together. fantastic performance by robert carlysle and everybody else involved. a brilliant 'baddy' who really makes you hate him. some great comical lines - actually laugh out loud, amazing action and a great plot. choice of music and ambiance all fantastic, basically brilliantly directed and brilliants written. i recommend this film to anyone who likes a good british movie or a good bit of action, i don't know why the film never took off, i thought it got no where near as much recognition as it deserved. if for nothing else, watch this film for one of the greatest finale's of all time. not to give anything away, but this one really get's the heart beating!
