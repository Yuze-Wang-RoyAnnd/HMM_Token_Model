there have been several comments already on the site focusing on the "prestige" feel of the film - and there is a lot of heavy-weight talent on show: from fiennes and scott-thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring, to the masterly direction. no wonder that andrew lloyd webber's acceptance speech for "evita" at that year's oscars began "well, thank god that "the english patient" had no songs in it." writing of oscar winners takes me to juliette binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. it is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for best actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. just as emma thompson's hugely well-deserved oscar for her portrayal of margaret schlegel in "howard's end" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of "goodness" involving, so binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy. her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty.
