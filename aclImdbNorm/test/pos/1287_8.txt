i just finished watching following and i thought it was great. i rated it 8 out of 10. i plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.<br /><br />i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher nolan's more recent movie memento. following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for memento. even the music in some parts is very similar.<br /><br />shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. the story and dialogue is really good. the performance of the actors is believable.<br /><br />christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget. i look forward to his next release insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino.
