brian keith as cole wlikerson and richard jaeckel as wade matlock make excellent villains. they just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal way possible, and sneer sexily at any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends. it's a pity that goody-goody glenn ford gets in their way.
