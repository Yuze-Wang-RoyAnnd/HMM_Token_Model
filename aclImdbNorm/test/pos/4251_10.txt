this movie got better with time. i can't believe that it has been forty years since i saw this at the age of 15. yes, that's right. movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both midnight cowboy and putney swope in the same year. imagine the times. bobby kennedy and martin luther king has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and woodstock. putney swope was the woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man. you'll see where robert downey, jr. got his sardonic brilliance. his old man was an instant hero to kids like me. no punches are pulled in this classic, and aging hippies will rejoice when they relive this era. hopefully, new flower children will be emboldened by it, and this current era of fascism will come under the same scrutiny my era was subjected to.
