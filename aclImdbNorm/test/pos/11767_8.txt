a fun romp...a lot of good twists and turns! (and we were not even baked!)<br /><br />didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd...(oddly it was there along with the city of lost children, and the adventures of baron munchauhsen)<br /><br />the plot keeps you wondering throughout.<br /><br />the acting was awesome...hank azaria shows his talent again, bill bob is billy bob...(wecis?)<br /><br />definitely worth watching.
