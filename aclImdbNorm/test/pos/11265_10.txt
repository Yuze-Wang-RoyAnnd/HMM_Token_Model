this performance leaves you with no wishes. we saw it in offenbach, germany, and it is breathtaking. we only got the cheap tickets at the far back but still had a view over everything that happened. if you ever get the chance to see this live then go! it is worth the trip and if i were you i would wait a good half an hour after the show to 'cool down'. the performances are breathtaking and all around the tent there are colourfully dressed performers that are there to distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent come alive. the music - live music!! - is as good as the cd-version: perfect! i bought a dvd later but the show that was filmed had less colourful costumes. it's the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet. a great trip for old and young, and a great film, too
