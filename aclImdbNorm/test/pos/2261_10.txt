if you've ever been to ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. from teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. i spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, "yep. that's exactly right." it's a lot of fun if you understand russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice. the actors are so believable and elijah wood does a great job playing a socially inept jewish kid. my favorite character is definitely sammy davis jr. jr., the grandfather's "seeing eye dog" who is really a psychopathic border collie. the characters are so eclectic and likable that you believe that they are real people.
