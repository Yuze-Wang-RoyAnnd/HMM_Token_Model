these days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. about 95% of shows on disney, nickelodeon, and cartoon network fit the listed criteria. to put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. it as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail. they couldn't be more unaware. sure kids enjoy a good laugh and erratic behavior (if it's done to a conservative level and done right), but as they also want to enjoy a story, see drama, and see people being challenged. they don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. they know this world isn't all fun and games, they know it's not perfect. everyone has problems, and we all must learn to work around them. this show revolves around that kind of stuff. alex mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything going for her genius sister, annie. her mom works at some office but is sometimes a stay at home parent. her dad, george, is a top scientist at the plant, a chemical corporation that employs most of the town they live in, paradise valley. alex is unpopular and picked on by most of her peers. her only friend is ray (but she gets more friends as the series goes). on her first day of jr. high, alex walks home not too happy about school, but a truck delivering chemicals from the plant crashes into a fire hydrant trying to avoid running her over, dumping a strange chemical known as gc-161, where the chemical mixes with the water, covering alex in it. soon after, she starts to develop strange powers such as morphing into a puddle, shooting lasers out of her hand, and moving things with her mind. she also glows constantly when nervous (though we never see much of that later on). aside from her sister annie and friend ray, alex decides to keep these powers a secret from everyone, even her parents for fear of being kidnapped by the plant, whose corrupt owner, danielle atron has her head of security, vince, search for the mysterious gc161 kid. every episode then deals with alex trying to live a normal life as kid at the same time learning to live with her strange powers. the series may seem like a girls show, but it's not. as a boy, i liked watching this show because of its awesome effects and drama. the producers successfully add some elements of science fiction with the elements of teen drama. in fact, some episodes were quiet violent and a little eerie. the unfounded plant manager atron and vince make good antagonists for the series, for the writers really do establish them as a threat and give you that dreadful feeling every time they come on screen. also, smart move adding david, driver of the truck that spilled the gc-161, as vince's bumbling assistant in the hunt for comedic effect but also you get to love him towards the end. it was interesting to watch little alex try to live as a normal kid but struggles to perfect her powers. at times, you forget that these are kids who are battling a giant adult run institution, because you are drawn in to the story. the show does a good job of relating to kids by showing alex that she may have super powers, but she still is a kid, and must be careful. even some episode you'll find yourself distraught at alex's calamities. my favorite episode where alex wishes she was never born truly demonstrates most of these elements. as i said, the producers never hesitated to add in some laughs whether they come from ray's one liner or george's strange habits or david trying to be a nice guy. of course you come across corny moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the series plot, but what good series doesn't? all in all great show. 9/10
