i thought the movie started out a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour. however, it became more absorbing, fascinating, and surprising in its last two hours. so, while it starts out like a cheap horror film, it evolves into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film.<br /><br />bridget fonda stands out as the snow queen. this was her best performance and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance, as she has not acted in the last 7 years. she absolutely personifies both the beauty and coldness of winter.<br /><br />my daughter, age 14, found the film a bit frightening, so if you are showing it as family entertainment, please stay with your child and reassure her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously.<br /><br />it is really one of the best fantasy films that i have seen in a long time, slightly better than "eragon" or any of the "lord of the rings." it is about as good as "the golden compass".
