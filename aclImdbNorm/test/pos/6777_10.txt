many americans are lazy, and this has manifested itself even in our dvd-watching. many of us don't like to take the time to read an hour-and-a-half (or more) of subtitles, so we choose not to see many foreign films. one film that is totally worth your time, no matter how mundane a task you might think the subtitle-reading is, however, is "the green butchers." it's by far the best foreign film i've ever seen, and tops many american films i've seen lately as well. it's a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue. the character depth derived in this film is amazing. the way svend and eigel (sorry if those are spelled wrong) feed off each other's contrasting personas is downright spectacular! the actors were well-cast, and i'm very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration...it needs very little of bjorne and what's-her-face...just give me svend and eigel on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue! to the author of this fine screenplay, i say: write more! the story itself is rather twisted, but you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow...with no remorse. please check this movie out!
