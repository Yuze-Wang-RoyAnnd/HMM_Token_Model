in the movie, "the falcon and the snowman", when they were showing christopher boyce around the complex, the satellite in the background was the actual ryholite satellite that is now in space. trw allowed interior shots. trw also allowed both interior and exterior shots for one of the original star trek tv series. (the episode is the one where spock goes blind when a string of satellite lights are activated to kill the aliens). christopher escaped jail (lompock) and was featured on america's most wanted. he was drinking in a bar when the show aired. he said, "hey, that's me". needless to say, he was captured and transfered to a maximum security jail.
