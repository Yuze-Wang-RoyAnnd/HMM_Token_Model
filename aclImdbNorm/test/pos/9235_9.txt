this film proves you don't need a hollywood budget to make something fun to watch. what stuck with me is how the crew from different locations was able to pull together with no promises of riches to make something just because they believed in it. i think anybody who makes low budget movies can relate to certain scenes such as actors who just can't get that one line, being bothered by the police, and having most of the crew disappear after the first week. nobody got paid for this which says a lot for the people who had to travel cross country and for the long hours spent editing. after watching stuie sell his personal property, use his own money, and trash his house to make the movie i am a bit curious how close his wife may have come to leaving. good job to all.
