i wasn't planning on watching wasted when i saw the mtv preview but since i had nothing better to do or watch on a sunday night i watched it.<br /><br />wasted was no requiem for a dream but it was a very good movie considering it was made by mtv. one thing that drew me to watching it was summer pheonix the sister of the late and wonderful river pheonix stared. i suppose talent runs in the pheonix family because she was good and so is jaquien though niether are river. nick stahl also gives a great preformance as a junky jock. there isn't much else to say about wasted. it was a dark depressing and insightful look into the lives of three small town junkies. i recomend it to those who like the subject. 8/10
