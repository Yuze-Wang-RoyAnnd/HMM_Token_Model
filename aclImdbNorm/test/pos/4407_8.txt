i first saw "the knowledge" during a thames television marathon on one of the local independent stations in los angeles back when it was new. i enjoyed it very much along with danger uxb.<br /><br />that a movie i saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to it's originality and the quality of the performances by the cast.<br /><br />i looked for a dvd copy here in the u.s.a. and found none. i finally gambled and bought a uk dvd off ebay and was delighted to find that it has no region code. so those of us that would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
