this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. i saw "capturing the friedmans" a short while ago and have to admit i thought this was better.<br /><br />the story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.<br /><br />51 birch street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption.
