when i first heard about "greek," i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. another of abc family's so-bad-they're-almost-good shows. but tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected.<br /><br />as a member of a greek society, i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. and are also very fun to play with just on are own, let alone to watch on a tv screen. the opening scene harkened to an only-slightly-dramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there.<br /><br />this isn't a show for over-sensitive greeks. if you get offended even at jokes about things that aren't-so-great about greek life, then you'll spend the entire first episode, and probably many other, cringing and yelling. but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it. it's nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing ever is.
