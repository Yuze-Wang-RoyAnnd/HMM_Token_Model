the film is really good, it doesn't use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plot(based on the original by michael caine) and some great actors to make a fun, action packed film which i thoroughly enjoyed. one thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as edward norton(who i last saw in 26th hour, which i enjoyed also), jason statham(transporter, enjoyed that also) and seth green who i think is great, his role as shawn fanning's roommate dubbed "the napster" is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in la. the car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. i haven't seen the original so i can't really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone, it isn't a film where you need to like that specific genre, it will suit everyone, i felt good after this movie, it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch. i give it 8/10. go watch it!
