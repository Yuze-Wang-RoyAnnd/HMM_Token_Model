as previously stated in one of my great reviews, the universal pictures'trilogy of flash gordon should not be classified with the other serials. for,indeed the three of these have made a sort of celluloid-electronic mythology for a punchy, war phobic mid twentieth century world. they stand alone in many peoples' minds as the example of just what a cliff hanger was.<br /><br />we can recall seeing buster crabbhe as a guest on nbc's late night talk show, tomorrow, hosted by tom snyder. this was circa 1979-80. during the interview mr. crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. he credited weight training and swimming, coupled with some sound dietary habits-which included vitamin and protein supplementation.(and would you believe it, he smoked several cigarettes!)<br /><br />when questioned about his career, mr. snyder of course got to the subject of his portrayal (and strong identification with) the character of flash. buster stated that he had read and enjoyed the feature in its original medium, that is a comic strip the property of hearst's king features syndicate. he stated that he had thought that it would not work once transferred to the screen! luckily he was wrong.<br /><br />as for the 1st serial, it was a very good adaption of the original continuity from the sunday color comics. the world is about to end because of impending collision with planet mongo.it's up to independent working dr. zarkov to rocket to the wild planet to change its course. he enlists the aid of flash and miss dale arden, newly acquainted parachuters from airliner, landing in zarkov's property.<br /><br />the serial has excitement through out and manages to make one feel that there is always some other peril lurking just outside the film frame. the costuming and decor is varied,from romanesque to oriental to art decco. it would be easy to surmise that this was due to frugality on the part of universal,but once again this was being faithful to creator,cartoonist alex raymond's visual concepts.(just look at the old strips as reprinted in many collections) the rockets were used before in just imagine! (fox 1930), a science fiction musical comedy.the other scientific lab equipment was provided by universal's prop dept.,being the top hollywood company doing horror and scifi.<br /><br />the cast features jean rogers(dale arden) and priscilla lawson (princess aura)who get into a good girl vs. bad girl battle over flash. charles middleton portrays emperor ming in a sort of overly melodramatic villain,but makes it work. zarkov(frank shannon)is toned down from the sheer madness that he suffered in his appearance in newsprint. (by the way, ever wonder how zar-kov has a brogue?) richard alexander makes a fine, powerfully built prince barin, ever helpful and so noble.<br /><br />comic actor jack "tiny" lipson is the surprise of the cast, stealing scene after scene as a lecherous, henry viii like scoundrel turned ally, king vultan,ruler of the hawkmen. among the others, most notable is jim pierce as prince thun of the lion men. pierce,like crabbe, had also portrayed tarzan in a film-but he later married tarzan creator, edgar rice bourroughs' daughter, joan.<br /><br />flash gordon and the two sequels, flash gordon's trip to mars(1938) and flash gordon conquers the universe(1940), have been a staple juvenile fare for generations,first in the movie houses then in television release. like fine wine, they seen to get better with age.<br /><br />we're all so glad that mr.crabbe was wrong.
