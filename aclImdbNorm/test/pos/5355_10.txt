i really refused to see this movie. i refused to go with the school and i refused to go with my parents. just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid, to me anyway. one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices, "the dukes of hazzard" or "wallace and gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit." it took me 17 minutes to decide. time was running out. i had to choose. it came up on the screen "few" as in a few tickets left. by the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could go in. i desperately wanted nicholas to go in to see it. but he forced me. i crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that i was going in to see this childishness. i walked in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say i was very surprised that i sat through that masterpiece! it was amazing. i don't know what i was complaining about. the clay animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life. the story was brilliant. about a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years. basically anti pest control are protecting the people who are competing in the vegetable competition. anti pesto known as wallace and gromit (who are in charge of this business) try to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. i wont say anymore. it's just too good to tell. i'll admit that the whole idea of a were-rabbit is ab-it unbelievable and ab-it childish, but nick park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it. i mean, there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in " dog soldiers." then again, were-rabbits and werewolves aren't actual creatures. but either way, it worked out very well. <br /><br />the jokes also were more grown up. the kids wont get some of the jokes. it goes way above their heads. it had a lot of british jokes in there. if you love british humor, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />i also loved the cast and the voices. everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. the direction and pacing was absolutely...fantastic! i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and gromit shorts (and no, i haven't seen them yet), and i recommend it to fans who liked "shrek" and "shrek 2 and most importantly, i recommend it to the people who love clay animation. cracking good movie! 10/10
