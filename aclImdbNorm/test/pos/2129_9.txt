this is a nicely-done story with pretty music, lots of dancing, lots of big sister/little sister interaction (almost all of it positive), and lots of wishes granted. there are funny moments that older children and adults will enjoy, such as when king randolph exclaims, "they're just shoes! aren't they?" and tender moments such as when princess genevieve comforts her youngest sister, lacey, after a blunder.<br /><br />the animation is perhaps not as good as disney, but it still is very good. the facial expressions are nuanced, particularly for genevieve, king randolph, duchess rowena and her servant, derek the cobbler, and little princess lacey. my only quibble on the animation is in the dance sequences where the dancing princesses become absolute carbon copies of each other without the slightest deviation -- even the three youngest copy the dance steps perfectly. i would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dancing, considering that these girls are not professional ballerinas or chorus dancers.<br /><br />the resolution of the story is handled cleverly to get rid of a villainess without actually hurting her. there is some violence done to guards in the story, and the villainess's monkey is mean to other animals in the story.<br /><br />my 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and has watched it repeatedly, and i have found it to be quite acceptable for her to watch.
