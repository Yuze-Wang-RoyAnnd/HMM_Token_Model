this movie is pretty good as it is, but the unreleased producer's cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. jamie's story is handled differently, the death scenes are done 10 times better, there's more footage of ritual type stuff giving more story about micheal, jamie and her baby. there is also an alternate ending which is also better. why they didn't release this version instead i have no damned clue. if you can find this version, see it.
