can't say this wasn't made well. at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. and there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. but this is an oddly non-hispanic film in the same way west side story was many years ago. both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. the setting, a sort of underground car repair district in queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself. but there's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film, namely, what the sister feels she has to do to get by. i can understand the brother's reaction, but it just seems a little too easily come by to me. the movie seems to suggest that people like these don't need our help, that they'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems. i wouldn't encourage anyone to believe that. there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted. other than that as an entertainment it works well. as an accurate depiction of a culture, not so well, i think.
