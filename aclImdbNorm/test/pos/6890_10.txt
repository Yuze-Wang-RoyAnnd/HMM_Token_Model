all i can say is i really miss this show!! my wife & i just got married around the time this show started up!! why did cbs take it off the air??? i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy!! it made me laugh!! it also made me cry. but when cbs took it off the air my wife & i thought cbs made a big mistake. you know what would be so great?? have a reunion show!! that would be so cool!!!! anybody know if it is on dvd yet?? on the last season of promised land, did cbs show the whole last season?? i think cbs took it off the air at mid-season. my wife & i will never forget it. the opening with that theme song was fantastic!!! this show only comes once in a life time! may we never forget promised land!!
