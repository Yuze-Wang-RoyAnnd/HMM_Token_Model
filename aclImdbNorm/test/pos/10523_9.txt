i happened to catch about the last 45 minutes of the movie,late night about 8 years ago. what a wild and funny 45 minutes.i was absolutely knocked out by chase-shoot-out at the end that takes place at night ,inside an old hotel that's being torn down with a wrecking ball....incredible. i vaguely remember stacy keach ,stealing a cop car, faking being a cop and strong arming some winos....wino to keach"hey,why ya hasslin us?...keach"it's my job".you're correct. they don't make them like that anymore.great movie. the golden70's...hopefully it will see the light of day as a dvd along with other lost treasures...hickey and boggs being one such.
