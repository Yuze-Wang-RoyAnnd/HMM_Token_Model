i blame "birth of a nation" myself - for commencing the long-running tradition of hollywood travesties of history, of which there can be few greater examples than this. apart from getting the names of custer and his 7th cavalry, crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right, the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man, the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits. throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition, (try custer and his wife's learning of the phony "gold rush" to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory, custer's testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all, custer's storming into the president's office to beg to return to his post), honestly there's plenty more of the same, some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness... ...and yet, and yet, it's still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever, dehavilland as beguiling as ever, the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences. ford taught us in "liberty valance" to believe the legend before the truth. here i think we're closer to the legend of the legend but hey, it's only a movie and a rollicking, wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that!
