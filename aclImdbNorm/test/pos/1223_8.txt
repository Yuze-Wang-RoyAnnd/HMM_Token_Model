well unlike most people.... i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film. pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors. they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together. it's a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesen't quite turn out how you predicted. i don't want to give away anything about the story so i wont... but i suggest giving this one a chance. if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie. maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold?
