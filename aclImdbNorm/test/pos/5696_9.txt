while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic i really connected with it. there is no plot as such, rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them.<br /><br />personally, i thought the acting was mostly very good, despite the roles being quite demanding at times, and i felt a sense of warmth for the characters. the situation they were in was quite terrifying and i really felt nervous for them. i found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival.<br /><br />the crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film, and believe me, i have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies. the creature moved well and had real menace and, although the audience i was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared.<br /><br />script-wise, i would have made a few changes, particularly towards the end, but this was not a major problem. for fans of slow-burning survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately i think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed.
