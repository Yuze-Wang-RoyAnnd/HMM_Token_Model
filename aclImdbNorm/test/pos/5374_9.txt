the '70s were a great time for horror movies. the brotherhood of satan is yet another overlooked gem. it's full to the brim with great surreal, unsettling scenes. it's also great to see stother martin and l.q. jones (who also produced) in decent roles.<br /><br />some of it is a little dated and cheesy, but the brotherhood of satan kicks butt over race the devil and many other '70s satanism flicks.
