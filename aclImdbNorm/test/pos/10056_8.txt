i haven't been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now, however, i thought i would comment on this film.<br /><br />this film mistaken. one of them, as well as madonna, was panned by the critics. they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews.<br /><br />first, madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first. she plays a ditsy blonde in the film, she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life. most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn't give her a fair shake. when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting. she was absolutely hysterical as was the film.<br /><br />griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film. if you take a look at his filmography, you will see he is quite an accomplished actor.<br /><br />as far as the movie itself, this is something similar to pretty woman, but came 3 years before the roberts, gere success. it's a goof-ball comedy with lots of site gags, slapstick and one liners. some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor.<br /><br />i know this doesn't tell you much about the movie, however, i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie. it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun.<br /><br />peace.<br /><br />gary
