i truly enjoyed this film. it's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well. in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion. both women deliver warm, touching and at times humorous performances. the film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. and yet the approach wasn't heavy handed. the production values were also top notch for a small budget film. i saw this at the philadelphia gay & lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. it was a real crowd pleaser. everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film.
