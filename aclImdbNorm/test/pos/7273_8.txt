** here be spoilers ** <br /><br />recap: macleane (miller) witnesses a robbery by plunkett (carlyle) that goes wrong. plunkett's partner get shot (and killed) but not until after he has swallowed a great ruby. plunkett and macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get hold of the ruby. unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to jail, but not until plunkett has swallowed the ruby. the ruby is their key to freedom, and once they're free, they form a partnership in robbery. macleane is to pose as a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing, and then simply they rob him (and rob them in style). but macleane falls in love with the niece/daughter (?) of their first victim, lady rebecca gibson (tyler). and a mr chance (stott) is out to catch them, and his methods are not very nice...<br /><br />comments: a good action flavoured by comedy and adventure. carlyle and miller form a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. and then there is the relationship between macleane and rebecca gibson. the scene with the ball is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of the music. in addition to these interesting characters cumming play the best of them all, lord rochester. both the character and the acting are stellar and among the best in the movie. in total, the movie works very well, a nice balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. very entertaining.<br /><br />8/10
