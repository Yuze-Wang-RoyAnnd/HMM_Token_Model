quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and a treat to watch. i'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film. i simply wish to congratulate this small film with the great big heart. i tip my hat to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast. if you want to know what happens in the film...then go see it. michael parness, writer/director, has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter , suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. i see a great career ahead for mr. parness. this film works. right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between david krumholtz and natasha lyonne. as with every movie, we need to suspend some disbelief, yet i found with max and grace i was easily transported and completely convinced with it's "surreal moments". i only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further. mr. parness has "pulled" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. for instance guillermo d'iaz' performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. the colossus ralf moeller, former mr olympiad, as a terrified patient...perfect. i can go on and on...this independent feature has the star power of a big budget hollywood film however, you forget about the stars on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story. the real star here is the brilliant screenplay. i look forward to seeing more from writer/director michael parness.
