the filming is cheesy. some of the actors overact. some of the actions are unexplained and unexplainable. but...<br /><br />this movie is in the mode of the psychological dramas of the 50s.<br /><br />it is a morality play. similar to the movie in which a "method" actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage, ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is the film editor. it gives him a nervous breakdown which leads to a complete psychotic break.<br /><br />
