growing up as of child of the movies, one of the trilogies i shall not soon forget is that of the karate kid. you can put down ralph / daniel all you want, but its the message behind the movies that are important, that its important to be respectful to all creatures great and small, but stand up for yourself when the time calls for it. getting back to the movie at hand, its rather funny because, i saw boys don't cry and was really impressed with the performance of hillary swank, and in flipping through the sea of channels the other night, i came across the showing of this film and i hadn't realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it. the story centers around julie, just like daniel, not knowing where to fit in or if she even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her out and guide her. i really liked this addition to the series as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes, even some outfits that hillary were in kept me, shall we say stimulated.<br /><br />overall 3.5 out of 5
