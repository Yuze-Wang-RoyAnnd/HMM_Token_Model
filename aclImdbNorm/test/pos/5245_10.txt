i just saw the big trail in vienna's filmmuseum for the first time. immediately i was astonished by both the pictures optical high quality and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed story. who has ever seen such a documentary style western with john wayne? and there is so much time, you can actually look around on the screen, there is so much to see! one is ever grateful that the scenes are often static, because every single shot is so well composed and you want to take it it. even the acting is good and fits in well. the long running time of the picture is wonderful, you don't want to miss a minute of it!
