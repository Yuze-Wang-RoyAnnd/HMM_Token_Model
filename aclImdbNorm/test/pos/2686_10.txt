this show is brilliantly hilarious! i started watching in 2007, and had never heard of it before then. after one episode, i was hooked. i'm never home to watch it, so my wife bought me the entire series on dvd. non stop laughs, need i say more? i wish it was still on tv, because it is definitely worthy and a whole lot better of crap on currently on tv.<br /><br />i wish they would make a movie, seriously, who wouldn't go see it. kevin james's name alone will bring a huge fanbase to any movie, the guy is (make your stomach hurt) funny.<br /><br />just a really good, down to earth, believable show. if you have the chance to buy it on dvd, do it, its worth it.
