i don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. i really don't. dark -yes, bizarre - no. it i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the pinguin's story. they say it has elements of s&m but i really don't find anything of that sort except for catwoman's whip.<br /><br />this movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. they have strong motives with strong feelings involved. catwoman (a great performance by michelle pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by danny devito). again, i think michael keaton is the best batman and he carries his costume well.<br /><br />you can totally see that it is a tim burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. but also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.
