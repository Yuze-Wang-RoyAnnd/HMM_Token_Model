this picture was released in may of 1979 starring playboy playmate susan kiger as honey shayne, playboy playmate lisa london as o'hara and playboy playmate pamela jean bryant as terri lynn. in one of the most delicious sec comedies in drive-in history a bevy of bouncing young lovelies all come together in a tale of battling bikinied sorority sisters who will stop at nothing to bare everything. so what does h.o.t.s really stand for? you're going to have to watch the movie to get the answer. you see, the girls are having there problems with the society girls on campus that make them out to be nothing but sex craved maniacs. therefore, the girls set out to discredit the society girls no matter what they have to do to get the job done. in addition, cut up in this mess is the dean of the college who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they grow out of control. i loved this movie especially lisa london. i thought her acting was fantastic and i'm disappointed that she didn't get other acting jobs. based on the three playmates alone i give this movie 10 weasel stars.
