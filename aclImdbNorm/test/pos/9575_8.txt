you know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people i know, i think that's the reason why i loved this movie so much. i was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it, but the dialog is so hilarious, that you can't help but have a good time. basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously, it turns out the owners are just as insane. megan, one of the dog owners, goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog.<br /><br />there is another couple that is just great, gerry and cookie, this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable. in the beginning of the movie, gerry describes how many boyfriends cookie had. throughout the movie, her "lovers" see her and hit on her even in front of gerry! it was just great and fun to watch gerry's looks. this whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. it's a great movie is just fun to watch, i'd highly recommend it! now, i have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. :d <br /><br />8/10
