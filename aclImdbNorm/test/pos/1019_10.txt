okay, i love this movie!!!!! i watched it over and over again. it is so hard to tell who the attacker is. you keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is.<br /><br />summary: gail osborne is raped and left at her home. she is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. it goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend, to her teacher who takes a liking to her, to her ex-boyfriend, all different stories, all suspects. but who did it?<br /><br />i love the acting, they have a lot of great talent in here. the suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb. if it comes on tv watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
