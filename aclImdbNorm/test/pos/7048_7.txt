if you take the movie for what it is worth, you won't be disappointed. if you think murray is supposed to win an oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting, don't bother. it was funny when i saw it in 1979 and hasn't lost its charm. good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks. the story line is simple and easy to follow. murray has done better, but this is his first film. the movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained. morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfect. the other counselors are typical revved up teens looking to have fun during the summer. one nice thing about this movie, it has a message.
