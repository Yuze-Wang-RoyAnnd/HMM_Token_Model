absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close. jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it. patrick stewart's claudius is ferocious and still sympathetic -- i particularly like the two doofuses playing rosencranz and guildenstern. very feckless and yet sinister. some might gripe about the need for a strong ophelia -- she's not a strong person, that's the point, and lalla ward hits the proper nuances. amazing. simply amazing -- every one of the more than two dozen times i've watched it.
