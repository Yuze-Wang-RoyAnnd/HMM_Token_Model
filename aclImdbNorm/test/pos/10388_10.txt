if you speak french or can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. if on the other hand you just want to see god's most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. not an ounce of silicon in sight. zalman king eat your heart out. sophie marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever fantasized about. her part is even in english. even the fact that she was nude with john malkovich did not detract for her beauty. sophie is a ten if ever there was one. chiara caselli and in'es sastre are 9.5s. oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of separation style.
