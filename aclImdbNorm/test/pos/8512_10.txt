people criticize nsna because it is a low-point in bond god sean connery's career, and because it is unofficial. ***may contain spoilers* first of all, this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then connery, all sub par wannabes in my book. sean connery is the only real bond, no one comes even close to his toughness, good looks and sex appeal. yes, this movie is a low point in connery's bond career, but it is still the definet best bond film of the 80's. sean connery is the only bond actor who is good at an older age. he did not become a baggy mess like moore, but kept his good looks and toughness, but gaining some gray hair. so what? hes still the only real 007, and he is as cool, and tough as ever. sean connery is the one and only 007. and this movie is definitly worth seeing, no matter what anyone says. no gun-barrel opening, but you can't have everything, can you? great theme song, though.
