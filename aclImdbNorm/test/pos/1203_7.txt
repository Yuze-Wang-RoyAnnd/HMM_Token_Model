(may contain spoilers) i find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. while it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. the acting and photography are excellent. some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, "where do i go?", "easy to be hard", and "black boys/white boys". while i have not seen the stage musical, i think that it clouds the judgement of many. this is not the musical you see in theatres. do not attempt to compare them. the theatrical musical might have been sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on film, so a plot had to be added. and the ending that has been added is just amazing. the movie left me feeling like i had actually watched something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy on one level.
