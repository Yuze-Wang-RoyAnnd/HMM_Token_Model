"walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every regard. kenneth branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. the script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework, it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go. the music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. but the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well. the scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply astounding effects. this is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too.<br /><br />in conclusion, this is a must watch. not only did i love this, but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen. if anything, it could have done with being longer, other than that this is perfect. 10/10 bethany cox
