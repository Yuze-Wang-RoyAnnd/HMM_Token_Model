it's quite simple that those who call this movie anything below "decent" do not know their cinema. "the doll master" creates a sense of dread and suspense rarely seen in movies outside of asia.<br /><br />think of a mixture of "manga" and "ringu" rolled into one and this is what its all about.<br /><br />first rate acting, first rate direction, first rate sets and effects.<br /><br />this is right up there with the best of asian horror cinema; ringu, dark water and a tale of two sisters.<br /><br />an absolute must. <br /><br />take it from a guy who knows his movies.
