it is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years. surely, it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as the platoon, apocalypse now, the doors, the dog's heart (russian film). really, the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say that they "play". no, they live as if it was happening to them. notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them. the hate and love in one piece. and the final scene!<br /><br />really, i'm still under impression of that film. it's very hard, even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy, but if you succeed (and frederikson did) the impact would be twice strong.<br /><br />i compared it with "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". i like this film either (and the novel itself is good, too), but after frederikson's movie it seems simple. (the same difference i noticed after i watched the film "american history x" and "romper stomper" - the latter is deeper). i mean milos forman only showed the material point of view of the problem. you watch it, then you say yes, it's a good film, i like him, i don't like her, and that's it. but "angels" leave you a wide base to think. there are no bad and good boys in the film. cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do. like the girlfriend of one of the patient. of course she's young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger (the result is his suicide). why ask him what have he done? aren't you insane yourself to ask? why do not support him, help him, understand him? finally, it is even funny when those people talk to each other. they say genius things! there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film, but i'm not so good in english. but i'm sure, those of you, who have watched the movie, understand me.<br /><br />good luck!<br /><br />
