this movie is an all-time favorite of mine. i'm sorry that imdb is not more positive about it. i hope that doesn't keep those who have not experienced it from watching it.<br /><br />i've always loved this movie. i watch it about once a year and am always pleased anew with the film and especially the stellar performances by entire cast.<br /><br />i've always wondered whether jean stapleton actually did the ending dance with travolta???? if anyone knows this piece of trivia, please leave a comment.<br /><br />thanks and enjoy!
