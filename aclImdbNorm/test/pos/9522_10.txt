i always loved french movies because i think they are filled with much more emotion and sense than the americans. this film is a gem.<br /><br />starting with the wedding which is so funny that you just want to join them and in the end where the little family kids tell us who is with who which is extremly funny. catherine deneuve is simply hot and so good that it is absolutely possible that a young man can fall in love with her, and vincen lindon is perfect for that role. the best scene (except the wedding party) is in the family reunion where antoine has got mad and yells his feelings to lea in front of the family. it is such a shame that i could buy this film only from the french and not from the english (so i have to learn in french to enjoy watching it)!!
