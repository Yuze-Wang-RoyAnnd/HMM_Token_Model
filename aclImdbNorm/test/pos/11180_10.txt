the curse of monkey island is a brilliant video game and its a stroke of genius from the video game designers at lucasarts to have created this sequel. all the characters are brilliant, the voice overs for the characters were realistic and funny. a lot of effort went into this game and it deserves the 10 i gave in the vote, keep up the good work lucasarts!
