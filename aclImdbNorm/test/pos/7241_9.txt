while not quite as good as a murder is announced, which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. and you know what, it is a huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version. now i don't take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script, a confusing final solution or both. the geraldine mcewan version suffered from a plodding pace, and both of the above problems, and i would consider second worst of the itv adaptations, worst being sittaford mystery, which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing. this adaptation of the book nemesis is a huge improvement, it not only respects the book, despite a few liberties, but it pretty much rectifies the problems the itv version had. despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating, more to do with how he was written than how he was acted, and one or two moments of sluggish pacing, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. it is beautifully filmed, with nice photography and period detail, and the music as always is excellent. the performances are wonderful this time around, and make the most of an in general well-done script, with joan hickson brilliant as always as miss marple, and solid turns from liz fraser, helen cherry, joanna hole and anna cropper. margaret tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as clothilde. overall, well worth watching, better than the recent version in pretty much all departments. 9/10 bethany cox
