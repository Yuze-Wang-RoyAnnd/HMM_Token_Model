i thought it was an excellent movie. gary cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously! over all, i thought the movie was great, definitely not a boring plot line! it's sad to say, but i think lots of men might feel this way. i think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to, but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death. i thought it was neat that cole's real-life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie. i think what the guy did was alittle extreme, but the movie was great nonetheless! definitely recommend it!
