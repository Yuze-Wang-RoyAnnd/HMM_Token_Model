though often considered peter sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film sellers was best known for; satirical farce. this film had excellent performances by jo ann pflug and pat morita (of happy days and the karate kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. it was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the monty python crew would take into the cinema some time later. as such, it was unacceptable to the traditional peter sellers fan, who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed. presently, peter sellers movies are in demand by fans, but this effort, where does it hurt?, has by its nature become almost impossible to find.
