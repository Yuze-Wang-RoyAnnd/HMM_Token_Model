this is not especially well written. the songs are not memorable. the cast, however, squeezes a lot out of this martin and lewis in the navy situation. they both look great as young sailors. they are believable. the scenes on the submarine show how cramped it must have been on those underwater missions in the 1950s and before.<br /><br />lots of sailors in many scenes. hundreds perhaps, in a big outdoor exercise field, and again in a boxing arena.<br /><br />you will see james dean in his scene. he does stand out even though he is an extra here. in a scene where jerry walks across a busy street we see some of his "almost accident" comedy which he would bring into play years later in the patsy.<br /><br />dean giving jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch for. jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy that was his trademark in the late '40s and early '50s. dean and jerry dancing is a bit of a treat. not great, but better than most non dancing movies.<br /><br />worth seeing if you don't mind black and white. good ending.<br /><br />tom willett
