one of my favourite films, whenever it is on, although i do admit one time missing it when it was on foxtel last year.<br /><br />despite the age of the film it doesn't look like that and the story even though it'd been done a thousand times before still felt entertaining. there were one or two little niggles for me in the story but i looked past them and just enjoyed the film for what it was.<br /><br />overall i give it a 7/10
