just go see this movie. it taps into everything awesome about rock and roll, the band comes up with some great songs (classico, pick of destiny, master exploder etc). all this with the humor of teancous d makes this the best movie ever.<br /><br />the cameos are great right of the back, with meat loaf and dio singing to jb. ben stiller and tim robbins are great, i really like tim robbins character. you also find out who satan really is! the music and musical references are hilarious and awesome. playin songs great songs from the who, dio, and others just complete it. i personally didn't think the band could top the awesome songs of the d, but they did with songs like classico and master exploder. seriously awesome music.<br /><br />just go see it, its a must for anyone who loves rock!
