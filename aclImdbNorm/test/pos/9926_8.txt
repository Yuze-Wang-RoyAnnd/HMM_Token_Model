one of his lesser known films, many horror fans have yet to catch this dario argento offering, which is unfortunate. it is underappreciated mostly because of the fact that really not enough people have seen it. the film boasts grade-a argento gore, with his customary close-ups set to savage rock scores. while it true that this script is not very complex, it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre, or his own personal resume for that matter.<br /><br />this movie symbolizes more of the 'dread' that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. worth a good look on any night.
