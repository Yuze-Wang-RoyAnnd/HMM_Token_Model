the original the man who knew too much brought alfred hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the united kingdom. of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. the original film was shot inside a studio.<br /><br />for whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him (paramount)decided to see what the man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget. this is shot on location in marrakesh and london and has two big international names for box office. this was james stewart's third of four hitchcock films and his only teaming with doris day and her only hitchcock film.<br /><br />i do wonder why hitchcock never used doris again. at first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that hitchcock favored. possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. <br /><br />doris does some of her best acting ever in the man who knew too much. her best scene is when her doctor husband james stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an english couple who befriended them in morocco. stewart and day play off each other beautifully in that scene. but doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. <br /><br />day and stewart are on vacation with their son christopher olsen in morocco and they make the acquaintance of frenchman daniel gelin and the aforementioned english couple, bernard miles and brenda dabanzie. gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in marrakesh and whispers some dying words to stewart about an assassination to take place in albert hall in london. their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.<br /><br />for the only time i can think of a hit song came out of a hitchcock film. doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. the song was que sera sera and i remember it well at the age of 9. you couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising elvis presley that year. que sera sera won the academy award for best song beating out such titles as true love from high society and the title song from around the world in 80 days. it became doris day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.<br /><br />in fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.<br /><br />instead of doing it with mirrors, hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real albert hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed, it's choreographed. you'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.<br /><br />this was remake well worth doing.
