the 1990s was a great decade for british sitcom with many popular creations such as one foot in the grave, absolutely faboulous the thin blue line, the brittas empire and men behaving badly arriving onto tv screens for the first time.<br /><br />however, mr. bean is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s.<br /><br />mr. bean represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton for several decades. it brings to the audience a single character - mr. bean - played to perfection by rowan atkinson.<br /><br />many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not mr. bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability. however, i believe this debate is unnecessary because i highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider mr. bean in such a context.<br /><br />mr. bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others. some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show. this is where the humour derives from. mr. bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way. and naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see mr. bean try to resolve.<br /><br />sometimes, we see mr. bean show a mean or petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it. but no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring.<br /><br />unlike most examples of british comedy in the past 30 years, mr. bean is simple, inoffensive, harmless u-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy. it is for this reason why the tv series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world. it is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other tv shows will have come, gone and been forgotten.<br /><br />some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet i laugh just as much at mr. bean's antics now as i did when i first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s. rowan atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time.<br /><br />the tv series has to date spawned two spin-off movies, bean and mr. bean's holiday. as one familiar with the type of humour shown in the tv series would expect, it does not translate to success on the big screen. the two movies do little justice to the tv series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes. the greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting. in both movies, the producers take mr. bean out of his normal british surroundings into america (the first movie) and france (the second movie). as a result, the movie characters around mr. bean respond differently to his behaviour than their tv series counterparts. both movies re-use gags from the tv series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time. in the second movie, mr. bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny. at various times, i found myself thinking that the character i was watching was not mr. bean but a pale caricature. it is clear that rowan atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the tv series. his heart just wasn't in the performance. after the second movie came out, he stated publicly that he would not play mr. bean again. i realise how he felt.<br /><br />returning to the tv series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies.<br /><br />my favourite episodes are the first three - these set the high standard that was to continue. i consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless.<br /><br />to summarise, mr. bean is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family. rowan atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this tv series. my recommendation - watch and enjoy. but only see the movies if you consider yourself a die-hard fan after seeing the tv series.
