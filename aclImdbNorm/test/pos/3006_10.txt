i loved this show. i was waiting for it to come out on dvd....it never has. does anyone know how to get the show available on dvd? i have contacted lifetime tv and a few others and nothing. please let me know if there is a way we can have this series on dvd. iwould be first in line to purchase it. i really got hooked on this show. i do not understand how a bunch of other tv shows are available on dvd but not any day now. i am sure there are many of us out there who would love to have this series on dvd or even vhs. i thought of contacting the production company. has anyone else out there tried to contact anyone for this information?
