i wasn't sure about getting this movie on dvd because i really do have something against people making black and white films in the 21st century, but i ended up buying it anyway. i still don't understand why it had to be black and white, but that's the only negativity i can see about the film, and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of brazilian cinema. not everyone can understand a film like this, but it's quite rewarding to those who do. unlike o homem que copiava, the surrealism fits this movie pretty well, and the acting is at least as good as that one, or other successful brazilian films such as bicho de sete cabecas, cidade de deus, brava gente brasileira, etc.. <br /><br />my only hope is that this gem doesn't get insulted and raped by a crappy hollywood remake. it's amazing to see how those guys spend zillions of dollars and still can't make a movie that's 1% as good as this possibly low-budget flick. <br /><br />bravo to the entire crew! 10/10
