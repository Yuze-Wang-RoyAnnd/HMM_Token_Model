well, i saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other making-off from vh1, too bad than this one it's pretty outdated but you get to see all the staff who makes south park, very interesting stuff.<br /><br />it's also funny than this documentary portrays trey and matt like selfish greedy snobs creators who doesn't work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing (which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the show).<br /><br />it also shows all the animation process to make a south park episode, interview with the actors who brings character's voices and much more.<br /><br />if you're a fan of south park i highly recommend you this.
