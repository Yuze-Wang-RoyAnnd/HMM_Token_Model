when i first saw the movie, i thought it was sweet - a family movie. for the rest of the night and over the next couple of days, though, clever moments and funny lines kept creeping back into my thoughts and our conversation... there's a lot going on, classic elements of farce, good character acting, and wendie malick's story line is just hysterical. labelling it a "feel-good movie" belies the wit and fun - it's smarter than it seems, just like "it's a wonderful life" is.
