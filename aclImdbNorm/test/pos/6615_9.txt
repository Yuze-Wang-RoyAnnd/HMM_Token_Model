this is one of the greatest documentaries i've ever seen along with "dark days". i have skated for maybe an hour my entire life, and i still love this movie. peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly, helped in part with some incredible archival footage. tony alva is one of the coolest individuals in existence. love those knee high striped sport socks, you rock tony!<br /><br />not only is this movie a visual feast, but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history, if you're into 70's rock. buy the dvd, you won't regret it.
