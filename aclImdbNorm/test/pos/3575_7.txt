jim varney's performances as the harem girl and a.u. are amazingly funny--on a level surpassing chaplin and keaton. linda kash is great in her once-in-a-lifetime role as the hometown waffle waitress longing for adventure. unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the movie was unwatchably bad due to the atrocious plot. the makers of ernest goes to africa did not rise to the creative challenges inherent in low budget film production. only worth seeing on cable.
