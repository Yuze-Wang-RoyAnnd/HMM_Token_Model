i didn't know anything about this movie before i watched it. it seems to be a lesser-known teen horror from the 80's. what struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that era.<br /><br />the first thing i noticed was how slowly this movie builds. it doesn't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one. it takes its time building the back story, leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen. i was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie. but everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes, and then it gets fairly graphic (this was a bad time to take a snack break--i almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started).<br /><br />the characters also seem slightly more three-dimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks. there conversations were refreshingly level-headed for the most part, as opposed to the over-the-top stereotypes you'd expect. for example, the girl who is the popular, snobby, queen-bee of the clique isn't constantly spouting insults at everyone, but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others.<br /><br />so, to summarize, i felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what i expected, and a little better made as well. it drew me in, kept me interested, and then let me have it. as i said, it's pretty gory during the finale, but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time. i don't need to own it, but i'm glad i discovered it.
