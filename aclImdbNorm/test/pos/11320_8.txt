this is a pretty good made for tv flick of the 'what if' variety. as in, what if terrorists exploded a 'dirty bomb' in a big city, in this case, london. lots of poking at folks that say 'we're all set in the event of an emergency' that then reveal that they're not exactly telling the full story. and is anyone prepared for something like this? you can bet not. this shows the material for the bombs being smuggled into the country, the making of the bombs, the secrecy and double lives that the people behind it lead, etc. it also shows public servants (i.e., firemen) giving their all to save people when they aren't getting any help, when the government doesn't want to send anyone else into the affected area. also shows how woefully inadequate 'preparations' are for any such occurrence, as the government talks everything up but then stands there with their mouths hanging open as the tragedy unfolds. and could this happen right here in the good old usa? well, unless you've been living in caves for the past 20 years something already has, to an extent, and don't bet that anyone would be prepared for something of this nature. this is fairly realistic and yes, even scary. well worth seeing but just hope nothing like this ever really happens. 8 out of 10.
