it was so very long ago (1960), but i have never forgotten this series and often wished it would reappear. so taken with it, i corresponded with mr. rathbun, then president of standard oil, which sponsored the presentation on pbs. he sent me a photo of the tapestry (actually a charcoal rendering) used behind the credits.<br /><br />to the opening theme music of bayco's "elizabethan masque," my family and i gathered around our black & white tv to drink in shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players (at least to american audiences at the time).<br /><br />we were introduced to such actors as sean connery, dame judi dench, tom fleming, patrick garland, julian glover and robert hardy. i have continued to enjoy their accomplishments ever since. one of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles as shakespeare's "king" plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order.<br /><br />i wish i could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me.<br /><br />if "age of kings" could be revived on vhs and/or dvd, it would so please those of us who long to see it again and those who missed it the first time around.<br /><br />good news! pbs has just issued a dvd of "an age of kings"! see their july 2009 catalog, page 19, or call them toll free. i just ordered mine!
