what you saw in bullitt and the french connection is nothing compared to what you have here. the chase goes on for nearly 15 minutes and is the best you'll ever see. this movie has become a classic crime drama from the heyday of 70's film-making. it's a gritty and realistic portrayal of the mean streets of new york city. featuring one of the slickest wise guys ever put on screen, tony lo bianco's behavior in this movie is cool as ice. he's ripping off his own associates and making it look like the police are responsible. his childhood friend, roy scheider, is a street detective who becomes puzzled by the disappearances of the mobsters. you can tell that lo bianco's enjoying the game throughout the movie. at times though, the film gets dull, but then right when you feel like giving up on it, something big happens and it pulls you back in. the score by don ellis sets the tone of the cold, gray wintertime in new york city and to top it all off, my man joe spinell shows up in an early role as toredano the garage man.<br /><br />score, 7 out of 10 stars
