i have mixed emotions about this film, especially as it compares to its forerunner,<br /><br />"an american werewolf in london." that film had it's funny moments, it was still more of horror tale than anything else. this updated version, now set in paris, does not have that "edge" at all and simply isn't in the same class....but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch. <br /><br />so, "werewolf purists" aside, most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version, i'll still give it decent marks since i don't care what others think. i liked it even though i agree "london" is better and i prefer that version, too. <br /><br />the first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. it also introduces the lead female character, played by julie delpy. i don't see enough of this actress. she doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones i hear about over here in america. this french actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great.<br /><br />when the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. i also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no lord's name in vain - amazing!<br /><br />however, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either. this film is geared a lot more toward 20-somethings, if that helps anyone.<br /><br />it's entertaining.....just don't expect it to live up to the first film.
