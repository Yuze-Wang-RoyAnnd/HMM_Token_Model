this is an exceptional film. it is part comedy, part drama, part suspense. the dialog is exquisite. most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their time, and for good reason. you will probably recognize someone, even if you don't usually watch older movies. they are also each in a role that particularly suits their talents. <br /><br />one correction to make on another users comment is that two people, not one, are announced to die in the accident. maybe the unlucky two are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life. the movie is too engaging to worry about who it is until it happens.<br /><br />the story is ahead of its time, but it does not lose the quality of an older movie. time and effort was spent perfecting the camera's view and the soundtrack, something modern movie makers tend to forget.
