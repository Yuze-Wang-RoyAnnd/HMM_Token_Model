inglorious basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a no holds barred assault on the senses. tarantino doesn't care if he offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clich'es, this is film making at it purest. it's great to see a film maker whose work clearly isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. tarantino is a master of effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed! it's not for everyone and i'm unsure how germans will take the film, certainly if you're not a fan of tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. no self respecting film fan should miss this. and the performance of christoph waltz... oscar don't you dare ignore him!!
