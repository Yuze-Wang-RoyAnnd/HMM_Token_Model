if you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable looney tunes cartoon. the animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. the writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. i really did love the arguments between daffy and bugs, and that bugs wins every time. i also love it that daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. i do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too. bugs is still his charming and rascally self, and elmer is funny if rather dumb too. in short, this is absolutely brilliant, and actually my personal favourite of the hunting trilogy for sheer entertainment value. 10/10 bethany cox
