so well made, no cgi crap. has anyone else been on the "jumping crocs" tour of darwin's adelaide river before? black water was way realistic; rogue was a bit cringeworthy.<br /><br />thought the blonde chick was excellent in it - haven't really seen her before. and the other chick is a babe, she is always excellent. <br /><br />v. suspenseful - i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick. <br /><br />got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys, as well. <br /><br />loved it!
