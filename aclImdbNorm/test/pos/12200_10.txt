surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season. i can honestly say i modified my schedule so i could be home to watch every episode. tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc.<br /><br />story was of a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature. the same sea creature that had killed the main character's brother and the woman character (oceanographer) had seen. most people think it is a deadly killing machine but the one raised from the egg was very friendly.<br /><br />only problem is nbc canceled it so now we'll never know what happens... hopefully sci-fi or some other channel will pick it up.
