that's how burt reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever. he plays tom sharky, a vice detective who's on the trail of an international mobster (vittorio gassman) and the man he's financing to be the next governor of georgia (earl holliman). in the novel by william diehl, the story is more complex because the guy's running for president. this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two. the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story. reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films. he's very serious here, especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong. at times though, the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobster's woman. only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax. just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin, sharky's machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker, julie london, flora purim & buddy de franco, the manhattan transfer, doc severinson, sarah vaughan and joe williams. al capps handles the score with magic. this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever. check it out.<br /><br />score, 8 out of 10 stars
