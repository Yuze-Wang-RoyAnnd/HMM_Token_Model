this movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s- not like the recent "failsafe", which seemed more of a stunt than anything else, but a true moral drama that is both engaging and thought-provoking. anne heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior, played by sam shepard, and eric stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment. i found myself waiting for their affair to begin, if only because they look so good together. this movie is apparently based on a true story, and it's a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change. <br /><br />directed by christopher menaul, who also did the passion of ayn rand (with stolz) and the prime suspect series, this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing.
