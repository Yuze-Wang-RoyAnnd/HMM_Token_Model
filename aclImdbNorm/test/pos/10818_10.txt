i saw bon voyage 2 days ago and i found it an excellent production. the film is supposed to entertain, and it does! it emulates the style of the american screwball comedies of the 30s, but von voyage is more refined. adjani and depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. the plot is simple. the film starts with people involved in many situations that, apparently, should have nothing to do between them. it is very funny how those situations become linked during the film. it is good to see a french film with this kind of sense of humor. i find it, principally, a film in which love is the main theme. peter coyote as the german spy in france shows once more to be an excellent actor, too.
