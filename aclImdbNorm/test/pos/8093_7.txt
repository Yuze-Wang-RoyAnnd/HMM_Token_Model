most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on nazism and fascism, made at the height of those movements' success.<br /><br />sadly, in the final moments of the film, chaplin abandons all pretense of making art (not to mention comedy) and switches completely to propaganda. and not anti-nazi propaganda, either, but some of the most mawkish and idiotic "progressive" propaganda ever to ooze out of hollywood.<br /><br />never mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with the message.
