i was expecting this movie to suck, but what i got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. the teens are decent, with penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch. rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. i saw the "twist" coming from miles away, but i still enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />but what really stood out to me was the direction. gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him. aside from overusing the horror film "speed cam"(you know, where like the guy's face shakes all fast?), there's some good shots here. the camera angles and environments really emphasize kane's size, making him look even bigger than he actually is.<br /><br />if you're looking for deep story or characters, this ain't it. but that's not what slasher films are about. if you're looking for some good violence, or if you're into gory films, go check this out!
