jimmy stewart brings the story of charles lindbergh to life as he almost narrates the entire film while he crosses the atlantic. it well edited with flashbacks over lindeberghs life. franz waxman score is shear brilliant and truly gives the picture a heroic feel. one of stewarts finest roles and this film can deliver time after time. look for appearances by murray hamilton ( the mayor in the jaws movie) as bud gurney.comes out on dvd 8-15-06 with the release of a few more of stewarts classic films. i consider jimmy stewart to be americas greatest actor and never tire of seeing him in any film i see, watch this picture and you'll agree.
