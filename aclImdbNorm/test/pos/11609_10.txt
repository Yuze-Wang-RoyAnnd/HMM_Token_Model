i've been able to see this great movie at the fantasyfilmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down *g*! i've really seen lots of movies and there are just a few i'd call perfect like fight club or koyaanisqatsi! subconscious cruelty is now one of them! half of the people watching it in berlin went out of the room and i can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his/her perfect world day by day dreaming his/her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet-in our life! i don't think i have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page! it's a movie that shows everything and more!!! gets 10 points + from 10!!! it'd be cool if you people who have also seen it loving it would write me an e-mail!so far i haven't met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as i am!!! finally sorry for my bad english-i'm not a studied person (und das ist auch gut so!!! :-))))))
