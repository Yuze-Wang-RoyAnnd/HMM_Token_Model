meryl streep as kate, a woman dying of cancer, performs her role admirably. no wonder she was up for an oscar. in the part she proves that caring and nurturing housewives are just as important as their sisters out in the business world. and the lesson she teaches about life's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows, that is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. we can expect too much of our mates. realize that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. this is a sombre movie and the ending though sad, shows reconciliation between the father and daughter. i give this one a ten.
