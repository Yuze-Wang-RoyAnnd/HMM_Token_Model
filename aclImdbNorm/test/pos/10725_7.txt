the child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. it was a pretty weak field for best picture that year. i think "apocalypse now" should have taken it, but the academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus vietnam was still too recent. meryl streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. i don't usually compliment directors, but i really liked that bit with the elevator doors. grade: b
