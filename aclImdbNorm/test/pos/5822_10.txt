oz, is one of the most mind-blowing and addictive tv experiences ever.<br /><br />having caught pieces of this on sbs, i was at first skeptical, however, having finished now the 4th season, i sadly know that that this brilliant show is approaching its end, (6 seasons), and yet i still can't get enough of oz. <br /><br />want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit...oz fits the bill, hands down.<br /><br />this isn't kid's stuff, folks, its violent, brutal, and not pretty. why, its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison.<br /><br />tom fontana's oz is brilliant in all the right departments, the actors, the writing, and directing.<br /><br />hbo's oz site is also highly recommended, for newcomers, for info about this series. this was the first one-hour show, produced by hbo, and it proves what a master-work it is and that others would follow.<br /><br />thank-you hbo
