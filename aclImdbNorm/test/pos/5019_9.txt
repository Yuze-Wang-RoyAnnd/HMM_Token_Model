why would this film be so good, but only gross an estimated $95,000,000 and have no award nominations? john travolta knows what he's doing. he knows he's michael, a cigar smoking, womanizing, magical arch angel that came down to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of "the national mirror" and their dog, sparky, on the way to chicago. it then turns into a road trip that's both horrible and great. i don't even think the death scenes (3 to be exact) make this a tearjerker. the soundtrack is the best with "heaven is my home", "up around the bend", and "chains of fools". i have very great expectations about this and i say that it should have had a little more respect in the 90's. read my comment. bye!
