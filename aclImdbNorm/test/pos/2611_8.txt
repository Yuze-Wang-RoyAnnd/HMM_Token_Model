assy mcgee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. the twist here is that assy is literally a walking buttocks.<br /><br />the cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. that is not to say that assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. the title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. the sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme. in one photo, a police cruiser is shown and the "camera" zooms in on the front license plate holder, which is vacant. the meaningless zoom-in satirizes the production of the typical 70s-80s cop drama and, incidentally, makes me laugh every time.<br /><br />all the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can't control assy; the loyal, minority partner who acts as a foil to assy's recklessness; the regular cops who detest assy's means.... all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama.<br /><br />the voice acting, primarily performed by larry murphy, is nothing less than spectacular. assy's voice--breathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken slur--is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all-time greats like stewie griffin (family guy) and homer simpson (simpsons). though the voice is slurred, the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. this is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understand.<br /><br />besides the fantastic production and voice acting, the script is also hilarious. assy's no- nonsense directness fuels most of the humor, particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force.<br /><br />if you have access to the adult swim comedies, assy mcgee is certainly worth the watching. each episode clocks in at a mere 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.
