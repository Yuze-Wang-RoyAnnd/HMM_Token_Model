latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre. most of the films entail sappy stories, one night stands, and let us not forget infamous baseball teams? latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark, and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged at blockbuster or badpuppy.com. the films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre. not until this film had i seen a story of such intense passion and love, and the torture that it can bring. i think when people cry during movies they should be beaten, but i found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live. i suggest every gay male see this film, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him...
