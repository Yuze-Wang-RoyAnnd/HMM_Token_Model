i loved this film! markie post is really great in it. i saw it on lifetime, and it's in the same entertaining class as films like: 'the betty broderick story', 'locked up: a mother's rage', etc.... {which, by the way, are also very good, entertaining films!} it's an over the top drama, about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle-class, predictable personality. this movie is just pure entertainment! it doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction. but, it does show how any "regular" middle class person can (& they do!) get addicted to heroin. junkies aren't just homeless uneducated people on the street. {by the way, if you do watch it, check out how the kid bosses his mother around! spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
