having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970's, watching a film like "the seven-ups", or its kindred spirit, "the french connection", always evokes fond memories of a time and place which, for some, might have been nyc's darkest hour, but which for me, in my early twenties, was always one fun-filled adventure after another. i truly miss those times. as one reviewer remarked, "this film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of the nyc winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture.". a spot-on characterization of both the film and the city. the stellar attributes of this film -- the plot, the cast, the characters, and of course, the car chase -- are amply described in many of the reviews here, so i won't go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase, when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman. the look of horror on richard lynch's face, along with the defensive gestures, are so out-of-character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it, that it is actually comical to watch. i get a chuckle out of it every time.
