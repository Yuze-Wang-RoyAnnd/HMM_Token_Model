blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and wesley snipes delivers what i would say to be his best performance yet.<br /><br />this film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller, it has plenty of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed bad buy, moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.<br /><br />their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, wesley snipes fighting movement is fantastic.<br /><br />this film is in my opinion a must see, wesley snipes cool, solid appearance makes this film and i can't wait for the sequel 'blade 2' being released next year.<br /><br />my imdb rating - 9 out of 10
