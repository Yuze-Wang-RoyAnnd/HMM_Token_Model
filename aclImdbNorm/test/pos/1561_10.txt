at the story. it is reality mixed with americana- and very original.<br /><br />emily grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job, in new england. her sleazy boss propositions her- she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. driving from new hampshire to miami, florida, is not a short trip, and her ford escort dies out. she then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by judith ivey and bill raymond. they have an rv and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road. especially i-95.<br /><br />emily grace is very realistic as alice, and initially lets the judith ivey character help her; buy her decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. at first it is a nice vacation for alice, who hopes to hook up with her girlfriend, who attends college in miami. there is interesting cinematography, as the trio drives the rv down to florida: the rest-stops, bland scenery and eventually beautiful mountains of north carolina.<br /><br />eventually there is something awry, and the ivey character apparently has fabricated stories about her daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a bit sinister.<br /><br />i will not spoil the outcome of this film- but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense- this film reminded me a bit of spielberg's "duel"- while it was initially not as menacing- the moral of the story is - you never know what people are thinking- especially if you are driving cross-country. beware!!. you will enjoy this film.
