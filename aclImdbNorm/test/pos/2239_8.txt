i was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that i haven't yet and i found this little screen gem. one of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it. darn, well i guess i will get ridiculed and spat upon here, but for me this was a pretty good flick when i saw it. it has been awhile however, i remember it used to come on hbo late at night and i watched it two or three times and i haven't seen it really since and i would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it. the story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them. i think that is basically all there is to it, throw in a few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie. some good action here and there, and some blood and violence as well. there is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other. the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film, but for a b-movie it is really good. i don't know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that, but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those.
