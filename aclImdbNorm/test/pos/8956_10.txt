i first watched this movie in istanbul film festival back in 1994. it was so good i took couple of friends with me and went to see it again the same week. the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing. it sure is a very powerful gay movie. some scenes make you feel you're watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines. i guess i'll put it in my vcr and watch it again tonight...
