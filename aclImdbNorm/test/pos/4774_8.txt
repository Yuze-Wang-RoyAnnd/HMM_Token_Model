no doubt about it. this is the animated short that put uncle walt on the map of success. when walt's older brother,roy suggested that the next mickey mouse short should include sound, walt jumped at the chance. the result:steamboat willie was a runaway hit for 1928. it was, after all, the first animated short subject with a synchronized sound track (mostly music & sound effects,as dialog was minimal). not to sound like a wet blanket, but the short is far from perfect. animation prior to 1935 was creaky & rather herky jerky (but once equipment made improvements,and better artistic techniques came about,the rest was smooth sailing),and the sound was primitive (disney wanted to use the then well known rca sound system,or the western electric noiseless sound system,but was refused by both firms,prompting disney to use the photophone system that p.a. powers was experimenting with at the time). the plot (there's an actual plot line here?)concerns mickey (as the aforementioned willie)is the pilot of a steamboat, that is terrorized by black pete (captain pete to you),and decides to have a jam session on ship, using the various animals on board as musical instruments (aspca, take notice). if you don't think too much about the technical shortcomings, steamboat willie can be eight minutes of fun (and a piece of history).
