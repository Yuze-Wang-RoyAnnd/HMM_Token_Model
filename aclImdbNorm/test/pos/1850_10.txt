i saw this movie with my mother, and i loved it! it was such a sweet story, (not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) they never make movies like this...ever! my favorite part is when grace(minnie driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams, "what was god thinking?" i do believe everyone(no matter who you believe in) has thoughts like that once in awhile. but while it's very sappy, it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all.(sigh)<br /><br />the comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack up(especially in the aforementioned scene, it's terrible, and yet so funny!). they make a good pair, and i hope to see them again in something soon. 10/10 stars
