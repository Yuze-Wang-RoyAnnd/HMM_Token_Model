i was extraordinarily impressed by this film. it's one of the best sports films i've every seen. the visuals in this film are outstanding. i love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. the film moves well, offering both excitement and drama. the cinematography was fantastic. <br /><br />the acting performances are great. i was surprised by young shia labeouf.he does well in this role. stephen dillane is also good as the brooding harry vardon. peter firth, justin ashforth, and elias koteas offer able support. the film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life actually made me want to watch a golf tournament.
