beautiful film set in 1962 hong kong about a man (mr. chow) and woman (mrs. chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair. stylistically, the film is also beautiful. wong kar-wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). the film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period. it's sexy without showing everything. wong kar-wai also doesn't allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that mr. chow and mrs. chan should be together. smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the curls of smoke. a really lovely film. just prepare yourself for the ending.<br /><br />
