farscape is the best sci-fi show period, for one main reason, everything the show attempts, it does very well. from a technical aspect, the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show. the special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv. the acting is also great, too many shows nowadays use only the american market of actors for their shows. remember the first time you saw the matrix and you said, wow where did that agent smith come from? its the same feeling that you get watching claudia black, anthony simcoe, lani tupu, virginia hey, and especially wayne pygram. these aussies are great and it comes through in this great show.<br /><br />the plot is second to none. the next closest thing i can think of is babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes, but this tops even that. its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes sequential again, the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed. the overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. i am always itching for the next show.<br /><br />the comedic episodes are funny, the drama episodes are touching, and the action sequences are tense. the beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing aloud, something that rarely happens while watching television that is not south park, sealab 2021, or seinfeld. the drama is even harder, whether crichton is meeting his mother or the characters face thier mortality, all is done with heart and intensity. lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops. this is sci-fi.<br /><br />if you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest, if you enjoy good television at all, if you like good serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to watch farscape.<br /><br />oh, and ben browder owns.
