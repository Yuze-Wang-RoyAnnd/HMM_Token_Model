where do i begin? walt disney's happiest motion picture "lady and the tramp" is one of, if not possibly, my favourite in the theatrical canon of disney animation. the sequel, however, is... to say the very least, enjoyable. i enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. it was, (flame-shield up!) adorable! the broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked, and i was humming the songs for the rest of the night. i can, if you asked me to, still sing all of the songs.<br /><br />but where the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in a lot of other places. the animation was kind of scary at times. every time there was a close up shot of someones face, i don't know... it just seemed scary to me. also, where the hell was lady? she gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs scamp at the end. she gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son!<br /><br />but all in all, i liked it. compared to the original does it hold up? no. the songs aren't as good (still kind of catchy though), the plot was a lot less involved, lady had almost nothing to do with it, and it's not as cute as the first one. but, if you go in with an open mind, you'll have fun, and maybe 'gasp!' like it?
