h.o.t.s. is a fun film for a trip back to when skin flicks had a more positive fun-filled agenda. they were made simply to titillate and have a few laughs. everything seems less cynical and jaded. the girls all have natural figures and some are playboy playmates. the simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non-sanctioned sorority house to get back at the snooty sorority girls who spurned and insulted them. instead of the mean spirited tricks of today, most of the hijinks are simply innocent fun. the women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive. to keep our attention between the topless scenes, we have mafia henchmen, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky house mother, and the cheapest robot ever seen. there's even danny bonnaducci of the partridge family. if you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.
