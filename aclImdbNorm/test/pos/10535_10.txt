this is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever, maybe the best cartoon of all time. it had everything action, adventure, thrill, and much more...<br /><br />i can't imagine how hard it was for ruby-spears company to make this great cartoon, there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it, for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because i wouldn't call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent!<br /><br />the cartoons will never be the same as they were before, that is why i hope that they all will be released on dvd specially the centurions as it's my favorite. i have the whole complete set of 65 episodes on dvd-r but it's not the same because if they were released on dvd the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the dvd's in almost every store which means a lot to the fans. my good friend ted made this petition to either get the show back on tv or better on dvd, that is if we get many requests to get them back on dvd.<br /><br />so please help us by signing the petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600f/petition.html
