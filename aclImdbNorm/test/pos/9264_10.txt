i have always been a huge fan of "homicide: life on the street" so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up, i couldn't wait.<br /><br />let me just say, i was not disappointed at all. it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen. it was great to see everyone back again, but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back, because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show.
