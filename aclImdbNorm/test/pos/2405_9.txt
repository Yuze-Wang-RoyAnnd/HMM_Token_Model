well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! in this 4th sequel to the karate kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! well first of all i applaud them for finally getting rid of ralph macchio. i felt he never did service to the role of the karate kid. i would have rather have seen danny 'ralph mouth' most in that role. macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! instead they put in a girl! they got hillary swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in. i personally don't care for her buck teeth, but thats a personal preference. but still, look how karate kid 4 launched her career into orbit! she won a freakin oscar. jiminey christmas! meanwhile where is ralphy?? he should put out some amateur porn tape like screech or something.<br /><br />anyways, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. as a self-proclaimed master of karate, i have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. the first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls... well except for judo... but thats kinda gay. so for the purposes of accuracy, i think they should have stuck with another male for this role. i was thinking perhaps dennis franz. he would give the role the depth it requires.<br /><br />perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in karate kid 5. its too pat marita is no longer. i was thinking maybe justin guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable asian fellow mr. miyagi. he will give "wax on wax off" a whole new meaning. hahahahahaha funny huh? anyways, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with karate and triumph of the human spirit, karate kid 4 is for you. don't waste your time with 1-3. this is the karate kid for you! this is the karate kid for r the ages!
