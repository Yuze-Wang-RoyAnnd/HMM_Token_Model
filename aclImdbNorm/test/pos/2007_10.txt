drawn by pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema i have ever seen. here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: <br /><br />episode one was even better than i expected and from everything i had heard about it, i expected quite a lot. i am very impressed with the actors already. the father was creepy and played perfectly. the little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. the animation was superb. the cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly. the editing was done so well, each scene blending seamlessly into the next. the music captured the emotions quite well and drew you into the story. i just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. it definitely whets my appetite for more! <br /><br />episode 2 was even better than the first one! everything i said about the first episode carries through, only you get to see even more of the character development. i can not wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the series for that matter. what is developing is an intriguing, character driven storyline with all the trappings of a big hollywood production, but without the pretension. so much is said, with so few words. this series is something like you've never seen and perched to become a real success.<br /><br />this episode was freaking awesome! no other words describe it! wow! everything that i've said about the previous episodes holds true for this one, and yet it was even better! i don't know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better! the further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece. the cinematography excels as it always has and draws you into emily's pain, fear, hate and emotional roller-coaster. i can't wait to see episode 4... or the rest of the series for that matter. you have truly outdone yourself!<br /><br />as much as i have loved the other episodes, episode 4 is the best yet. i love the character progression. i feel like we are really coming to know emily, her pain, and her internal struggle. the other themes i've stated in past reviews are continued. great cinematography, the writing is superb, the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own, and the animation is simply amazing! another great job from the dbp crew!
