dirty dancing - i think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. i can remember as a kid i loved this movie and watched it over and over again without tiring of it.<br /><br />now that i'm a little older, i bought the dvd recently and still wasn't disappointed with the performance.<br /><br />swayze and grey create the atmosphere for this movie, even though it's claimed they don't get along, the chemistry in the movie is unbelievable! as the movie proceeds, we are sucked into their relationship, and believe every single one of their actions. <br /><br />the soundtrack is amazing, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between baby & patrick.<br /><br />the last scene makes this movie, who can ever forget the famous line "noboby puts baby in the corner." the song is perfect and the dancing is amazing! <br /><br />i would recommend this movie to anyone, at any age, it's just a fun movie anyone can enjoy 8/10.
