i watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the jesus out of me. i loved it so much and i was dying to get my hands on it.<br /><br />in 2002, i remembered that this movie existed but i had no idea what it was called, so, i went to the i need to know section on imdb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. anyway, eventually someone on imdb told me, so i researched and tried to buy the movie. so eventually i got a hold of it on dvd, and i now keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies. i really love it, and i think anyone who watches it, will be very scared in the woods the next time they go. 9/10.
