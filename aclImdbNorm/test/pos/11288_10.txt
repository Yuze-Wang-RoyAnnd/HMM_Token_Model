i want to preface this review by saying that i have no idea what "begotten" is truly about. all i really know is that in the beginning god kills himself, in turn birthing mother earth, who proceeds to impregnate herself with god's semen. she then births a son. the rest is pretty subjective, and you have to interpret it in your own way.<br /><br />how i chose to interpret the film was this; god killing himself signified the start of the scientific revolution, when people started questioning the doctrines imposed by the church, like the geocentric view of the universe and etc. mother earth symbolized people starting to think for themselves and reject the church's "it happens like this because god says so" views. the tribal people were the church lashing back at them, trying to force christianity down their throats. i'm not exactly sure how son of earth fits into all of this. mother earth and the tribal people seemed to be fighting over him, so maybe he represents the freedom of people or something to that effect.<br /><br />i have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean. bludgeoning, raping, then dismembering mother earth and son of earth and grinding them into the ground like a mortar and pestle could mean anything, but that is where the fun of this film lies; you can interpret it any way you want. there doesn't have to be a definitive meaning to it, you can let your mind wander. sometimes you don't even know what you are supposed to be looking at because it is shot in a weird angle or it is too fuzzy.<br /><br />the only thing that disappointed me was that i was expecting a truly terrifying film. i was going into it thinking i was going to get a phone call immediately afterward with a foreboding "seven days" warning. what i got was pleasantly different. it was not scary at all, but it stirred my imagination. trying to decipher the movie's cryptic message was a creative challenge. there were many scenes that were in fact beautiful. mother earth just after she was born and the final shot of the forest path come to mind.<br /><br />so overall i would have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this film. it is certainly the most abstract movie i've ever seen, but that's not a bad thing.
