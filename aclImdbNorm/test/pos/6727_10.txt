i saw this film early one morning in the early 90s when i was about 12.i have been trying to find what it was and finally today i did!i remember enjoying it and being a little bit freaked out at the ending when it showed the gravestone of the young boy and his ghostly face!please could anybody let me no if i can get a copy of this as i would love to see it again.i remember the kid getting stuck down a cornish tin mine and then befriending a boy.cant remember that the kids were stuck there with miners but must have been.the boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who had died while working down there i think.
