i like movies about quirky people. "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" is maybe my all time favorite, so one can imagine i had a blast with this one. it's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. this movie is unpredictable and intense. some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple viewings (because this kind of stuff really can happen). it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. and after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse.<br /><br />the acting was phenomenal. marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. seth was great, too. the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy, though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character.<br /><br />it's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "true romance." there are two bad reviews for it up here, but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film, while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot, seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "lighthearted". this one is messed up and indie as can be, and won't let you go until the heavy climax.
