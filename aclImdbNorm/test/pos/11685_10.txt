the rise of punk music was scarcely documented on film and most people tend to focus on the happenings of other cities such as london or new york. penelope spheeris managed to preserve a snapshot of los angeles circa '79-'81 which proves a vibrant and diverse art/music community had spawned which rivalled any other. to some, the bands read like a who's who of now legendary american punk; black flag, x, circle jerks, germs, fear. purists argue that vital bands were missed (weirdos, zeros, flesheaters) and that the movie was the cause of an onslaught of suburban poseurs and macho violence. however, the issues touched upon in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence continues to be seen and heard in the cliques/fashions of today.
