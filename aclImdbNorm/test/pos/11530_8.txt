it is 1969. phoebe(camilla belle) is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19 year old sister faith(cameron diaz). faith is the doer, the truth-seeker, the fixer of all the wrongs in the world. then one day, phoebe and her mother gail(blythe danner) receive word that faith is dead. faith has killed herself. both phoebe and gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, gail mourns. phoebe can't let it go. phoebe decides to go to europe and find out what happened.<br /><br />it is now 1977. phoebe(jordana brewster) is 18 and decides to go to europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth. when alive, faith was inseparable from a man she called "wolf"(christopher eccleston). though wolf claimed not to know anything about faith's last days, phoebe convinces him to tell her everything. within days, wolf realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins phoebe on her pilgrimage to portugal.<br /><br />in the end, wolf is able to tell of faith's decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide. although angry, phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was.<br /><br />i liked this movie. i'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the red army and i was 10 in 1969. this story was familiar ground for me. i can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to canada or not to avoid the draft.<br /><br />the story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that period. camilla belle was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her. jordana brewster slid easily into the role of the older phoebe. blythe danner was the ever supportive mother, a role she is all too familiar with on american tv, unfortunately. i would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with. cameron diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. though at times, her performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a news reel. of all the characters, it was christopher eccleston's wolf, that made the most growth. when we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie, we can see he is a worldly man. he is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's injustices. in the end, he realizes the direction he and faith are headed is wrong and begins to "grow up" deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way. faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death. eccleston's wolf is the most real of all the characters.<br /><br />i recommend this movie. it was enjoyable and thought provoking. "the invisible circus" is rated tv-ma, but there is very little cursing, sex or violence in it. the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating.
