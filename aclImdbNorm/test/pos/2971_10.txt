when i first heard about this movie, i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. i noticed the music was by elton john, so i figured i had nothing to loose, so i got it. what a surprise!!! the movie was awesome. it was true love is all about. the characters (paul and michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. i recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked. i think that only made the movie more realistic. the cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director lewis gilbert
