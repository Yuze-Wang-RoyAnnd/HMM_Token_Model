i was referred to this movie by a friend. i had never heard of it but i thought it had christopher lampbert so i rented it, and come to find out that wasn't christopher lampbert it was thomas jane who was great it this film. i love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. the characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing i really wish skip woods would write and direct another movie. in my book thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the thursday. this is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in thomas jane. but this movie is very rare but i have found it in a couple of hollywood video's on vhs. so dust off the old vcr and pop in thursday because it gets pee wee's seal of approval
