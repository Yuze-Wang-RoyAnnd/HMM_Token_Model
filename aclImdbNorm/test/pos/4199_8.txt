after winning a championship fight, boxer john garfield (as johnnie bradfield) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. although his manager killed the man, mr. garfield is blamed. when the manager dies in a car crash, wearing garfield's stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. still a wanted man, garfield changes his identity to "jack dorney" and moves to an arizona ranch. there, garfield meets "the dead end kids": billy halop (as tommy), bobby jordan (as angel), leo gorcey (as spit), huntz hall (as dippy), gabriel dell (as t.b.), and bernard punsly (as milt).<br /><br />garfield bonds with the young "dead end" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "grandma rafferty" (may robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "father rafferty". garfield falls in love with halop's sister, pretty "peggy" (gloria dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. of course, garfield's past comes back to haunt him
