this is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and realities. although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions our perceptions about what is true and what is real. konkona sensharma beautifully conveys that the world mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us. within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in our world.<br /><br />here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). i absolutely loved the way aparna sen wove these commentaries into the story.<br /><br />- the references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witch-doctor ("ojha" in hindi) performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the "ghosts" sitting in mithi's brain. <br /><br />- the doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is "believed" to work <br /><br />- windows of perception - the scene about the review of anu's book. <br /><br />- the allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "maya". <br /><br />- news footage of george bush telling the whole world that there is "no doubt in his mind" that there are wmd in iraq (now, that is not as much about bush's perception, who i suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about wmd in iraq.)<br /><br />- one of the best scenes in the movie is where mithi tells anu "charu sent this man to beat me" and anu dismisses it as a matter of course. konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash.<br /><br />aparna sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in god? she could have inserted some scenes about "normal", "healthy" people praying to and sacrificing for a being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history (the ritual/exorcism scene doesn't go far enough). that would be the ultimate question: what is normal? who's reality is right, the believer's or the atheist's?<br /><br />imho, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than "a beautiful mind". it looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world. if the former got 4 oscars, this deserves more - at least one each for story, screenplay, direction, konkona, and shabana azmi. it was truly a treat to watch this movie and i'm glad i bought the dvd for my collection. <br /><br />this was a story very well-told indeed.
