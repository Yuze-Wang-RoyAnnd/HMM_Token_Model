despite the pans of reviewers, i liked this movie. in fact, i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat (stuart townsend) better than cruise's attempt. all the major players from the series were present: talbot, lestat, armand, maharet, khayman, pandora, mael, marius and a half-dozen more (albeit most of them in cameo). marius, lestat and akasha were the main players (and jesse of the talamasca). also, despite other reviews, i think this movie and the music was faithful to anne rice's portrayal and ethos, at least as i perceive it. aailiyah was pretty good as akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). the movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but i thought it was a nice supplement.<br /><br />i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style, sensitivities and treatments. and i found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
