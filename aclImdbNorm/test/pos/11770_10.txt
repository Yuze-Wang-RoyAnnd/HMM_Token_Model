this is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. first off, the cast is superb. not only does it have current stars, like ryan philippe and billy bob thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like judge reinhold. it also has numerous cameos by actors like jon bon jovi, ted danson, and jamie lee curtis. second off, the story was quite good also. it was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. it takes the drug situation in the united states, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in "half baked" it has a true, life lesson image like "traffic". so watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see.
