would you like to know why french and italians love/hate each others? would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime? so, go to watch virzi's film (in original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful monica bellucci who finally speaks her native language from citt`a di castello (umbria, just at the border with tuscany). and the rest of the characters speaking livornese (lovely sabrina impacciatore and all the others). daniel auteuil definitely in his shoes with napoleon. a lot of fun, a real fresco of the elba island landscape, and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good for all times).
