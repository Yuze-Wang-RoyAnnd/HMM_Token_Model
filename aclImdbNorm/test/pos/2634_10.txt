chris penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of jeff spicoli. this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. this movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. fast times was more depressing than funny. abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life. the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle schocked in the liquor store or ben stein in his first role in the sunny's surplus store.
