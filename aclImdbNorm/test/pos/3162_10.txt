a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title. it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. i'm not sure i agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, i can't always tell exactly where he stands) but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals. most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect. i'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie. in fact, most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another. that's not to say that there aren't "characters" (real people), but except for "jim" the protagonist ( a kind of '60's drop out with an erratic state of mind) the others come and go pretty quickly. a few make a very powerful impression, especially a guru-like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself. when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving jim to the subway, it is a very powerful moment. on the cover of the dvd is the quote "the danger is clear" which is taken from president bush's speech that paved the way to our incursion into iraq. in retrospect, hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered.
