***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** well, seeing as i am a major h:lots fan, maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would. however, this movie is still excellent. it had tons of surprises, and it gave some more closure to the series. while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer, the overall feeling i felt was satisfied.
