i am not one to like those anime cartoons (eg.pokemon,dragonball z,naruto), but zatch bell is different in my opinion.zatch bell is more exciting, has better characters, and doesn't focus so much on a sort of weapon or mamodo as much as the episodes i've seen,such as it the episodes "big brother kanchome", "zatch vs. kiyo".zatch bell really focuses on the life of the strange zatch,the smart kiyo,the clueless suzy,and the weird ponygon.zatch bell is probably my fav cartoon for now,but i encourage others to watch 1 episode of it, you'll most likely will like it!<br /><br />-robbie h.
