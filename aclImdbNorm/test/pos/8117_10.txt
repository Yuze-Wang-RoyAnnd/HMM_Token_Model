i saw this film at the boston internation festival of women's cinema last night, and was saddened to hear ms. troche tell us (in her q&a after the screening) that she doesn't expect to see too much us distribution, due to her insistence on including all of the so-called "gay content". it was a fantastically entertaining comedy, and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed "the full monty", so it's really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters. wonderful cast, fabulous script, and of course, rose troche's direction make this one of the funniest films i've seen.
