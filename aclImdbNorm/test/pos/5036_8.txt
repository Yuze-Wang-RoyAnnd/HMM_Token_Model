this is one of my favorite "capra-esque" comedies. this movie is just meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. it's not religious commentary. it's fun. it's fantasy. the surprisingly negative comments (imho) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie.<br /><br />others have described travolta's role (it's the reason you'll watch the movie over and over) and the excellent supporting cast (including sparky!).<br /><br />sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes a movie is just fun.<br /><br />enjoy!
