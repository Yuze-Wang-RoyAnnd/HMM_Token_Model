***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** i loved the set-up and consistently laughed throughout the entire movie. the acting was great, with my favorite part being howard's (kevin kline) attempts to be a "manly man". the fiance and parents did a great job as a supporting cast. spoiler warning: the acting of his conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be polite were heartwarming and believable. my only problem with the end was the fact that howard was actually gay. the movie is set-up as a "be who you want to be", but the movie actually does the opposite. howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves barbra streisand's movies and enjoys dancing to music. his mannerisms and tastes appear to be gay, and it isn't until it is pointed out to him that he realizes it. rather than setting howard free, it pigeon holes him. oh, he likes to dance to music, than he must be gay. his confession at the marriage felt like a bending down to society's wishes. in the end, the movie becomes a gay rights movie, which was not the original course. it almost becomes bland with the rest. i believe the movie would had been ultimately better had howard been straight. it would have been truer to the message.
