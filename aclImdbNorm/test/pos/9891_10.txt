i understand "checking out" will likely be released in theatres in the usa in june 2006, and on dvd in november 2006. my recommendation is to not miss "checking out"!! this comedy film will entertain everyone, who will all relate to the characters, family relationships and multiple social issues that are portrayed. "checking out" will make you laugh throughout with quick fire clever humor built into almost every line, and may make you poignantly cry in a touching positive way as well. <br /><br />the subject of suicide is dealt with in a comical way, that at the same time may help people considering it understand the impacts this act may have on those their life has touched and on those who love them. lets hope that "checking out" can have a positive impact and help prevent those considering suicide from acting it out, especially in the 16-25 age group that has the highest rate of suicide in the usa. <br /><br />the script is wonderfully written, perfectly casted, and loaded with synchronicity and meaningful flashbacks in time, whose significance become more apparent throughout the film and especially at the ending. i believe the script is worthy of an academy award nomination for "best screenplay, play to a movie" ( the phoenix film festival honored "checking out" with a "best screenplay award" ).<br /><br />the cast is loaded with great actors that out do themselves, and have a long track record of great performances, acting award nominations and wins. i feel peter falk's performance in "checking out" is worthy of an academy award nomination, and is the most challenging and wide ranging of his career. laura san giacomo's performance and chemistry with peter falk as her father is masterful, and was recognized at the palm beach international film festival with a "best actress award."<br /><br />even the teenage characters in the movie shine and are played by young acting phenoms dan byrd ( movies: a cinderalla story with hilary duff; 3 young artist award nominations, won 1 ) and mary elizabeth winstead ( tv: monster island, wolf lake, passions, touched by an angel; 2 young star nominations ).<br /><br />director jeff hare and producer mark lane wonderfully develop the characters, their interrelationships, and the story line of this entertaining, enjoyable yet complex script.<br /><br />the film editing keeps the pace of the film moving quickly, only appropriately slowing in the poignant scenes, so that the audience will never loose interest from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />don't miss this film that you can take the whole family to see and all will enjoy it.
