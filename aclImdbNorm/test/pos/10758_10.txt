went to the premiere at the tribeca film festival in nyc and i absolutely loved the film!!! i am diane's #1 biggest fan and of course, as always, she gave a magnificent performance!! i have seen every single one of her movies and i must say that this is one of my new favorites. diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away. donald sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious. anton yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing performance. all in all, i recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie. 10 thumbs up!!! i would definitely go see it again and again and again. this is the best film of the year so far!!!
