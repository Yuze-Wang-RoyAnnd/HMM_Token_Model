there is only one film i can think of that might be as good or better than this one when it comes to bugs bunny and daffy duck--ali baba bunny. however, determining which is the best is irrelevant--just watch them both and enjoy.<br /><br />i compared this to ali baba bunny because both feature daffy at his absolute worst--greedy, nasty and very funny in the process. however, i think i prefer rabbit seasoning simply because bugs is also pretty awful in this one--doing horrible things right back to daffy every time daffy tries a dirty trick.<br /><br />the film begins with daffy leaving rabbit tracks right up to bugs' hole in the hope that a hunter (naturally, it's elmer) will blast the rabbit and leave daffy alone! not to be outdone, bugs time and again takes all of daffy's tricks and turns them around--and in most cases it involves daffy getting shot in the face! it's all very, very clever and funny and i don't care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh unless you are a grouch. i especially love the great and unexpected ending, but i won't say more, as i don't want to spoil the surprise.
