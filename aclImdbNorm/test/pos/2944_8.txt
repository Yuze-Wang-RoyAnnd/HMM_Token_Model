this film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. i'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. great acting, directing - and it is canadian to boot! it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord! it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way - without cheaply capitalizing on all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks.
