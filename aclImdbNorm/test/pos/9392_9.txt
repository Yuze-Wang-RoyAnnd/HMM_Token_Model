george barry is a genius. "death bed: the bed that eats" is a prototype for much of the 'slipstream' fiction and camp surrealism that is so chic now. truly innovative, maverick, and just effing brilliant. hyper-strange acting, subtly nightmarish atmosphere. i recommend reading stephen thrower's book "nightmare usa" (there is a chapter devoted to barry and "death bed: the bed that eats"). available from fab press. on a related note, "death bed: the bed that eats" and "beyond dream's door" make a perfect double-bill. furthermore, it's trite and tired - and ultimately stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film for being 'poorly made' or 'technically inept.' the b-movie aesthetic is part of these films' charm. no amount of cgi could duplicate the cumulative effect "death bed: the bed that eats" has on the viewer with an advanced palate.
