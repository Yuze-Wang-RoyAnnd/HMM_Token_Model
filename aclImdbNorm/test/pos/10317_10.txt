not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted, i will only say this: <br /><br />nearly everybody says they loved curly best... but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts. <br /><br />i think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable.<br /><br />the off-key singing student... christine mcintire's "cousin basil" routine, and of course emil sitka's j.p. are highlights, but only around the stooges' impeccable timing and the great writing too!<br /><br />nuff said.
