this movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. the movie was cool,despite the fact, i hate new ones! all of the cast was awesome . it has great cast and an awesome plot!! the main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh?!dennis quaid is the man who is "d.o.a"(in other words dead on arrival).he finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect!!dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him. the movie is quite fast and full of action. you can see two other big stars in meg ryan(city of angels,courage under fire) and daniel stern(home alone, very bad things,bushwhacked) in supporting roles in this awesome ,cool remake of a classic movie!!
