christopher nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did "memento," and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. he uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.<br /><br />bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. one day, he follows this man, cobb, who turns the tables and confronts bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. <br /><br />cobb is a burglar and he takes bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes. both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. <br /><br />but there's an ulterior motive for cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end. no, i won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and i'm beginning to think christopher nolan is a genius.<br /><br />if you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.
