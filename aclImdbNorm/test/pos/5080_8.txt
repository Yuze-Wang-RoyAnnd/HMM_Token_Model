imagine you have just been on a plane for 18 hours. you have been on a business trip to south africa. you are a high-paid professional. you've lived in the us for 20 years. you are in your thirties, you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way. one thing, even though you have a green card, you are still egyptian. on transit you are asked to come with 2 security guards, next thing you know you are overpowered, hooded and chained and after a brief ( but still reasonably civil) interrogation you are to be rendered! this is what happens to anwar el ibrahimi at the beginning of the movie. his is a story of pain and ( literally )torture. it's one of several story lines. one follows his wife's attempts to get more information. one follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the rendition. another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of anwar el ibrahimi. there are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together. though the more famous actors like reese witherspoon ( as the distraught pregnant wife ) jake gyllenhaal ( as the cia rookie forced to watch the interrogation in northern africa) and meryl streep ( as cia hotshot corine whitman) it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it's heart. for me the actor playing the unfortunate mr el ibrahimi ( omar metwally ) was the heart and soul of this movie. his portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done. it's almost as if he was being tortured for real! also israeli actor yigal naor was very impressive as the part worried family-man and part extremely cruel chief of torture. hard to watch and not exactly fun, but still very worthwhile.
