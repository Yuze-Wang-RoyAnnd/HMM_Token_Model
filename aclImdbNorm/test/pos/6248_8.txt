slausen's lost oasis. . . a place for food, fun. . . and murder! after a guy disappears on his way to a gas station, a group of her friends head out on a trip to search for him. they come across a wax museum where they think their friend might have ended up. unfortunately for the friends, however, the owner of the roadside attraction possesses the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil. one by one, the tourists are stalked down and killed by slausen and his legion of wax dummies. can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend? following in the footsteps (and twisting them around) of the great classic wax films (house of wax, mystery of the wax museum), tourist trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style. as far as character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a basic slasher flick. but, it goes far beyond that as the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is. the acting ranges from acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from backwoods-showman mr. slausen (played by western-legend chuck connors)). the writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into the story. also, some scenes are a bit silly, like the moaning-mannequin attack on becky. it's nothing, however, that would detract from the effect of the film. as one would expect from a film about wax dummies, it is full of the endless creepiness supplied by the mannequins. it's strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can just sit still and somehow be so unsettling. . . perhaps it's the human likeness, or the blank stare, or the fact that you know it's about to spring an attack. . . whatever it is, the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the entirety of the film. as far as slashers go, it's one of the best, and it stands as one of the creepiest films i've ever seen.<br /><br />obligatory slasher elements:<br /><br />- violence/gore: the film is full of some cool deaths. the gore isn't excessive, but it's done well and leaves it as being realistic.<br /><br />- sex/nudity: there is an extended skinny-dipping scene with the very attractive lead females (though 'very attractive' barely begins to describe the ravishing future-angel tanya roberts) but it's all a tease as the girls remain mostly underwater. they do remain scantily clad throughout the film, however.<br /><br />- cool killer(s): creepy is just the beginning of slausen and his mannequins. one of the best killers in the slasher subgenre.<br /><br />- scares/suspense: from the opening scene on, the film maintains a great blend of the creepiness of the mannequins, jump scares from the attacks, and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation. . . it's all very well done to make for a genuinely scary film.<br /><br />- mystery: well, mystery wasn't really the point of the film. . . just the meaning behind all of it is what matters.<br /><br />- awkward dance scene: all these cute girls and not a single dance. shame.<br /><br />final verdict: 8/10. see this creepy slasher!<br /><br />-ap3-
