"lifeforce" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel "the space vampires" by colin wilson, scripted by dan o'bannon & don jakoby. a joint american-british space exploration team makes a mind-boggling discovery: an alien spacecraft resting inside halleys' comet, containing three entities that look like people, one of them a female beauty (the oh-so-alluring mathilda may).<br /><br />they take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft. big mistake.<br /><br />it turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings, and as american colonel carlsen (an intense, edgy, and committed steve railsback) and british s.a.s. colonel caine (a solid peter firth) watch in horror, an infestation of vampirism overtakes london, with the fate of earth in the balance.<br /><br />this picture certainly is not lacking in imagination. it moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and eye-popping visuals that it's hard not to be amused. the first of director tobe hoopers' three-picture deal with cannon films (he followed it up with "texas chainsaw massacre ii" and the "invaders from mars" remake), he makes it something truly unique. incorporating elements of sci-fi, vampire films, zombie films, and end-of-the-world sagas, it's like nothing that i've seen before.<br /><br />railsback and firth are ably supported by such strong brit actors as frank finlay, patrick stewart, michael gothard, aubrey morris, and john hallam. mathilda may is very memorable as the bewitching, enigmatic villainess; it certainly doesn't hurt that she performs a great deal of her scenes in the nude. also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than "pink panther" composer henry mancini.<br /><br />ridiculous it may be, but i found it to be fun as well. it's flamboyant and spirited entertainment.<br /><br />8/10
