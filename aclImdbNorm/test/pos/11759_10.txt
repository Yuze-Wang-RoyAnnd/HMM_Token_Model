homegrown is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks, but deserves better. when i first saw it, i had a luke-warm reaction. but, over time, it's really grown on me--no pun intended ;-). the more i see it, the more i appreciate it. the writing is top-notch, as is the acting. throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction, and you end up with a great little film.<br /><br />it's also good to finally see hank azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role. and thornton delivers his usual quality performance. even relative newcomer ryan phillippe delivers, playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety.<br /><br />on a side note, homegrown is simply a "must see" if you're a billy bob thornton fan. it appears stephen gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier thornton projects like one false move and sling blade (though homegrown is certainly a lot more tongue-in-cheek than either). and thornton's role as a character who is both sophisticated and down-to-earth is a perfect match for the actor.
