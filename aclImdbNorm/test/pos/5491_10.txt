i have seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! there are very few films which i even consider watching several times and this is one of them. everything in this movie is just right: clint as the superb leading actor, rene russo as his non-stupid female partner(this is a very rare combination - sad,but true!). of course, john malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook eastwood`s initial buddy, played by dylan mcdermott, who in my view fits the role perfectly.the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but sadly never released on an original soundtrack cd (shame on the producers!). the plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between eastwood and malkowich. i give this one 10 stars!
