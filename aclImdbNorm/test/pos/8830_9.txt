i'd first heard of this show in 2005, first online and then by viewing (and of course, buying)the typically gorgeous, bbc tie-in book. then i got the dvd; it did not disappoint! i'd been hoping for years someone would make a science fiction program with the emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens, laser gun fights and other hollywood 'boogieman' gimmicks! thank you, joe ahearne (also for your dr. who work, and ultraviolet--the mini-series; not the crap movie of the same name)! what compelled me to write this now (2 yrs. later) was that i'd just seen sunshine last night. and what appeared to be in the same family as space odyssey turned into (about 2/3rds of the way in) freddy krueger meets 2010! that was when space odyssey really stood out as a positive example of how to do a real science fiction film; more science, less fiction! odyssey (like sunshine) also dealt with astronaut shortcomings (zoe's failed eva, ivan's over exertions on venus, the spats with mission control) and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers (the fatal radiation spike on mars). i would've easily paid to see this in a theater (i-max, anyone?). and to top it all, not only were the space vistas jaw droppingly beautiful, but the characters were nicely drawn, too. i found their interplay more realistic than the wall-slamming histrionics of sunshine's icarus 2 crew (icarus; dumb name for a solar mission--did anyone read the mythology of icarus??). sometimes it takes a not-so-good film to compel one to re-watch a better film. as an armchair astronaut, i'd trade my passage on icarus for a seat on pegasus any day. in all fairness, however, the visuals of sunshine are quite stunning, though, and quite memorable. which is why i was so strongly rooting for it to succeed as an honest-to-goodness sci-fi film. so, even though this review is almost a back-door review of sunshine, i hope it's read for what it was meant to be; strong support for a bbc telefilm that succeeds where most big-budget, bloated cinematic spectacles fail. space odyssey (a.k.a. voyage to the planets here in the states) whets the appetite for solid, science-fiction and delivers a banquet. i very much enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach as well. as for the time lag/light-speed quibbles, they are addressed, if you pay attention. where sunshine melts, odyssey keeps its cool. if you're considering going to the movies for another dose of sunshine, stay in; go for a true space odyssey instead!
