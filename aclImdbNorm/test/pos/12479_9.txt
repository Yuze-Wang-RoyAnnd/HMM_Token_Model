great artists, always suffered while they were young. i could mention mozart and beethoven, but that is not the point. <br /><br />this movie was made by h-g clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the law professions.<br /><br />its main star is louis jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming "the greatest actor" and also director of france's theater before and after wwii.<br /><br />they both had health problems. clouzot had tb while young, jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater..<br /><br />such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). one might even say that today's artists are so poor, because they had never suffered and fought for their lives.<br /><br />to me, this is the greatest of clouzot's movies. "wages of fear" is greater in "suspense", "diabolique" also has more "suspense" and a better plot and is more about "female evil".<br /><br />quai des orf`evres is more human. clouzot was falsely accused by de gaulle's entourage (mostly communists and jews) of collaboration with the nazis and banned from making films until until de gaulle left france's government in early 1946. de gaulle came back in 1958, as president.<br /><br />the main characters are all good souls: jenny l'amour may perform as a "putain" on stage, but she is not a "whore" (dictionaires make synonyms of those words, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and refuses the slight "advances from her (presumably lesbian) friend dora, the photographer.<br /><br />maurice the husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the scene of the crime. he is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love..<br /><br />antoine, the detective (interpreted by the great louis jouvet, basically a stage actor, performs in this french "gray" not noir, as well as e.g. robinson in "double indemnity") shows flair for pseudo criminals, tenderness for a negro son(?), and compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman's ch^ateau!!<br /><br />clouzot was capable of slapping an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep inside he was very human. <br /><br />i have his horoscope in front of me. he had venus in sagittarius which means open-heartedness, devotion, charity and altruism. for those who do not believe in astrology, my most sincere apologies...
