this was truly a tense and dark episode. excellently executed, wonderful acting and atmospheric directing, 'ice' is one of my favorite episodes. along with 'pusher' 'grotesque' 'wetwired' and 'home' (these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case) it seem quite realistic to me, their paranoia, their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors. however, 'ice' had a problem that i got over after a few watches: it was too short! i wanted more!<br /><br />overall, 'ice' had what 98% of all x files episodes have: excellent acting, intense story-writing, gritty directing. all the works.<br /><br />10 out of 10
