im usually wary of movies hovering around the 6/10 mark on imdb. id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like. i guess the trick with reviewing is to take an approach of "hey, if i liked types of movies like these- would i give it a higher score than i am about to give it now since i don't like these types of movies" then again people judge differently , basing more value on acting, or perhaps story or directing. anyway, landing the plane here- i had rented this movie out before and hadn't had time to watch it, this morning i did.<br /><br />wow! see this movie. i am personally interested in the paranormal/have read a bit about near death experiences, so automatically i was hooked. i am unsure about some of the comments here saying that a quality cast here was wasted - i disagree- the acting here was superb from all- i think this is the only time i didn't mind julia roberts, it was good to see 24's kiefer sutherland (currently at the time of this review, serving a jail sentence for dui), and kevin bacon sporting an interesting hair style.<br /><br />overall- i liked the direction, the atmosphere, the acting, and the story line most of all- particularly the idea of karma, and , to quote nelson wright "everything we does matters" so true.<br /><br />10/10!
