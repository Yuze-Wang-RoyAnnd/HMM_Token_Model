this movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. everything about the movie was perfect. i just saw the movie yesterday and i want to get my own dvd asap and watch it many times over. the story ends as it started i was very happy that he came back and i was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. she honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. the character had many shades. christian bale is also an phenomenal actor. some stories do have happy endings. aside from the love story angle i thought about how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its people...government makes the decision whereas the people suffer. her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams. i loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a dowry and i also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake. they were survivors.
