its really been a long time since the last time somebody created a movie such as like this on. a so called b movie. maybe it was not a great movie, but it is fun to watch, classic bruce cambell, it has its good parts, funny ones, disgusting ones, even artistic ones. <br /><br />******spoiler ahead*******<br /><br />----------------------- --------------------------------- --------------------------- -------------<br /><br />the part where his wife as a dummy-robot-avenger is about to die, i don't know about you, but it made me feel so weird, so sad and disgusted in a good way. i compare this scene with the scene form the fly 2 where his dog as a monster dies. makes you think oh my god.<br /><br />---------------- --------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ --------------------------<br /><br />********no more spoilers********* <br /><br />if you are a bruce cambell fan, you definitely wanna have this movie in your collection. if you are generally interested in movies, you might wanna. just think that the movies target is to make you smile, gross you out(don't worry not that bad though) and make you have a good time with your buddies. attention, i said buddies, not possible future girlfriend.
