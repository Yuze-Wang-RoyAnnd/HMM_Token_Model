very glad to see that this excellent film gets such high marks from the users of imdb. the best years of their lives remains the finest cinematic statement about veterans returning from war that i have come across. easily the finest performance by the often overlooked frederick march. in fact the entire cast shines, including music legend hoagy carmichael who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic lazy river. i would recommend this excellent film to anyone who loves movies.
