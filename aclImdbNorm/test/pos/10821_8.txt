was in the mood for a french film and saw this at blockbuster. what a little gem it turned out to be! not sure how i missed gregori derangere all these years, but he is fantastic. such innocence and grace! i love his face and the way he moves. isabelle adjani was hilarious--reminded me of nicole kidman's over-the-top performance in moulin rouge. she looks the same as 20 years ago...truly remarkable. gerard depardieu has not held up nearly as well, but his acting continues to amaze. he's perfect in this film. will probably buy this one, i enjoyed it so much. if you want to see another great french movie, rent joyeux noel. stunning.
