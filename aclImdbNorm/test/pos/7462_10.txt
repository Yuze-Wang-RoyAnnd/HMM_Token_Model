this is a great movie. i read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as i watched it (mainly for caroline dhavernas) it grew on me.<br /><br />it's such a nice change to see a movie where girls/young women are not punished for their sexuality. the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussions.<br /><br />some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious - and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes - which were not over the top or distasteful. the male characters in the movie were brilliant - david boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk - and what is great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him all that much. the other two younger male characters were good too, without being overbearing.<br /><br />this is one of the best movies i've seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them.
