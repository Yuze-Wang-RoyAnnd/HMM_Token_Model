i can't remember the series, i believe it may have been "american masters", but it was broadcast on pbs around 1980. most people have some knowledge of the development of the a bomb, and those that have little, or none, probably think it is a pretty dry subject. anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way. you get to know the turmoil in oppenhemiers mind, and how the development changed his life forever. you understand the tragic figure he became, and why. with 7 episodes you get to know the major players, and the intrigue and backstabbing. i have contacted pbs about the chance of obtaining a video, or dvd, but have never received a response. too bad, i would love to see it again.
