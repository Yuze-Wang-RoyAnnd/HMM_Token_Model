i haven't written a review on here in ages but rewatching all of bottom tv show, live shows and this i felt i had to make my views on this movie known! it is, i feel, the perfect comedy movie. it lacks the lovey dovey story lines(i wouldn't really call richies enfatuation with gina carbonara love would you? or him and eddie going up there naked... not love) that make the rest of comedys go from good to crap, it lacks the usual dilemmas that one must overcome in most other comedy movies... unless you count the fact that they poisoned the guests and must escape from the guests green vomit as a dilemma thats similar to other comedy movies..... no, this movie just sets out and succeeds in doing one thing and one thing only: making one laugh. what does one require from comedy movies? laughter. this movie just piles on laugh after laugh without stuffing up the laughs with serious crap like other comedy movies! thus i call it the, so far, only perfect comedy movie ever made and i will never ever stop watching this beautiful movie! i appluad rick and ade on such fantastic genius!
