even the maria montez/jon hall technicolored baubles of the '40s are eclipsed by "princess of the nile," fox's entry in hollywood's mid-'50s obsession with things egyptian (see "land of the pharoahs," "valley of the kings," etc.) pure, unadulterated, mindless hokum, lavishly produced (low-budgeted, actually, but using sets and costumes left over from "the robe," this technicolored spectacle looks like it cost millions). 71 minutes of eye-candy (the plot, having something to do with nefarious derrings-do in ancient egypt, is beside the point) offers the cinematographer and audiences the delectable sight of debra paget wearing an assortment of see-thru veils, most of which hit the ground when she shakes and shimmies thru a slave-girl production number unparalleled in film history. female moviegoers were not shortchanged: fox's handsomest young contract player, jeffrey hunter, is as photogenic as ms. paget, while michael rennie lurks around in the background, stirring up evil doings in the land of the pyramids. for those who might think paget & hunter can't act and were only hired for their physical attributes, check out their subtle, overlooked, heartbreaking work together a few years later in "white feather" (another fox production that has sadly vanished into the realm of "lost films"). "princess of the nile" still stands in a class by itself as a cheerfully mindless, breathlessly fast-paced, dazzling testament to the glories of 3-strip technicolor--and the seductive charms of ms. paget (all of 20 at the time). put this one-of-a-kind kitsch classic at the top of your "guilty pleasures" list, and enjoy. satisfaction guaranteed!
