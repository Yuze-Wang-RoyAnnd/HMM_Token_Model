you can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of "judgement"); that layer is completely uninteresting.<br /><br />or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.<br /><br />you can try to view this as a 'realistic' vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.<br /><br />or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there, either.<br /><br />where i found the value was in the superb self-reference. coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.<br /><br />brando the man was as much of a maverick as the kurtz character. the studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with kurtz's 'unsound methods', in spite of his strategic genius.<br /><br />so coppola makes a movie all about brando's greatness. to hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by storaro that only increases the actor's power. and he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. oh, yes: "the horror..." <br /><br />other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including 'being in the firefight' long before "private ryan"; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.<br /><br />don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.
