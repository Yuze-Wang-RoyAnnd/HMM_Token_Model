the title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest, like rice husks, by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains. this is a bleak tale of the destruction of the japanese soldier.<br /><br />the story is set in the closing days of the philippines campaign as a soldier with tb who returns from a hospital because since he can walk, they have no room for him. his superior officers don't want him around since he's really too sick to work or fight. abused by his officer he's sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself. they still won't take him and he's soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man's inhumanity to man at every turn.<br /><br />billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie. this isn't to say its not horrifying, it is at times, but its also darkly comic. how could it not be? here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant, people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to remain a japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you can't help but laugh. to be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedy.<br /><br />hailed as a great anti-war film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty. here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still are, quite beautiful. its a jarring sensation.<br /><br />what intriguing is that i read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of christianity. the director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks, war stinks worse and that there is, ultimately no hope.<br /><br />intellectually i admire the film, emotionally i don't. part of it is a strident downbeat score which, for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen. its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesn't really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another.<br /><br />is it a great film, thats for you to decide. for certain its unlike any other war film, bloody, horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are. this is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spades.<br /><br />definitely worth a look.
