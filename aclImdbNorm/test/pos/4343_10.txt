this classic has so many great one-liners and unintentionally hilarious scenes that i don't even know where to start. if you want advice on dating, its here. just totally ignore the person you want, and then spout out classic lines like "chicken's good...i like chicken", and before you know it you will be having a one-nighter in a basement (it's a nice basement) with a woman who is 35 years younger than you. bronson does it all in this film. he buys a car for no good reason just so he can murder two gang members...paying with "cash"......chunnng.... he buys an ice cream, simply because "this is america, isn't it", and ends up wasting someone named "the giggler - he laughs when he runs" just because he stole his camera. by the way, this "giggler" is so fast that bronson's regular pistol can't even catch up to him, he needs to order a special one just to get this elusive creep. he gets cleaned up just so he can eat a really smelly meal (stuffed cabbage) in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothing in 90 degree weather. he goes into the dentistry business. he always seems to find a crow bar when he needs one (and its the same one!). and last, but not least, he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs to blow away richie cunningham's older brother chuck who is now strung out and in dire need of a makeover. anyway, this will all make sense once you have seen this classic...all i can say is enjoy! "i owed you that one dude"
