i'm not a big fan of movie musicals. "annie" was a stage show i loved but the movie was a flop. the "phantom of the opera movies" (and i believe there were three) failed to match the weber staging. but i loved this. the dvd will take a place of honour among my "keepers." even though it's a movie adaptation, it somehow captures the flavour and the atmosphere of live theatre. bette midler, always a treat, is just exceptional in this role. there's great music, lots of laughs and even a tear or two. i've seen most of the big musicals of the eighties and nineties. somehow i missed this one so there's no comparison to make. but if it gets revived i shall be first in line for tickets! but this movie is so good, i'll be in the odd position of wondering if the stage production will measure up to the movie.
