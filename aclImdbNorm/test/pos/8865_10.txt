i am ashamed to say it, but i have to admit, the first time i saw this film was only about a year ago. after seeing it, i immediately rushed out and bought the dvd collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.<br /><br />the film is terrific on many levels. it works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche. the incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general. kurt russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of macready, and, as a direct result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all american hero". the other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.
