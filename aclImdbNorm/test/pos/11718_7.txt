i think this is one of burts top five movies, along with deliverance, smokey and the bandit, boogie nights and city heat. he also directed this one so he had a talent for that too like his buddy clint eastwood. i wish he made more films like this or even a sequel to sharkys machine than the likes of stroker ace or cannonball run ii. this is a tough, gritty cop thriller with reynolds at the top of his game. having the beautiful rachel ward in it of thorn birds fame helped too. henry silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that. the film also a great soundtrack too. i highly recommend this, wish it was on dvd in the uk, an audio commentary from reynolds would be great as well. ***7/10***
