this depiction of forlorn japanese forces in the philipines is a tour de force in the utter meaninglessness of war. it is an effective representation of japanese pacifist views after ww ii. in the movie, japanese soldiers have been left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the philipines. faced with impending starvation they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left. to call this film depressing would be something of an understatement. the viewer is left with an utterly despairing sense of life's lost value in modern combat. the final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is a worthy statement none-the-less. highly recommended.
