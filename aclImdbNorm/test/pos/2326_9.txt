"down periscope" has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs. since then, we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now.<br /><br />it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.<br /><br />the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile, alabama in 2002. a group of cub scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board.<br /><br />it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood... which is rare company.<br /><br />thanks to kelsey grammar, lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment!
