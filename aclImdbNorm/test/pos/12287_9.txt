i don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but, this mimics life's reality in so many ways, and, if you are really honest with yourself, you will resonate with it in agreement in at least a few of the scenes.<br /><br />the acting is not only believable, but convincing in a way that endears one to the characters. moreover, it's funny, without trying too hard at it.<br /><br />and, yes, i truly believe a sequel is warranted, here. see the movie, you'll understand why.<br /><br />highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
