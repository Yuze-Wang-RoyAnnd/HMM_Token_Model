...i saw this movie when it first came out in france, in my hometown, 54 years ago, i was nine, and today i still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the gatling in it firing away, the last fight between peck and the chief, and the happy end which let me take back my breath. i haven't seen it since then, and i don't know if it would be a good idea to see it again today, it was such a fabulous moment for the kid i was.
