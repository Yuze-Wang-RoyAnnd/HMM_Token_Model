uzumaki (that's japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd films i've ever watched. a town becomes obsessed and then all-consumed by the vortex pattern in some very grotesque ways. fingertips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines... just wild and crazy japanese horror. possibly as psychologically damaging as "the ring". generally not as scary as "the eye", but the imagery in this is more sickening than most of the things in "the eye". and not as gory as "the untold story"... but that isn't to say there isn't a fair amount of blood and dismemberment. seriously, if you enjoy horror films and especially asian horror - you must add this film to your list. a few parts are a little odd with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a manga comic and it shows), but it really fits. unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source ("house of the dead") this one does it perfectly. the most original film you will see... not just this year, but probably ever. recommended!
