one of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers, (there were a number of such film in the 1970's). this one is about an accident at a neuclear reactor and of the attempts to cover it up. jack lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and jane fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best.<br /><br />the events portrayed in the film are, of course, terrifying and not in the least bit far-fetched, (much of what happens here happened in real life at three mile island), and although it now looks like something a period piece it, nevertheless, highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon, (and not rubbish like "the day after tomorrow" either).
