the antiwar musical "hair" is my number one cult-movie. i do not know how many time i have seen this film in the movie-theaters and on vhs, or how many times i have listened the cd with the stunning soundtrack, and now, this masterpiece has been finally released on dvd in brazil.<br /><br />the pacifist and touching story is still amazing, a hymn of freedom, friendship and liberty of choices, and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. i do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70's and their dreams, since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's. i do not recall who won the oscar in 1979, but treat williams and john savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances. beverly d'angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper-class teenager. i have seen "hair" probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet while berger walks to the airplane singing "that's me, that's me, that's me", and i start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery. i believe this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history. my wife, my daughter and my son also love this film; therefore i can guarantee that "hair" is timeless and recommended for any audience. my vote is ten.<br /><br />title (brazil): "hair"
