'radio' is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy, nicknamed 'radio', and the football coach from the t.l. hanna high school, harold jones.<br /><br />cuba gooding, jr. is excellent as radio! i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance, specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies. ed harris is great as harold jones, but this actor is great, so this is not anything new.<br /><br />the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy, always walk around the t.l. hanna high school, without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. one day, when the football's ball is throw near him, he decides to stay with the ball, for the impatience of johnny cash, one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met. one day, cash decides to punish james, mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up.<br /><br />when coach jones discovers that horrible act, he stays angry and punish all the team, deciding for this day on to help james, who gets the nickname 'radio' because of his passion for radios in general.<br /><br />the movie shows how radio becomes an adept assistant, helping the team train despite hardships from the players, and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city. <br /><br />i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. it has a life lesson,specially showing us how a person can make a difference, even not being what we call ''normal''. radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone, and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives.
