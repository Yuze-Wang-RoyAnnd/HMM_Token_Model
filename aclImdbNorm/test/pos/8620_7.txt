the accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix. a lot of sadness. i'm sure glad that i wasn't him....another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women. but, i don't think that it was about the women, although it was to jfk jr's passion. what a shame. any loss of life is a real shame.<br /><br />seemed like a good account of his life. i recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama!
