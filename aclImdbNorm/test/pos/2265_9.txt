spoilers a jewish frodo? yep, that'll be elijah wood again.<br /><br />ever since the concluding part of "lord of the rings", elijah wood as frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young jewish american, wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. now, with "everything is illuminated" he might finally have achieved this. playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character. still, it isn't like wood does this alone. aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer liev schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer eugene hutz, wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "everything is illuminated" is a magnificent, moving piece of cinema.<br /><br />jonathan safran foer (wood), a young american jew, sets out to the ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to america. arriving in the country, jonathan meets the all talking, all dancing alex (hutz) and his racist grandfather (boris leskin). travelling across the country, the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that alex and jonathan never knew existed.<br /><br />it's a strange feeling when the film progresses into it's second chapter (it is actually divided into four overall). the first part, whilst occasionally a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. so when we are given a brief history of alex and his family in the second part, to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step. it doesn't quite work, but as the film progresses, it definitely learns it's lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passes.<br /><br />to the ultimate credit of everyone involved, as the story does continue, so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more. elijah wood is magnificent, boris leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why hollywood has never properly noticed him. most notable of all however is newcomer eugene hutz. playing an intensely troubled character, hutz is absolutely brilliant. he shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character is communicating with wood, you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level. without hutz, the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent, but with him, it hits the next level.<br /><br />as a debut work for actor turned director liev schreiber, the story is also a brilliant piece to start. a work of passion (schreiber's grandfather himself an immigrant to america), he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content, and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots, he manages to really hit home. the final half hour in particular is so beautifully created, that it's a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye. it is a moving story, and with schreiber's help, it becomes even more powerful.<br /><br />constructed with love from a passionate director, "everything is illuminated" is a beautiful piece. a road story with a difference, it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written. it's a film that everyone should see, and it is the perfect way for elijah wood to finally lay frodo to rest.
