one type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak, which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong, finally decides there is no other way. there is a great moment in this film when john parrish (glenn ford) goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter wade matlock. it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud. in my opinion the violent men is a great western, i would rank it among the best. it makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular scenery of the mountains. the women have a crucial part. caroline (may winn) is engaged to parrish, but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east. she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price. martha (barbara stanwick), is tired of helping her crippled husband lee (edward g. robinson) but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power. meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother (brian keith). her daughter judith (diane foster) is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father. parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch. like he had warned lee, "don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting".
