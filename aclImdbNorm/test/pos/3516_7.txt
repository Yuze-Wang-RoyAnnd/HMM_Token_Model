a quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. however, "jbd" delivers considerably more.<br /><br />rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. these feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil. oh yeah- george kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing? <br /><br />if you liked "wrong turn", then watch this to see where much of its' methodology came from.
