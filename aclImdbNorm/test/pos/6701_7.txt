ok, let's get this out of the way first: as a piece of cinema, lifeforce is rubbish. as a bit of cheesy entertainment for sf buffs, it's got a lot of merit. if you enjoy watching those old black and white sf b-movies - giant mutated spiders/ant or alien monsters wandering around the desert - you really will get a kick out of lifeforce.<br /><br />bad things: the story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor. good things: the special effects are halfway decent; it has a welcomingly different british centered story (it's set in london) which gives different feel to most sf movies; and it has the well-endowed mathilda may (amusingly billed as "space girl") wandering around stark naked. <br /><br />in short: it's fun. <br /><br />i've seen it half a dozen times now, and every time it comes on tv i make time to watch it - admittedly this is partly to do with the naked ms. may - but it's also to do with the enjoying a bit of unassuming and silly sf.
