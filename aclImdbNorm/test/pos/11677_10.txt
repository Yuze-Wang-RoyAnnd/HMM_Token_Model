i saw this movie in the theater when i was 14 and it changed my life. i immediately cut off my hair and began buying all of the records of the bands in the movie. these were some of the seminal bands of l.a. punk rock caught on film at the peak of their powers. bands like black flag (pre-rollins), circle jerks, fear, x, and the germs have few equals in the history of punk music. i can't believe this film has never been put out on video or dvd. great movie for fans of punk rock.
