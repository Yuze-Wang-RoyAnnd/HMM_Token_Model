i guess my husband and i are a little slow. we don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. in this case, we didn't start watching koqs until almost the 6th season. i'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. other than the fact that we are not big fans of "appointment" tv viewing. our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a dvr yet). so i guess it wasn't until tbs starting running reruns on their daily lineup in the evenings that we started watching consistently.<br /><br />by the time we got hooked, there were only a couple more season's left before the series was canceled. but we still watch it almost daily on tbs. i almost prefer to see series this way, because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and what's going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week.<br /><br />but the episodes stand alone in the since that the stories don't carry over from week to week. but that is fine with me, because you can watch an episode, then miss weeks - and still pick back up.<br /><br />my only criticism is the writing wasn't always consistent. some episodes would be outrageously hilarious, and then some would only be mildly funny. so, i'm not sure it had the quality of writers that seinfeld or raymond had. but i loved the casting and the characters are all quite believable and realistic. kevin james is just plain funny to look at! so even if the plot isn't that great, james body language and expressions make the show worth watching. leah remini is great as the "play-it-straight" wife. i think its harder to play the straight character for laughs, than the comedic character, and she does a great job. she has a knack at sarcasm and insults like no one else. she is one tough cookie! and who can forget arthur as carrie's dad, who lives with them in their basement. <br /><br />this a great series and i was sorry when it cancelled. but a big thanks to tbs for keeping the king alive in reruns!
