that's how i'd sum it up! there were other who said, naked gun meets james bond. i think mine is more accurate, but i'm not neutral on that point ... ;o) <br /><br />this movie is kind of a blast from the past. it reminds you of the old movies (from the '50s & '60s) and that's not only because it plays in that time period (1955 to be exact, with the flashback exception), but it's the mood the movie is made in and it shows on screen! the main actor here (who is as i've been told very popular in his homeland france), is perfect in his role here. he's the spy with the number 117 attached to him. there is one character who sums him up in the movie, by asking a question, about if he's good or not ... you'll see when you watch the movie! <br /><br />very funny indeed this is and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with old school flair, but not taking itself or anything else for that matter seriously, than you need to watch this! :o)
