mpaa rating pg-13<br /><br />my rating: 10 and up<br /><br />my * rating 9.5/10<br /><br />william h. macy delivers a stunning performance as the role of mr. neuman. he makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him simultaniously. the story starts out as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns that macy effortly masters. i couldn't take my eyes off this film even after it ended, and i couldn't beleive it ended when it did. a must to see.<br /><br />this paragraph may be considered a spoiler by some<br /><br />after you watch the film, look at the plot this way: the neumans are the united states as a whole, and the charactor meat loaf aday plays is the people in the united states who are anti-semetic.<br /><br />this was a very enjoyable film and would reccomend to anyone i saw in the street.
