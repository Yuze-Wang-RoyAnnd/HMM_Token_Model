this film had some very funny moments. the aforementioned feeb sketch for starters. <br /><br />the parts where rik tries to act dignified in front of his guests, looking down at them through his nose. very subtly done, especially as the guest was a toffee nosed adulterer himself.<br /><br />the scene where rik finds out that gina has a fianc'e, "ahhh. she was stringing me along all the time, the brazen hussy." with his 2 candle eyes. like as if she really fancied him. but he believed it. that's why it was so funny. great moment. <br /><br />gino was also excellent. he should have been used more as the bad man. "where are the whores i ordered!" he bellows. brilliant stuff.
