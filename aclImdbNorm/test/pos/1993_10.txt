who should watch this film? anyone who has ever taken acid, read philip k. dick, thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects, has an interest in philosophy, or likes having their sense of reality messed with. i laughed out loud at this film, just because it was so outrageous and so spot-on. this film is great. this film is cool. it is better than the matrix, by a long shot (i didn't fall asleep in existenz, for a kick off: action/special effects films bore me stupid, and despite a plausible philosophical gloss, that is exactly what the matrix is). existenz is gross, it is disturbing, and it is funny. david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff (rabid) and some works of genius too (videodrome is another one worth checking out, as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone). but this is one of my all-time favourites. i can't remember the ending- which is a good thing, cos it means i can watch it again. or perhaps i never watched this film at all. maybe it's an implanted memory. or maybe it 'really' happened to me. i don't know. at any rate, it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality, and i'm glad.
