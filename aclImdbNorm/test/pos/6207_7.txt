despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with "citizen kane": it's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. the scriptwriter, preston sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of "kane" are evident. still, it's very watchable, with a young spencer tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old spencer tracy) showing depth and authority, and colleen moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. there's also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. for all that, i was quite fascinated.
