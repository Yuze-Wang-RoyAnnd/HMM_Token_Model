if you like the 80's rock, you should definitely see this movie! i've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it!<br /><br />overall, the movie is very entertaining, provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do i find boring! it was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. i was happy to see zakk, as well as blas elias, they all delivered solid performances. i tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one, specially in the terms of the script.that could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. one thing that did bother me a bit was jennifer aniston's performance. i thought she wasn't the right person for this role,i just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend.but as the movie goes on, you somehow realize that she did a good job with this.there is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold. <br /><br />to summarize, a good and a funny movie, that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by jeff scott soto and mike matijevic!
