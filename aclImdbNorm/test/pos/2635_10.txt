this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. oh don't get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. i only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. bands that had some balls. forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and i want to die' garbage. but the movies from the 80's are the best. they were all about nonsense and just having a good time. this movie exemplifies that! party! get naked! get laid! woooooohooooo!
