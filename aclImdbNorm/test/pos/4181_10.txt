this film starts as it ends and ends as it starts. what is in the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observations, commentaries, mini stories, colour and lots more. it looks at the world and our lives and tells the monkees story from the view of the group members themselves. it also looks at television and film and makes a visual commentary. it shocks also, with scenes of war and shows how we are just pawns in a big game. it says all this and much more, but if you don't look at it objectively you won't see much more than scenes strung together to join up the music. it's the sort of film that can never get boring because it's so cleverly done.
