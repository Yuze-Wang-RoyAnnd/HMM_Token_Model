the end of suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming "peak" of the world's oil supply. as the world population grows, so does demand for oil and power. as we extract oil and power, we come to a "peak" in production. more oil is demanded, less oil is generated. the inevitable outcome is conflict, and major change. <br /><br />this film will be disturbing, and alarming if you're new to the topic. you may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim. it should be required viewing. beyond politics, beyond optimism, the math is undeniable. <br /><br />suburbia is the focus, because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets. while intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis, the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. <br /><br />peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies. this issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think. this film is a lucid, coherent look at it.
