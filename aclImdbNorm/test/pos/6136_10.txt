i have been looking for this mini-series for a very long time. i saw this movie when i was living in back in russia many years ago. i'm curious if somebody who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy. i'm willing to cover all the expenses and pay for the extra tapes or dvds. this is one of the best tv series that i have ever watched. i would recommend it to anybody who is somewhat interested in israel history and world history after wwii. i'm also trying to find a book (i have heard that its even better than the movie)however the new one costs around $50 on amazon and i have never purchased a used copy. my e-mail address is yurets777@hotmail.com thank you very much for you help.
