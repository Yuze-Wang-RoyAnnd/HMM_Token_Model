this was a funny movie. just having seeing the evil dead trilogy not a week ago (and left wanting for more), i got as many bruce campbell movies as i could, including really bad ones. this one is funny, without being exceptional, but as sure as hell original.<br /><br />i mean you've got mad scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half brain freaks, gypsies, ex kgb cab drivers, jealousy, murders of passion, love, romance, sex, action and what more, all with the same 6 actors :)<br /><br />you really have to see it and enjoy it, i can't explain it in a text box. i guess it is not so much a cult movie as evil dead was, but it certainly has that bruce campbell touch i love. ted raimi lends a hand, tamara gorski looks both beautiful and interesting (she has gone a long way from the hooker in friday the 13th) and vladimir kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor, although he will probably be cast as secondary character in hollywood movies his entire career.<br /><br />bottom line: funny movie. if you liked evil dead you'll like this, too.
