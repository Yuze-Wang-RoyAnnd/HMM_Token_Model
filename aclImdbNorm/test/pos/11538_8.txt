i've never really been sure whether i liked this documentary or not. it was shown on channel 4 before a cut down version of revelations, and is on the revelations video tape before the uncut show. the documentary is basically friends of bill saying how great he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in, a bit like a trailer for the film you're about to watch. it also features david letterman grovelling like a worm for dumping bill off the his show before he died, the reason? bill made a joke about how pro-life people should picket funerals, and letterman had pro-life advertising. anyway look out for the video as revelations is bill at his ranting best :)
