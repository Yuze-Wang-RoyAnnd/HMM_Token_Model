i absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: i am from romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on usa tv i check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. i can not believe how deep i am in this show. i become to know absolutely everything about them i looked on the internet what's rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: rory is also leigh and lorelay is victoria. i can not understand why but my boyfriend does not like them and i try and try to make him see how wonderful they are but without success, but he does understand me and lets me be with my "obsesion" with the gilmore girls. i adore them. i really hope that if someone see's this will give them a try : you won't regret it
