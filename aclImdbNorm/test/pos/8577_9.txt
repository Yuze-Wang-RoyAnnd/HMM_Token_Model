personally, i think the movie is pretty good. it almost rates an 8. i liked the ethnography aspect as well as the gorgeous photography. colin firth's character isn't the most likable but he does a better than decent job with the role. the heroine, played by the beautiful nia long, is a familiar film heroine in that she's trying to do what she thinks is the best for her child -- marrying a respected member of her expatriate community -- while fighting her attraction for the "bad" man -- one who's not a member of her community (the "outsider"). most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what's expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart? i don't want to give away the ending. let me just say that it's a feel-good movie with gorgeous location shots, exquisite african dress (it's worth seeing the film just for the women's brilliantly colored african clothing and headdresses), and likable characters overall. the actor who plays nia long's son is bright and adorable. the plot is a bit formulaic, but i liked the movie nonetheless. if you're a colin firth fan you must see this film. if you like chic flicks, see it. i think i'll watch it again tonight!
