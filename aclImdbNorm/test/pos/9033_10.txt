i am not a faulkner fan (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since i grew up near the author's hometown); however, i think this is an excellent movie. on par with the quality of the movie "to kill a mocking bird". if you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. it's well worth having in your permanent collection. tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series. i wish they'd play it more often. very moving.<br /><br />on a side note, the folks from oxford, mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940's. the courthouse, city hall, etc.: they're all on screen. i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings. when i saw the arch in the front of city hall, i began to get suspicious. look closely at the pennants on chick's wall: you'll see two for ole miss !
