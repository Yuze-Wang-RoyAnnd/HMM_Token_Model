nicole finn (madonna) is just being released from prison. although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia, she wants to stick around the place she was arrested. this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record. louden (griffin dunne) is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law. louden will be driving around the city anyway (in his future mother in law's rolls royce), picking up the wedding ring and a rare big, big cat for an eccentric collector. nicki, however, starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving. between big cats, taxi drivers, hit men, bridesmaids, and a wedding cake with guns, lawyer louden knows he's not in kansas anymore. is there a way out of the madness? this film is a wild trip down comedy avenue. madonna and dunneare perfect foils to each other, making their connection uproarious, as they play out their roles as an ex-con and an uptight, button-down lawyer, respectively. the script is laudable in it's ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one, and the next. everything secondary, from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes, are also quite nice. if you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy, rent this movie for them. you will both be cheerio pronto.
