although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character, this was classic h:lots. the characters, outside of mike giardello (giancarlo esposito), were true to form, and the reunion scenes of pembleton (andre braugher) and bayliss (kyle secor) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen.<br /><br />"homicide: the movie" aka "life everlasting" is a fan flick, but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. fontana, overmeyer and yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of "the best damn show on television" together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it. true to "homicide" form, there were no happy endings, such is life. that's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television. kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike.<br /><br />** i call myself a "homicidal maniac" if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood. **
