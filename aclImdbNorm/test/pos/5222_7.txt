"father hood" is an overlooked little gem of a "road movie". fine performances by halle berry, sabina lloyd and brian bonsall, two really fun "over-the-top" ones by diane ladd and michael ironside,<br /><br />and a downright outstanding one from patrick swayze. the movie is helped by an unconventional storyline, but badly undercut by it's flashback framing which results in a formulamatic, abrupt ending. "father hood" would have worked much better without these "bookends". nevertheless, the movie brings up important issues of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. as long as the foster system rewards state institutions for not placing children, such abuses will exist.<br /><br />pick this one up. it's worth the "ride."
