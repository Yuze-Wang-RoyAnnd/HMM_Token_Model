i first saw this movie when i was about 12 years old. it has been one of my favorites since... it's so perfect in all it's glory complete with awesome soundtrack, cheesy dialog, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end... i won't ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker... i just remember feeling so sad for gary! what a bunch of cool characters in this movie it's genius!!! they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesn't like...(she had a nice little body though). i can't believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck!!! ha ha ha... when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases(almost). but a love story at heart with real problems, dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast. i love this movie !!! if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too!
