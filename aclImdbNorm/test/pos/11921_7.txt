yes, it's not a great cinematic achievement, but toy soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. the young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comedic aspects of the story, and i particularly liked shawn phelan as derek/"yogurt". i've seen this one plenty of times over the years, and will probably see it several more. just don't think too much and you'll love it - enjoy!
