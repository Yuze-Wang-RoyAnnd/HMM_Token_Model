this norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway, apparently committing suicide. but the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert. he meets a man, and is shipped off to a mysterious city, where he starts working in an aseptic modern office as an accountant. the coworkers seem nice, if guarded, he soon meets a girlfriend, yet the city seems utterly strange, as food has no taste, alcohol doesn't make you drunk, and there's nary a children around. is this a dream, or is he in paradise, or in hell?. while at times, the films looks as extended episode of the twilight zone (even at ninety minutes, the movie seems a bit long), it is quite thought provoking. the best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal, as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration, and recoil at discussing deeper issues. i always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they try to repress the basic urges of human nature. and this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style. unfortunately, the movie ends up a big long, and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it, but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing.
