this film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. it's a short tragic film. although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the "what happens next" factor. after watching it, i really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. the acting is amazing. there aren't many lines in the film so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene. both franco and miner have that element and it shows. for them (especially franco) to take the time to make this, obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that, i appreciated the film for what it was. also i'm happy i own it so i can share it with other people that would've never known it existed.
