indeed, cynthia watros is in this movie as elizabeth talking to desmond. though i'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).<br /><br />anyway, this last episode is really suspended. the ending is not so understandable. i think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.<br /><br />i just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.<br /><br />just can't wait further for season 3.
