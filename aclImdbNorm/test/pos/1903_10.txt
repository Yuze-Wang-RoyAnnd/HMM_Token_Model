dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero, who takes down the man, meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide. mind you that these women know karate, and are fine foxy ladies.<br /><br />spoiler--the end fight scene is pretty crazy, with dolemite ripping the heart out of willy green. make sure your copy is unrated.<br /><br />plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the hamburger pimp, reverend, mayor, queen bee, and others. the apparel is great, and the sets are full of 70's style. there are a few mess-ups in the production, such as boom mikes accidentally appearing, among other things, but that adds to the charm and laughs.<br /><br />i would recommend drinking a 6-pack before and during this movie, and keeping squares and the man a far distance away.
