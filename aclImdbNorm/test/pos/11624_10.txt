i first saw all the rivers run on tv when i was a kid and loved it. it was great seeing a mini-series that was set and filmed in a place so close to home. living fairly close to echuca, i loved going to the historic port to see the paddle steamers. the first one i ever had a ride on was the pevensy(philadelphia in the movie). i love how it takes its time to let the events unfold. nothing feels rushed as most movies are today. the acting was fantastic. all the rivers run was perfectly cast and i just love the crew of the philadelphia. mac is always amusing to watch with his trademark raw onion sandwich after a big night out. easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorites mini-series of all time along with the dirtwater dynasty.
