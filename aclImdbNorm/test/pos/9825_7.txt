i read the other comments here about this movie before watching it. if you've read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. i really don't understand that. i admit that it is far too long (it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit). the music is often inappropriate. but, strong performances by ford and thomas are indeed enough to carry this. with all his fame as a movie star, i'd forgotten that harrison ford really can act! this role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable. i find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception. thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous. this movie is never going to be on anybody's list of great flicks, but it isn't that bad. i'm glad that i waited to see it on video, but it is worth the $3 or $4.
