spoiler--<br /><br />in 1993, african-american director/actor mario van peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film new jack city with "posse". the film was co-written and directed by van peebles, who also stars as the main character, jessie lee.<br /><br />plot: the film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the united states was embroiled in the spanish-american war. apparently a time when the u.s. justice system could send convicts into military service, jessie lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in cuba. some of his compatriots include little j (stephen baldwin), fast-talking weezie (charles lane) and the towering-but-simple obobo (tiny lister). they find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it. however, the ambitious, bigoted colonel graham (zane) finds out about the gold, and is apparently willing to kill jessie lee and company for it. a shootout between the graham's forces and jessie lee's leaves the colonel blind in one eye, and his forces retreat. jessie lee's ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves (and the gold) back to new orleans, but it turns out that graham isn't far behind. jessie lee and his allies are forced to go on the run, heading west, to a town called freemanville. apparently, freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the civil war. jessie lee's father, "king david", was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the town. however, as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks, king david was soon brutally murdered by a white mob, in a parallel of the ku klux klan terror campaigns that began around the same time. jessie lee and company eventually find their way to freemanville, only to find that the townsfolk aren't exactly glad to see him
