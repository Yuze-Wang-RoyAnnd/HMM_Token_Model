while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, i think it is better than most over all. i mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling. it's not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. walter and jack had such a great chemistry together as friends/brother in-laws. just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game! :d i loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are. i'd recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one.<br /><br />7/10
