this is the fourth full-length feature film by marc recha. by the third 'les mans buides' -empty hands- i promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. but this time round the plot is completely different -a kind of homage to ramon barnils (sabadell 1940 - reus 2001) a catalan journalist-. the visuals in the trailer are stunning -a gleaming river bathed in sunlight- and the promise that marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother -none of both professional actors- convinced me at last, six weeks after its release. abandon yourself in this very unusual road/river film. learn almost nothing about ramon barnils but his most poignant legacy: his constant fight against amnesia of what we catalans chose to forget. 'la batalla de l'ebre' -look for battle of the ebro at the wikipedia- was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the spanish civil war and those who fought it. this film is about the lonely people roaming the same places with very little conscience of what took place there 70 years ago. this film is about the landscape.
