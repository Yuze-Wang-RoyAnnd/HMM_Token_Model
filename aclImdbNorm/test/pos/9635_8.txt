ok...ths film (like segal's last few films) once again goes beyond the "knock 'em down, kick 'em in the groin, shoot 'em in the face, get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sister's niece's cousin" stuff seagal was into for a while. geepers, steven started thinking, and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them. sure....there is plenty of action in this flick, but also some thought and heart. it's not an oscar flick, but well worth the effort, unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second. it's worth a rental..or two!!
