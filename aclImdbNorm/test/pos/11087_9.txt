this moving was intriguing and absorbing; however, the story was a little choppy and hard to follow at times. although the two principal actors did a great job, just seeing senn penn acting with every fiber of his being and stealing every frame made this a very memorable movie. later movies have revealed him to be a not just one-role actor: he also showed comedic flair in sweet and lowdown. surprisingly talented and not the light-weight i used to think he was./
