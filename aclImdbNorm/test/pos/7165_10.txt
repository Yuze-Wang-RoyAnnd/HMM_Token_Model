one unfortunate reality of post-soviet russia was that the people's welfare didn't change much from soviet times. as we see in "window to paris", most people are still as depressed as ever, while they are encouraged to go after money.<br /><br />then, everything changes for music teacher nikolai chizhov (sergei dontsov) after he finds a window that leads to paris. he and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find. this movie has one of the funniest discussions of elvis presley and edith piaf that i've ever heard. so watch this movie. you're sure to love it. it's sort of a precursor to "being john malkovich".
