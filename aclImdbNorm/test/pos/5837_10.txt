oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time! the best word to describe it is "genius"! the writing, the acting, the story lines .. everything about this show is absolutely amazing! <br /><br />i just discovered the show and i became addicted to it right away and i was really surprised that it hasn't gotten the recognition it truly deserves. it is violent, and most of the characters aren't meant for you to like them, but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look past the violence and the criminals and see them as real people. they are the lowest forms of scum, but it still finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of the characters and even care about their stories.<br /><br />the violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible, but the show isn't about the violence like some people might believe. it really is a work of art and i'm sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as much as i do.
