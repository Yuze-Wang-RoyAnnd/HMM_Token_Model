this is a great show despite many negative user reviews. the aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. simple. the fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal. <br /><br />some appear to hate the show for various reasons, but i think, they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to pick up chicks. well it is not, it is a comedy show, and the whole point of it is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. if you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't watch it. if you don't like the whole clubbing thing, don't watch it. if you don't like socializing don't watch it. this show is a comical show. if you down by watching others pick up girls, well its not making you laugh, so don't watch it. if you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to "pick-up" girls, there is no reason to hate the show, simply don't watch it!
