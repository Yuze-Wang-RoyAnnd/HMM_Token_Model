a great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later - a yugoslavian immigrant in love with the american dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality; a prematurely balding undertaker's son; a soldier; and the crazy hippy girl they all love. good direction and a strong cast do justice to steve tesich's brilliant script; the dialogue isn't as snappy as in "breaking away", but the themes of growing up and father-son conflict are dealt with just as well, and there are still a few wonderfully comic moments among the shocks and drama.
