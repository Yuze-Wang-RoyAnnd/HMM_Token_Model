i think that this film is one of the funniest films i have ever seen. i think debbie reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry between her and glenn ford is perfect. there is not a dull moment in the film and debbie looks beautiful as always. <br /><br />the story is about a showgirl maggie(debbie reynolds) who meets a penniless soldier joe (glenn ford). she takes an instant dislike to him but after he accidentally tears her dress, he returns it to her on the condition that she goes on one date with him. they end up getting married the night they have their date after just one kiss. joe and maggie move to spain and find they have nothing in common but physical attraction, so maggie proposes that for one month they live but not as man and wife which means that joe is not allowed to kiss or sleep with maggie, much to joe's frustration.a hilarious plot and a wonderful film. not to be missed.
