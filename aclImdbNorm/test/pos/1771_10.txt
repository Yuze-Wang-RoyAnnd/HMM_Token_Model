i saw this movie when i was very young living in houston, texas. i really enjoyed this movie, and i wrote to jean peters in hollywood, and i told her how much i enjoyed seeing her in this movie. she sent me an autographed photo. this movie was directed by jacques tourneur, and besides jean peters in the starring role. it also stars louis jourdan, debra paget, and herbert marshall. it was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. jean peters was married to howard hughes. she also starred in "viva zapata" with marlon brando, anthony quinn, who won an oscar for playing the role zapata's brother (marlon brando starred as zapata) (1952). and she also starred in "captain from castile" (1947) with tyron power. since then i've been trying to find a place where it is available, but so far i have not been successful. does anybody have any suggestions about where i can find and purchase this movie? it this comment contains spoilers, i am unaware of it.
