of the two slaughter movies, this is the better and even though its hardly a schindlers list in complexity it is bloody funny. all the men are the goodies or the baddies and the women are all just hos and emotionally needy, eg slaughters girl. it is also bloody funny and the pro has got to be the funniest movie pimp of all time, you just can't get enough of those hats, purple suits, gold chains and jive patois forever. the best bit is where he has the harem around him going "do you bitches unnastan". everything about him is larger than life and it is reminescent of morris day in purple rain. jim brown also proves hes a private dick for all the chicks and again he kicks whitey ass in every direction. the car scene is very unrealistic that they survive it unscathed, but hey this is the movies. definitely the finest blax flick and it surpasses shaft (1971). even the first movie is pretty good.
