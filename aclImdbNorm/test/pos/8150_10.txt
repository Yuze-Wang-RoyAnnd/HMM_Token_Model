i watched it last night and again this morning - that's how much i liked it. there is something about this movie... when the movie was almost over, i was about to cry. i would strongly recommend "latter days" to my friends - it's definitely worth seeing! i agree with those who say that some parts of the movie do not look very realistic. for example, both main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape (although, round is also a type of shape:) ). i rarely meet people like this as singles and i have never met any in couples. other parts of the movie, including all those "coincidences", do not look very realistic as well. but, after all it is a movie, not a life story.
