"two hands" is an entertaining, funny story about australian lowlifes. the screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. in a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. the forces of fate and circumstance take jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.<br /><br />the clueless jimmy, portrayed with acumen by heath ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity. the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses. the love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau.<br /><br />the film is well-directed and well-acted. the band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable, keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film.
