fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plot-wise and the acting of those who dubbed the voices is almost universally bad, but the premise is engaging, the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite amusing. it's a shame the story is such a wreck. there are a couple of places where i had no idea what just happened, it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how you'd got there. the movie is poor at explaining things and some things don't make a lot of sense, but the movie moves along breezily so its flaws barely register. not a great movie by any means, but definitely a fun one.
