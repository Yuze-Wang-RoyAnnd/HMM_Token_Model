paul mazursky's tempest - interesting,odd and strange movie about a mid-life crisis.set in nyc and a remote greek island with john cassavettes as world renowned architect who decides to drop out.he is accompanied by his daughter(molly ringwald) and a lounge singer(susan sarandon).a beautiful transfer of this 25 year old movie on the dvd- but without any extras-not even the theatrical trailer.tons of great scenery and razor-sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip.raul julia and gena rowlands round out a strong cast.a good drama mixed with comedy and tension and near insanity.this recent dvd release is worth renting. b+
