people who say that some of what the looney tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something: they weren't originally intended for children. they were produced for the cinema, to be shown before feature films, and so they could show anything that they wanted. "tweety's s.o.s." has that bad puddy tat sylvester finding tweety aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try and get him. but two things work against sylvester: granny is vehemently protecting the canary, and sylvester easily gets seasick (we don't see him throwing up, but with his green face, they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that!). and then of course, the seemingly cute tweety has a bad-ass streak.<br /><br />it's just great to see how these cartoons weren't afraid to go all out; whatever they thought about showing, they showed. we need to understand that cartoons weren't always supposed to be cute entertainment for children. really funny.
