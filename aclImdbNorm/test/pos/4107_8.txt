this was one of my favorites as a child. my family had the 8-track tape soundtrack!! it took us years (until i was in my 20s) for us to get a video of the movie (my dad taped it from hbo or something). every summer when we go to the beach (my mom, brother, sister and i) we lay on the beach and sing all the songs from this movie!!! loved it!!!
