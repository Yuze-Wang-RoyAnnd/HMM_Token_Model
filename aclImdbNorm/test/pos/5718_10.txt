this was very energetic and well played show. i saw it back in 98 and my friends and i still joke about it. each time i watch it's always as funny as the first. i also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways. i am very much looking forward to seeing more of john's own scripts and productions. <br /><br />unfortunately i can't find it anywhere for sale, and i've done quite a lot of looking. if anyone knows a website or store to refer me to, i would very much appreciate it as i am looking for his other live performances as well. please send me a message if any of you have info on the subject. thankyou.
