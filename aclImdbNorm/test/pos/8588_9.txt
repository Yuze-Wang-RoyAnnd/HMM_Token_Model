first of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film (from belgium) had to add that lumumba was "communist." if this user indeed watched the film, the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed (by none other than belgium, the u.s., the un, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other individuals', corporations', and country's political and economic gains. even if one decides to accept that the film partakes in "revisionist history" it would be naive to assume that lumumba was communist, especially coming from the country which "granted" the congo independence, and since lumumba was elected democratically to his seat as prime minister.<br /><br />onto the film...<br /><br />this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time. depicting the struggles of the african freedom fighter, and elected prime minister's struggles as its first leader, mr. peck, does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work. and this must have been quite some task. due to the fact that most people outside of the congo and belgium likely do not know the history of lumumba and the congo, outside of some light coverage of african imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high school/secondary school (or maybe university/college level) history classes, he had his work cut out for him.<br /><br />and to to think that oliver stone's "jfk" took over 3 hours, "lumumba" runs under 2 hours. and a most engaging 115 minutes it was, as we find that his desire to not compromise with western powers (whom he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people, particularly belgium), while trying to deal with power struggles within his own borders, apparently even with some of his friends, it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did.<br /><br />this is a must see for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics, and true freedom. you will not be disappointed.
