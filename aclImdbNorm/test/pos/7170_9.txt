i thought that i wrote a comment on this movie before, but i can't find it on here. anyway, i am writing it again. i accidentally found this movie from my college's library collections. it was free to watch, so why not.<br /><br />i am certainly glad that i watched it. i love this movie. i have seen a few russian movies before, most of them have serious topics. i am surprised that this was one a good comedy. i had a great laugh while watching it. and this is a movie that i want to buy. this thing is so funny. and they are not just silly funny, those plots were very original, and well thought, so they don't seem to be silly at all. i am surprised that this movie didn't attract many viewers. this is a classic that you can watch it over and over.<br /><br />those actors were also very authentic, their acting are real, not faked. if you haven't watched it, go get a copy soon! definitely recommended.
