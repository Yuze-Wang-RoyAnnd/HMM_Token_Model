i had no expectations (never saw previews for "marigold") and enjoyed the characters, contemporary music, and sharp dancing in this light-hearted movie. even though 98% of the dialog is english (great thing for me), i wish the dvd had subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the character's accent can be difficult to understand. i wouldn't judge this movie against bollywood films, but just on it's own merits as fun entertainment (a musical people movie).<br /><br />i'm hooked on ali larter as an actress (and her interviews in the bonus material indicate she is a nice person). i have since watched this movie several times (gets better each time).
