there are many, many older movies that deserve to be transferred to the dvd format. this is surely one of them. an anthony quinn triumph! scores of movies portray the victims of nazi atrocities before and during the war, but, i don't think any of them have delved into the psyche of the victim and predator as well as this this one has. anthony quinn was truly a man for all seasons. he had the ability to portray the humblest of creatures devoid of any human vises to a creature of extreme animalism and pull it off as believable to the audiences who watched with no afterthought of what they had just witnessed! truly one of our greatest artists. he is missed.
