dan ackroyd in his prime stars as johgn burns, a mental asylum escapee who poses as his own shrink to travel out to la la land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host (charle grodin in his snarling prime) takes a vacation. along the way, ackroyd hooks up with walter matthau, a fellow nutjob, and the rest is sheer hilarity. ackroyd and matthau play off very well off one another. ackroyd's stunning real-life wife, donna dixon, is along for the ride as yet another shrink. the ending feels a bit rushed and contrived, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating, an 8. a lost '80s gem.
