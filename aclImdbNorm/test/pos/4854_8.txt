the first reviewer is right - in this movie we see ourselves, snuggling up to the majority, being agreeable, trying to stay out of trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we see how easily these very human traits, so fundamental to the functioning of society, can lead us to become complicit in a great evil.<br /><br />the story is set during world war ii, with the radio, newspapers and movies reminding us of hitler's attacks on jews to underscore the irony of the same kind of violent anti-semitism taking place in america. at times that seemed a little heavy-handed to me.<br /><br />it feels more like a play than a movie, but it's so thought-provoking that such quibbles mean little. perhaps less trivial is the fact that the entire plot hinges one one little fact that struck me as rather implausible. larry has lived an uneventful life until middle age; yet all it takes is his beginning to wear a pair of spectacles for everyone - everyone - to, at the first glance, take him for a jew. i willingly suspended disbelief because the plot kept me moving forward, but the implausibility did bother me throughout the film. (and, quite frankly, i didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a jew. larry seemed to think so because her name was "hart." and later when he married her, i don't know why his neighbours assumed she was jewish.) for the first part of the film i wondered if there were going to be elements of fantasy. larry's unassumingness seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of the grotesque. why not call the police on seeing the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbour? and i thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal - the red of the houses seemed too red, gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately overlit, generally the colours were almost crayon-like in their intensity.<br /><br />in the credits i see that it was filmed on campbell avenue and wallace avenue in toronto, so i plan to drive down there (near bloor & dufferin) today to check out the colours. really :) it was good to be reminded that the clergy at that time were often leading the evil of racism. (remember how the pope refused to speak out against hitler, seeking only to get protection for the church? it was the same pope, by the way, who, when rome was about to be liberated by american troops, requested that the first soldiers to enter the city not be black. check your history.) i don't recall ever hearing of this movie before. that's a shame. it certainly is of great interest to every thinking person, to everyone interested in american history or racism; it's one of the clearest illustrations i've ever seen of bertrand russell's dictum, "do not go with a crowd to do evil."
