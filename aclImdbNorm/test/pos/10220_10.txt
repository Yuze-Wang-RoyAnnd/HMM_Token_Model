the film 'nightbreed' is one of the best horror films i have ever seen. overall, i'm not a big fan of horror films, but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen. many horror films i've seen i've enjoyed watching, however, as they are based on horror, i know that the stories are unreal, as they are fictional, therefore i can't take them all seriously. nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films.<br /><br />this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline. most horror films i've seen are all quite fake, but because nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and geniously directed with superb acting, especially by craig sheffer (aaron boone) amazing special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogue, i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody, whatsoever, that many other horror films have. nightbreed, as well as being horror has elements of thriller, romance and action all rapped in one. if you haven't seen this film, i recommend you watch it, as i rate it a 10/10.
