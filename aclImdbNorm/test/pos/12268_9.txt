this movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. the dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.<br /><br />there are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:<br /><br />ernie merriman: (sarcastically) it must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. jane: (seriously) no, it's not, it's awful!!<br /><br />aaron: he must be good looking jane: how do you know that? aaron: no one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!<br /><br />the performances of holly hunter, albert brooks, and william hurt were absolutely brilliant! even years later, i remember this movie well. often forgotten is the wonderfully funny joan cusack! i love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. there are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. i highly recommend this film.
