i'm not a disney fan at all, but i happen to be in orlando for a friend's wedding. so my traveling partner and i went to disney for a few days. i haven't seen a good 3-d effect in, well..ever. so i usually try to stay away from these presentations. the 3-d effect in this was so good. i'm a grown man of 38, and even i wanted to try and reach out and touch. it's that good! word of advice. at the end, look to the back of the theater on the wall. put it like this...the first time i saw it, the effect wasn't working. so i told my friend..."it would have been nice if...." my friend said, "that's exactly what happens. it's not working for some reason." it's an awesome show. you will not be disappointed!!!
