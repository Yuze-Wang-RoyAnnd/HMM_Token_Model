the pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. despite my best efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. i say to hell with everyone on this. every one doesn't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end. danny aiello plays a burnt out director with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man. the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good. the interludes of stones movie are absolutely funny. "this is harry stone and today i become a man!" in all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie. plus a great cameo by little richard. hilarious! i hope that more people see this movie because 202 people is not enough for a consensus.<br /><br />-silence dogood
