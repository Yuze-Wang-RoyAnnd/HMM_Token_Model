uzumaki has a very unique story and i will never look at spirals the same way again. not really spine tingling horror, this film has a dark morose, acid trip feel to it. during certain parts, was it just me or did you see vortex visuals? the camera shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild. the bizarre supernatural feel of this film draws you in just as the title suggests. acting is done well and the town setting itself seems wrong with to begin with.<br /><br />this may take a few viewings for it to sink in. a great trippy film.
