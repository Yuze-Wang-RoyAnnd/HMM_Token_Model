semper fi! i saw "the d.i." in 1957. two-and-a-half -years later i joined the corps.<br /><br />web and company got it as right as they could in '57. boot, in '59, was more like, in fact, exactly like, the boot camp shown in "full metal jacket" - yes. a black recruit, in my training platoon, was called "snowball." i was called "stick," because i was skinny as a rail. every recruit had a nickname, some rather vile, that stuck with him through his service in the corps. getting smacked, or knocked on your ass, when you screwed-up was sop. "drop, and give me fifty," got to be ho-hum. then, it turned into,"drop, and give me two-hundred!"<br /><br />the d.i.'s were a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was a controlled sadism, and with a primary purpose of keeping us stupid mofos alive when we hit combat. 200 years of experience was ingrained in that "sadism," and everything the d.i. did, or said, had a purpose geared to his mission.<br /><br />a bad d.i. gets grunts killed. a good d.i., though seemingly the world's biggest asshole, keeps 'em alive. you can't kill the enemy if you're dead.<br /><br />in case you didn't know, the marine corps has one primary mission: kill the enemy. pfd.<br /><br />everything else is pure bravo sierra.<br /><br />mstgysgt wht, usmc (ret)
