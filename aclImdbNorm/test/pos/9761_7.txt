if you love the book, as i do, stop watching the video after jean and joe meet in australia. up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book, and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and i've enjoyed it many times. after that, the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book, i.e., how jean creates a town like alice (springs). in the early part, the major change is to make strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year old widower. this rather skews this love story, especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious, such as: in the book, he intimates to joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in australia, but in the video he gives joe no clue about jean's whereabouts or intentions. the last hour of the 5-hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book. i see no reason why they threw in a fight between joe and jean -- it is quite out of character and seems to be just an aussie dig at pommies for telling them what to do. then they bring on strachan for the wedding (instead of some three years later) -- and have him read the toast!! -- very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between jean and noel as cast in the video. the whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. these abominations take up time in the last hour, which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how jean recreates willstown as a place where she and joe can both be happy.
