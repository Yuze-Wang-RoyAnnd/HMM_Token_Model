i was enchanted by niami's debut. i hope that we'll soon see more of his work. i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours, but with a gentle european whimsey that made it fresh and fun. a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. and i thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. sandra bernhard puts in her best performance since king of comedy, while peter stormare is hilarious, and ling bai touching. see it.
