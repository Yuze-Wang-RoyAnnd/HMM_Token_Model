as a czech i am very pleased when i read these comments here. i am absolutely sure that this film is great. and what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for mr. brodsk'y. the man you can see is him and his typical attitude - to live and to resist death. he was one of great actors and we are very lucky that we he has made so many beautiful films during his life. you are lucky you could see at least one of them. enjoy.
