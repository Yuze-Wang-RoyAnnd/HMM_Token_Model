some people don't like led zeppelin, but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who don't is way unbalanced. i am the proud converter of 2 or 3 led zeppelin fans and the only reason i was able to do this is because of this dvd.<br /><br />for one, how someone can listen to "stairway to heaven" or "immigrant song" without falling in love with zeppelin is beyond me, but to play the guitar and not like page... that is like being christian and not liking jesus. my friend was like "led zeppelin sucks!" and i was like, "oh yeah, watch this!" after about 2 mins of watching page pick through "white summer/black mountain side" he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about zeppelin since.<br /><br />incase you haven't been following the running metaphor i am calling this dvd the bible of led zeppelin. held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathens.<br /><br />course there are some things missing like "over the hills and far away," a good version of "immigrant song" and i really didn't need 2 version of "whole lotta love," but what the hell, i'll take 'em.<br /><br />because there is nothing besides "the song remains the same" to compare this too i gave it a 10 and even if there were more to compare it too i still would have given it a 10.
