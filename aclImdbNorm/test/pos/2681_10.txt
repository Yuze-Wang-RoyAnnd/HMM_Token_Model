if you put seinfeld aside, this is the best comedy ever, no doubt! just great!<br /><br />"the king of queens" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. set in the working-class suburb of queens, new york, the show follows doug heffernan (kevin james), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary carrie heffernan (leah remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. <br /><br />doug and carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face, whether it's doug's fixation with food or carrie's obsession with expensive clothing. <br /><br />doug and carrie also have to deal with the third, high-maintenance member of the heffernan household - carrie's twice-widowed father, arthur spooner (jerry stiller), who lives in their basement. his constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. doug and carrie have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep arthur happy - his regular excursions with gullible dog walker holly (nicole sullivan). doug's friends deacon palmer (victor williams), spence olchin (patton oswalt) and cousin danny heffernan (gary valentine) round out the cast with their "guy" humor and diverse perspectives.<br /><br />in a manner that evokes "the honeymooners," the king of queens finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. last season alone saw doug "loaning" carrie to a wifeless deacon for help with thanksgiving dinner; the heffernans suffering through the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their house; and doug and carrie striving to copy a couple whose photos - of a more adventurous life than doug and carrie's - they accidentally took home. we also watched arthur grow jealous of a new dog that holly added to her route, and doug finding out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog rocky three times behind his back. throughout, the series showcases james' incredible physical comedy, remini's hard-edged wit, and stiller's unique comic presence.<br /><br />you can't... you shoulden't miss it!
