during the 13 years of schooling i had from kindergarten through high school, there was only one day that my class took a field trip. when i went to school, you went to school, from 8:30 until 3:30 and filed trips were not taken. but, for some reason i could not recall at this advanced age, we went to see a movie - national velvet. i do not recall the movie, so, on the eve of my 57th year, i decided to revisit it.<br /><br />it is a movie about a time that no longer exists. a time when people trusted others and didn't lock their houses. a time when people were given the benefit of the doubt. it was a time when family was the most important thing. this film shows all of that and more. it shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people.<br /><br />it would not be a bad thing for every family to view this film once in a while and discuss its message.<br /><br />it was a treat to see the young elizabeth taylor, mickey rooney at his best, the academy award-winning performance of anne revere, angela lansbury before murder, she wrote, and donald crisp, who performed for almost sixty years.<br /><br />what a movie!
