i agree with "johnlewis", who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved, i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating.<br /><br />examples : <br /><br />pierre is going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin-y ? <br /><br />pierre and his stepmother have a rather...curious relationship.<br /><br />pierre, lucie, and thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain...<br /><br />lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch, or is he ? <br /><br />and isabelle, who is she really ?? <br /><br />overall, i think it was worth my time. an interesting film, and one that makes me want to read melville.
