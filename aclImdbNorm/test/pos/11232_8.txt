when northfork debuted at the cannes film festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. while i agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), in no way was it boring. as roger ebert said, `there has never been a movie like northfork.' i usually don't agree with ebert, but for once he speaks the truth. although john sayles' sunshine state may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing that i have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the polish brothers' northfork.<br /><br />northfork is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an art-house film instead of the latest jack black movie. the plot isn't some hackneyed, cookie-cutter plot; it's just so strikingly original. a small town in montana named northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down. therefore, the entire town must be evacuated. some people, however, just don't want to leave. in a side plot, a young orphan (duel farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he's being taken care of by father harlan (nick nolte). the boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who help him out through his time of sickness.<br /><br />although much of the movie is straightforward, some of it could give david lynch a run for his money. there's odd weather patterns, a weird, wooden, huge dog thing, and symbolism that would make fellini proud. it's not as overall confusing as a lynch film, but it's still quite odd. that's what makes northfork so great: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible.<br /><br />northfork has a magical feel to it: it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it. as i said earlier, i agreed with ebert on how this movie is unlike any other. however, i disagree when he says that it is `not entertaining'. he goes on to say it's just `enthralling.' perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is, but in lieu of how slow it was, i still thought it was very entertaining, something many dramas now can't do.<br /><br />northfork may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to and through it, you'll be extremely surprised, as i was.<br /><br />my rating: 8/10<br /><br />rated pg-13 for brief sexuality.
