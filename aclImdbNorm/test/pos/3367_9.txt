i have to say that some of the other reviews of this film i have read show very little understanding of it or the original tv series it stemmed from. dad's army was a sitcom and therefore had humour and so is bound to have put a smile on the face of the dire situation. however the series carried very many serious messages such as the episode 'branded' about the bigotry and ignorance that was attached to conscientious objectors. the film was faithful to the series and was simply like an extended episode. so i'm afraid the reviewer who claimed that columbia improved the humour was quite wrong and let's face it - the bbc sitcoms of this period beat anything that came out of america hands down. also comments referring to propaganda were also way off the mark. the homeguard were people considered unfit for frontline service who still wished to serve. they were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they signed up as hitler announced that anyone who did so would be executed if and when britain was invaded. thank you for allowing me the opportunity to set the record straight as it is always good to actually speak and comment on what has been seen rather making it up as you go along i find.
