i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so i watched it, twice already, and probably will again.<br /><br />the early part is difficult to follow, but later it clears up. i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.<br /><br />some of the acting is unconvincing, but maybe that's because i was always expecting some kind of double-cross. in that case, the poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other, so it fits very well.<br /><br />the important theme is the carnival owner (assante) is laundering money for a local casino & his snake-charmer wife (dagmara dominczyk) wants to steal it. she complains to "archie" (reedus) how terrible her life is, and how he could help her get out of it.<br /><br />there are 3 or 4 plot twists (which is probably the reason for all of those loose ends), and just when you think you have solved the mystery, something else will happen.<br /><br />my 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.<br /><br />i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one, but i believe this film is worth your time.
