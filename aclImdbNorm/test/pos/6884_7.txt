yong-ki jeong's "puppet master only with scary parts" was the most recent korean horror flick i had the pleasure of watching. with the title of "inhyeongsa" in asia, this movie struck me immediately when i saw it reviewed online, with images that made me think of puppet master, childs play and other toy/doll based horror flicks in the past. but for some reason i didn't think.."boy, this will be tacky", i imagined it would be creepy and fun. toysome horror done well almost.<br /><br />the movie starts slowly, but i like that, so it was fine. the score, almost like i found with acacia, was beautiful and very much reminded me of classic horror scores of the past. i wont give much away, but the story was strong in this one, and i would highly recommend it to any fan of asian horror. it isn't extreme, it isn't to be taken with utmost seriousness, but it is really good.
