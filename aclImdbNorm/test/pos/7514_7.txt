may i never have to go to this hospital [or hospice, if i want to be politically correct] [which ass coined this asinine phrase, anyway?], for anything other than directions on how to get out of town. george c. did a masterful job playing the burned out, over worked cynic who has come to the conclusion that his life has been a waste, but is helpless to change his environment or conditions even when given a golden opportunity [which probably wasn't so golden anyway]. i got several laughs out of this brutally black comedy, however at the same time was sobered and often chilled to the marrow because i fear this very atmosphere pervades most houses of healing even as i write.
