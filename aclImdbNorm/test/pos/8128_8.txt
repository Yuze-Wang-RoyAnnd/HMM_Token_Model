an inspired choice of director for this latest brit-flick, rose troche, who burst on the scene with the budget-free tale of ny dykes, _go fish_ brings a gently jaundiced view to this tale of a londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths. the highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter-gatherers but end up ordering a take-away. the film as a whole is wonderfully acted and troche, who'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with _go fish_'s grainy hyperkinesis. a really enjoyable film
