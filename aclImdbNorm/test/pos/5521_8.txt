a man named jerry comes into possession of an ancient aztec doll.however this creepy little figure is possessed by an evil spirit,which takes over jerry's body and pushes him to spill the blood...i have seen two other horror movies "the dorm that dripped blood" and "the kindred" made by stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow and i must say that "the power" doesn't disappoint either.the plot is slow-moving,but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore.the scene of a female tabloid reporter being attacked by arms that come ripping out of a mattress is a hoot.i liked this low-budget horror movie and you should too,if you are into 80's horror genre.8 out of 10.
