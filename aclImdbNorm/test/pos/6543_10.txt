the movie has started, the wheels spin, your car has entered a race against the fox.... you're behind you can't get in front, you figure, "if i go out, i'm taking you with me..." you smash into the cars parked on the side of the road, you turn to hit fox but your aim is bad.... bang, you've gone up the back of a vw, and smash you've landed in a reservoir. your car lights on fire. you could get out if you wanted, but the shame of losing has taken you... bang! your car blows up, everyone looks on in despair, some crying... the sound of a siren tells you the cops are coming. everyone gets in their cars and bolts, leaving you to burn. the charred remains of the cars frame sits there, haunting the on lookers... you're dead.<br /><br />this is one of the scenes; actually its the first scene in the movie. there are many more like it. as you enter the cockpit of the fox in his pimped out v8 ford, terry serio in his crazy gtho, and many others in this blast from the past.... john clarks masterpiece, "running on empty" "-he'll win at any cost-"
