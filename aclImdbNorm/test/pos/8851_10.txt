people with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but the thing is far from being simply a horror classic. the fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day cgi is only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as a masterpiece. technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing, superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film justice. absolutely essential viewing.
