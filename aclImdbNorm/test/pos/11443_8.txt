night of the demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy 80's demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant evil dead and demons movies. this movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie. a definite welcome addition after the 80's were overrun by slasher flicks, it was nice to see something a little different.<br /><br />the plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a halloween party at hull house which used to be funeral parlour, hosted by angela. about 40-minutes of boozing and sexing eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the furnace and possessing each and every one of the teens. add some snazzy make-up effects, lots of gore, and cool-looking demons and you've got yourself a sweet 80's cheese-fest that would be ranked as one of the best demon-related films in many horror fans' lists.<br /><br />firstly i loved the setting for this movie, "hull house" is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons emerge, that's when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear. this movie spawned 2 sequels, the first one in 1994 which was okay but nothing come pared to this and the third one titled demon house was absolutely horrendous. this is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come.<br /><br />all in all a fun cheesy flick with demons that's definitely worth checking out.
