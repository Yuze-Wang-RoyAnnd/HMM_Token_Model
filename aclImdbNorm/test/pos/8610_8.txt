this movie is a fascinating drama about the making of a movie. the actor and the actress really can't stand each other, but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex - she for the first time, per script. the actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot, aside from she is freezing in the early scenes on a beach. the actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the director, jeanne. i could not help being drawn in to the drama of 'how are these two possibly going to act their way thru a sex scene?' that drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras. not that roxane mesquida isn't lovely and worth seeing naked! however, there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra. i think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures (2 of 9) here in imdb. i don't even know if this girl is credited, but when she walks by (fully dressed of course) in confident indifference with her short blonde hair -- she is sexy! who is this girl???
