i have seen this movie maybe a 100 times, never grow tired of it.i saw this movie the first time when i was 7 years old, and it has left a mark in my memories since then. its a enchanting love story that brings the sun out in most people, even in the darkest times. i think that this is a "must see" movie and one of anthony quinn's best performance ever. i just wish that the tv-channels would send this movie more often. it has inspired me in a good way and surly will do that to many others. if there is any actor i wanted to meet, it would have been anthony quinn. there will never be a like of him on the silver screens,,, ever. wish that anthony quinn was still alive. may god bless his soul.
