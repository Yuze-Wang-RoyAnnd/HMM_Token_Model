i haven't seen the more recent 'traffic' which is based on this, but i'd bet on this one as the better creation. i know of no other movie that has so well portrayed the intricate tragedies of the drug trade and the 'war on drugs." i've watched this one at least four times and am enjoying it again as part of masterpiece theatre's 30th anniversary presentations.
