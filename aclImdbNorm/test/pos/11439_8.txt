"the gig" is a tight, funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends that have gathered together on a regular basis to play dixieland for fun. the group unexpectedly lands a real paying job, in musician's parlance; a "gig".<br /><br />they travel to upstate ny for a two week gig at a summer resort minus one member, who bows out due to contracting cancer. at the last minute, they hire a professional to take his place. things get sticky as an over-the-hill frankie valli type attempts a comeback at the resort and tries to utilize the group as his band.<br /><br />the attitude the professional bass player gave the guys rang true. by signing up to play the two-week gig, they were taking bread out of the mouths of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family. while pop, rock, rap, country and western, and r&b stars make money off of albums. jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living. almost nobody gets rich. the guys living their dream also cost others a needed income.<br /><br />i believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some proficiency dreams about playing a paying "gig" one time or another, woody allen and kevin bacon are two popular examples of this amateur-to-professional crossover. i especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally. my mom, who was a musician, loved it.
