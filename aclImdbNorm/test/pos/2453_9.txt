this is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. the time is thanksgiving of 1972. the place is a typical suburban home somewhere in texas. the oldest son has just comeback from vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind. and the family does not know how to handle the problem. i honestly don't think i'm exaggerating when i say this is one the most heart-wrenching war films i've seen. the funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie. most of the story takes place inside a house over a period of a couple of days. but the kind of war that takes place in this home is as intense as any real battlefield action. the film does something that is difficult to accomplish; somehow, estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the entire vietnam experience. and considering the similarities between vietnam and the current invasion of iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. estevez does a magnificent job with material. he gets a lot of help from a hand-picked cast. martin sheen and kathy bates in particular are superb as the parents. a truly moving film. highly recommended
