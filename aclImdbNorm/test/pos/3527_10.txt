this completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made.very dark at times it reminds me a little famous thriller "deliverance".director jeff lieberman creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair.all actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable.so if you are searching for something creepy,try to find this little treasure.my personal rating:10 out of 10.p.s this one is even more chilling than "halloween".
