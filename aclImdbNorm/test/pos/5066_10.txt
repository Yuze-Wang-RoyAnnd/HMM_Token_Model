this was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end. maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and that's why it's being trashing so much. it could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the american pie series higher ratings.<br /><br />jake gyllenhaal is a cia analyst, not an agent, who is to observe an interrogation of an egyptian man by moroccans, not egyptians. he's not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the interrogation techniques used. this is more believable than if he were to come across as being an "old hat" at it.<br /><br />the story jumps around a bit and can be confusing, but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place. the supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie. i found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking.
