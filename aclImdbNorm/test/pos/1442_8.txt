great little ground-breaking movie (in 1955) about an important subject.<br /><br />i wasn't expecting much from sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised by it. loved kim novak! she was gorgeous!<br /><br />loved the jazz score by elmer bernstein! as great as that by lazlo schifrin for "bullitt"! i am very surprised it doesn't seem available on cd (if anyone knows about the soundtrack's availability on any other format, they should post it here somewhere!).<br /><br />preminger's direction was, as usual, borderline flawless.<br /><br />haven't read nelson algren's novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it. the subplot of frankie as a "hot" card dealer was a bit of a surprise, too, as were a few other things. but see for yourself. it's very much worth seeing...
