hong kong, the 1920s. a young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero, and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. he helps a servant girl escape from a ruthless businessman, whose goons then come after them, and terrorizes the young man's uncle's noodle restaurant. the uncle turns out to be an old, reformed triad assassin, who now helps the young guy become proficient in martial arts. it's all-out karate kid style with "wash the wok" instead of "wax on, wax off". the kung fu villain is the ruthless businessman's son, who has a trademark scorpion style that looks cool although it is quite silly and surely completely unrealistic.<br /><br />but the story, which develops over time, has an epic feel, good characterization, great kung fu and is generally very entertaining. the young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for. the romance dimension remains undeveloped, though, which is a bit disappointing. otherwise a great movie.<br /><br />my rating: 8 out of 10.
