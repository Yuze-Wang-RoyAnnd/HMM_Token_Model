i have never seen "american werewolf in london" but this movie was very entertaining. when renting it i thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects. i thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise, the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other, nice. the transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies, but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like. gore: i do believe there is too much in this movie, which really takes away from the horror, when every frame has blood in it, taking the violence seriously is hard. <br /><br />j.hurst (8th grade)
