enjoyed this film which deals entirely about an average family, so it appears. ben travis, (jeff daniels) plays the role as a father who is only interested in one son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophy's, however, he hates it very much and even his father. ben has very little to say to his other son, tim, (emile hirsh) and even his daughter, penny, (michelle williams) who is fortunate to be away in college. the mother, sandy, (sigourney weaver) tries to hold the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband also. a very tragic event happens in the family which changes everyone's personality, young and old start using drugs, smoking pot and drinking all the time at parties. there is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that sandy travis finally tells her son tim.
