hilary was great as julie, and pat was once again magnificent as mr. miyagi, but there should have been more references towards the other three movies! i mean, come on! first off, where's daniel!? miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that's it. daniel was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie. he could've helped miyagi train julie-san! on the flip side, the music stayed true to the movie though, with a little more instrumentation(fretless bass)to accompany the wonderfully played pan-flute! it doesn't feel like a karate kid movie unless you hear that pan-flute! thank you zamfir! overall, a decent movie though! we miss you noriyuki!
