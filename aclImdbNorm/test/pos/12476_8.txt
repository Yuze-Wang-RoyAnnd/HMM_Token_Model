pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case. it starts off marvelously, but kind of hits a wall at a certain point. we're sure we know what happened, then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints. still, clouzot's direction is great, and the acting is quite good. louis jouvet, who also co-starred in marcel carn'e's dr^ole de drame, gives the best performance as the clever detective. i wonder if the coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote fargo. much like that film, the police officer doesn't appear until nearly halfway through, and then he becomes almost the focus of the film. there's also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him (although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist).
