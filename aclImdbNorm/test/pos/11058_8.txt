this was my first gaspar noe movie i've watched and i have to say i was shocked. i don't mind gore in generally, but this isn't even gore , it's real butchering. for some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and i mean really disgusting. leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant. when you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given, you can't stop and take a minute to think about it. the actors did their job well, representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society. the movie is full of metaphors, but i'll let you figure them out. don't watch it if you want to have a lite, relaxing time. i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema.
