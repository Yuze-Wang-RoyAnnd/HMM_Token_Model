i saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of all-time best films ever made. when i first watched it, i was just beginning what has become a life-long passion for justice. it gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about.<br /><br />when you have a cast like this one, you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous. this is, by far, the best role i have ever seen sean penn play (along with i am sam). he nails the role, doesn't glamourize his actions while doing so. he manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that i think was very important. up until the very end, he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is. he is a sick man who regrets his past, but still makes excuses for it. he ends up able to redeem his sense of self-worth as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can through the aid of susan sarandon's character, sister helen prejean. her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them.<br /><br />the supporting cast was also top-notch. i was surprised to see a small cameo of jack black in this film given the funny-man he has become today! i loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art. and, in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far out-did the book.
