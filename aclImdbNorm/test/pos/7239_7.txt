a very bizarre bringing to the screen of william shakespeare's tragic love story.<br /><br />the que family and the capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence. the hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy. in the middle of all of this insanity are tromeo and juliet, literature's most famous "star crossed" lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to.<br /><br />the film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original, or close to original, lines. but the infamous troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end. that makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes, but it is nonetheless pretty inventive. tyrone (tybalt in shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10<br /><br />many differently edited and rated versions exist. each contains violence, profanity, drug use, and sex, all with a big dose of bizarreness.
