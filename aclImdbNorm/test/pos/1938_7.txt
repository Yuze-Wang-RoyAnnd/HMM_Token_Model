"river's edge" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw "blue velvet", you know thats saying something. viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated "kids". the previews for "kids" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. in reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. "river's edge" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better. the only times it goes from being disturbing to distasteful is the constant image of the dead nude body. outside of that, the film is thought-provoking and, for all its minor flaws, quite realistic.<br /><br />keanu reeves, known for being a particularly wooden performer, gives his best performance as a burned-out teenager. ione skye is equally sympathetic and likable. dennis hopper (on the comeback trail with this, "blue velvet", and "hoosiers") gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover. crispin glover, while always entertaining to watch, seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group. the best performance however is definitely daniel roebuck. as the murderer john, roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. its a shame he didn't become a bigger star as hes a much better actor than reeves.<br /><br />the film is overall fantastic and daring. don't mistake this for another lame john hughes clich'ed high school flick such as "the breakfast club". this is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. fans of this movie are advised to check out a canadian film from 1981 called "out of the blue", directed by dennis hopper. its another shockingly bleak examination of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, may have been an influence on "river's edge".
