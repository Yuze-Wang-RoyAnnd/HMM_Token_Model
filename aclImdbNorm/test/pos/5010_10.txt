after watching the series premiere of talk show with spike feresten i took a moment to really think wow there are actually good shows on after 12 besides snl and i was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long. his great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands. electronic lincoln was hilarious and i really think this will be a good dark horse talk show.<br /><br />i was very happy with the way he handled it and gave andy richtor some good lines to work with. as you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time slot it was very good.<br /><br />overall if you are not someone on weed or even if you are and you don't have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it.
