i really enjoyed the patriot. this movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. one line in the movie from wesley mclaren (seagal) stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society, "western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and i am in the business of curing it."<br /><br />
