kane is a killer named jacob goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. most of them die except for 3 of them. in my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. i still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. the best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the blonde girl's mouth. kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change. that was his only look the entire movie. great action and killing scenes, i don't think i could give it a full 10 out of 10, but 6 seems good.
