after seeing the aristocats: special edition in a two pack with the fox in the hound, i decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.<br /><br />the aristocats is a classic, definitely. it might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. it is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious disney classics. the aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and i think it just about succeeds.<br /><br />the storyline doesn't really make much sense and i don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak. the animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places, typical of disney's 70s films, but it does have a rustic, old fashioned charm about it.<br /><br />the aristocats strongest points are the characters, the music and the humour. the music is very memorable - try getting 'everybody wants to be a cat' out your head in a hurry! the songs are written by the sherman brothers, who also did the music for the jungle book. there was one song called 'she never felt alone' that was going to be in the film, but sadly didn't make it into the final feature. it is a shame, because i think it would have fit in very well.<br /><br />the characters are unforgettable. thomas o'malley is voiced by phil harris, and is basically baloo in a feline form. eva gabor gives duchess this warm and maternal feel and the kitten's voices actually sound like children, and not an actor imitating the voice of a child. the secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities. edgar, the 'villainous' butler plays a similar role to cruella de vil, but he's more comical than scary, often ending up in funny situations. even though he's the bad guy, he's still lovable all the same.<br /><br />the two british geese - abigail and amelia really had me cracking up, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. i also like the dogs, who tend to argue over who is 'the leader.' i could go on, but i won't spoil it. but i can tell you, the aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humour.<br /><br />the bottom line - the aristocats might not be disney's crowning achievement, or even their strongest film from the 70s (that award is a tie between the rescuers and the many adventures of whinnie the pooh). but it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain. if you are looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off watching bambi. but if you want a fun night in, the aristocats is the way to go. it is a charming and lovable film and it's impossible to dislike. enjoy! (and besides, it's good to have a film where cats aren't seen as the villains).
