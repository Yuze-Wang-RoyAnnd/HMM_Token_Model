this is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on tv. i own all 9 seasons on dvd and literally could watch them over and over. anyone who does not find this show hilarious, heartwarming, entertaining, and laugh out loud hysterical, is crazy! kevin james is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. my boyfriend and i love going to stand up comedy shows in boston (where we live) and have seen kevin james twice and his brother gary valentine (danny) once. they are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work. there are so many comedians out there that are just awful and kevin and gary really show the true side of real comedy. leah remini, although a snob and bitch in real life (so i have read) is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms. she truly makes the show...along with jerry stiller! this show is a must see and you will get addicted within one to two episodes!
