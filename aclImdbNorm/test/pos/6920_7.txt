this movie is all about entertainment. imagine your friends that you love spending time with, the ones that you know inside out becoming a bit silly and perhaps taking on a character or two. that's what this film is about. an inventive script and brilliantly performed. it's not about pleasing the masses with this one, it's about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people. which is what i'm sure they all thought when they signed up for it. <br /><br />the above review sounds completely unfair and i think that the person who wrote that was in the wrong frame of mind when they watched the film. in a lighthearted moment, there is great dignity in it if you care to look.<br /><br />a job well done, i thought it was a great film. i'd watch this before the north american norm any day.<br /><br />in a nutshell, it's not the best film you're ever going to see but it has a hell of a lot of moments. i haven't laughed that long in an age.
