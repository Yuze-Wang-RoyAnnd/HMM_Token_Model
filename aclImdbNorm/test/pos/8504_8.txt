the famous french detective henri cassin takes his first vacation in 11 years in st. margot where he meets nanette, the daughter of the vacation spot proprietors. despite nanette being promised to childhood sweetheart leon, henri and nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite nanette's father objecting due to henri's age. on the day of their wedding, leon returns and nanette runs after him. nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead, and henri swears he won't rest until he can find the killer. the only clue henri has to work with is a footprint found by leon, but he is also getting written warnings that others will die soon. soon nanette's mother is found dead and henri has no idea as to the identity of the killer. thinking himself a failure he returns to paris, then he realizes (and fears) that the killer can be only one person, even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn't really follow the formula in other of the genre by columbia or other b studios. credit to that certainly goes to director lewis who does manage to turn this into a noirish film despite the setting of the film, also aided by the use of good camera-work and lighting. geray turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance. rating, 8.
