i love horror films, but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind (the devil's backbone, the exorcist, for example). this is that kind of film, and it's not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be, it is also really beautiful. a tale of two sisters starts really slow, so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed. actually this is not a ghost story
