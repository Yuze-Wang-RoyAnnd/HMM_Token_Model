the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors. it isn't their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry either.<br /><br />to me, it is the mis-en-scene of the entire movie. the settings, the lighting, the props... all add to the mood for love between the main characters. a whiff of smoke from chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, the ever-changing tight-fitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decision-making, the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leads.<br /><br />the excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters' relationship. the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more.
