both disney and bill paxton did a fine job in conveying a story that is based in fact. you do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of one man's struggle to overcome the odds. it could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation which involves competition, though this one just happens to be related to golf. the only problem i have with the story is that i would have liked to see a bit deeper into each of the main characters, esp. mr. ouimet. mr. francis ouimet is a typical young man of his times, turn of the century america, where "class lines" are well delineated and woe be it to anyone who deigns to try to rise above his "class" standing. i did a bit of historical research and my biggest question was indeed answered, to my satisfaction. although the circumstances are a bit different than those portrayed in the film, i came away with a feeling of content. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, i believe you will too.
