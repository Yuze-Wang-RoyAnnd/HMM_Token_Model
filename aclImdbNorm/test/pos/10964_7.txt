in many ways, the filmic career of independent film-making legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock, the consummate studio director. where hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle, cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally. where every element in a hitchcock shot is composed immaculately, cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt, or what it conveyed, emotionally. hitchcock's tales were always plot-first narratives, with the human element put in the background. cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films. if some things did not make much sense logically, so be it.<br /><br />one can see this even from his very first film, 1959's shadows, filmed with a 16mm hand-held camera, on a shoe string budget of about $40,000, in manhattan, with cassavetes' acting workshop repertory company, and touted as an improvisatory film. the story is rather simple, as it follows the lives of three black sibling manhattanites- benny (ben carruthers)- a trumpeter and no account, hugh (hugh hurd)- a washed up singer, and lelia (lelia goldoni)- the younger sister of both. the film's three main arcs deal with hugh's failures as a nightclub crooner, and his friendship with his manager rupert (rupert crosse); benny's perambulations in an about manhattan with his two no account pals; and lelia's lovelife- first with a white boy tony (anthony ray), who does not realize light-skinned lelia's race, even after bedding her; then with stiff and proper davey (davey jones), who may be a misogynist.<br /><br />in the first arc, nothing much happens, except dark-skinned hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs, and opening shows for girly acts. he dreams of making it big in new york, or even paris, but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill, for the one time we actually get to hear him sing, he shows he's a marginal talent, at best. that rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work. but, this is the least important of the three arcs
