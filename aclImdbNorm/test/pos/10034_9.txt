it's true that "they died with their boots on" gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custer's (errol flynn) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn. because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the us-american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse (anthony quinn) in a favorable light. i'm almost tempted to say that "little big man" in its unqualified anti-custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison. further, one should not be mislead by the title of the picture
