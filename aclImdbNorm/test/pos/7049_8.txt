i know that was a goofy movie, but i enjoyed it immensely. it's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says "bill murray." i almost always like movies involving the underdog, and this movie has more underdogs than you can count. it's overall a kind movie--some of the adults are not wrapped tightly, but the laughter is accepting rather than brutal like so many teen movies these days. the rich kids across the lake take a beating, but no one i know minded at all. i never went to camp, but i did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the "bits" and tricks ran true. they were even understated at times, but i'm sure that was an accident.the cast performed well, with bill murray showing hints of what he would become. it's not groundhog day or broken flowers, but, hey, a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days, but then...it just doesn't matter...............................
