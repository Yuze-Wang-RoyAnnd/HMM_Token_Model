this wonderful film is a love story, and shows that not all relationships are destined to last. even so they can be great & worth the pain & suffering of breakup.<br /><br />director pieter verhoeff gives us an insight of the period around 1900, the way society (mis)treats women, and how a very strong woman (nynke) deals with. with great costumes, landscapes, lovely music and good actors and acting this photoplay draws you in for the length of the movie.<br /><br />at first the ending is a bit sudden, a page describing the rest of her life scrolls. on reflection this is a great (the best) way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life.<br /><br /> this was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles scrolled by (the first being schindler's list). apparently the movie had this effect on everybody.
