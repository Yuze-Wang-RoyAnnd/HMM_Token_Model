when you read about this film you wanna cringe. i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself! so what is the attraction here? i think that for me, it's the offbeatness of the romance. i find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this nyc jimmy-breslin-like columnist and a down-on-her-luck (health-wise) ballerina. you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman. like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint. he's a bit overweight (at least as a would-be suitor for a ballerina. hope that doesn't sound unkind) and possibly a tad too old for her. nice change of pace from greek god wooing super-model. the bill conti score has stuck in my head all these years later, which is a pretty good sign. however some of the acting is just dreadful. a subplot involving a young puerto-rican boy befriended by sorvino's character is just hilariously bad. but the opening scene where ditchburn is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story. good luck finding it. you'd think that lifetime would be re-airing this or even we, but i haven't seen it on in quite a few years.
