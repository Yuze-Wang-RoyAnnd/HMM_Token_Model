i am not a footie fan by any means but watched this with a friend as there wasn't anything else on the box at the time.(thank goodness). not only did we laugh from start to finish but about a week later in the pub, when we started discussing it, we made a right spectacle of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter. does that sloping pitch actually exist??? i have released my e-mail here so if anyone hears about it's future availability or a repeat on the telly please let me know. definitely the funniest thing i've seen on television!!! king leek was good too!! another tim healy classic
