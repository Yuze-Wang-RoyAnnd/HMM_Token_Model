michelle, anic'ee alvina, was so nice, and i really fall in love with her. she died a few months ago! friends? really the best movie of my youth. the "seasons reprise" of elton and his arranger paul buckmaster sings in my head forever... please, if you know where i could find a vhs of the film, mail me!! my husband of 26 years & i saw this as juniors in hs. yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. i think we both cried our eyes out. i think possibly we were drawn to the movie by the elton john music in it, but were then swept away by the teenage angst of it all. paul and michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie- so very easy to identify with!! it is wonderful to hear that sean is doing well, i am also in the "helping professions" (an rn). i thought his performance was good and very believable. "michelle" came across as very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. i think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the "real world" then they could be happy and continue to be in love. how many times have all of us wanted to just have a "calgon moment". if we all had no outside worries and could just deal with our "basic needs" it could be somewhat easier. i have a 15 yr old daughter and wouldn't have a problem with her seeing this movie.. kids see so much worse these days that this is very tame. for those of you who are trying to locate the cd my husband (a huge elton john fan) was able to get a 2-cd set which came out in 1992. it is called, "elton john-rare masters" polygram studios. this has all the friends songs as well as many others. as far as we know this is the only cd with the "friends" music. we also had the lp years ago and were thrilled to find the cd. good luck. i recommend this movie for anyone who loves the "young love" theme. i only wish it was on dvd now!!
