heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks. i wasn't expecting much but wow, was i ever surprised. it's a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ico for ps2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo.sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane! it's hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in 1952. also, the king was probably one of the creepiest character's i've seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, weird eyes (usually crossed), and a soft but scary voice. the only problem i had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr. wonderbird (a large talking green bird)to save them. the animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked. it's incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times, it's a real shame this is such an obscure title because it's really a good film. check it out sometime.
