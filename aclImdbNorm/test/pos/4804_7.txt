the one thing that can be said about running out of time is that it's an immensely clever film. it's interesting to note that the film's writers are french, which may explain the movie's "out of the norm" vibe, as it doesn't really fit in with what is commonly called "hong kong cinema".<br /><br />the movie concerns a thief who plans revenge on some criminal types using the assistance of an equally clever cop. but first he has to convince the cop to join his personal crusade, and so begins a series of games where the thief manuevers the cop into his plan.<br /><br />quite a clever movie.<br /><br />7 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie or full-length reviews of other foreign films)
