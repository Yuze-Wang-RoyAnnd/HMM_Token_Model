i couldn't' agree more than with the comment left by "coldshitaction" and how this film is a masterpiece. i have never seen a film that had my adrenalin flowing that this film did, and that mostly happened when bronson comes running out a fire escape with like an m-60 and plows down like 20 dude from a gang, it's genius. quite possibly the best action movie ever made (no exaggeration either), it really could be the best action movie ever made. from the start, one should know that you;re in for something sweet when the police let bronson go and tell him, tell him, to clean up the slums. once again, genius. and once again bronson is a bad ass. paul kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than john mcclain or the terminator, he's just simply a bad ass. and what else is great is the fact that he's a nice guy and buys a kid some ice cream and helps out an old couple all before he kills some scum bag. genius. highly recommended, if you hate this movie you're crazy.
