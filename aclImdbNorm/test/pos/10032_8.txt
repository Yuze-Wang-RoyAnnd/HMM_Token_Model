when one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of errol flynn and olivia dehavilland, "they died with their boots on" (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. it is the sweeping saga of general custer (flynn) - told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the luscious elizabeth bacon (dehavilland), through his tenure during the american civil war, and finally with his death at little big horn. director, raoul walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers wally kline and aeneas mackenzie, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. hence, the battle against chief crazy horse (anthony quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - california joe (charley grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land custer gave to the indians through the systematic genocide of the nation's first peoples. <br /><br />flynn, who cleverly plays custer as though he is one part arnold schwartzenegger to two parts albert schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. he literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. resident warner stock players, arthur kennedy and sidney greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.<br /><br />overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, "they died with their boots on" is ample film fodder for a saturday matin'ee or sunday night cooing with one's sweetheart. warner's dvd is pretty nice looking. although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. some fading is obvious during scene transitions. the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level.
