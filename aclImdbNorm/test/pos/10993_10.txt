in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late, this movie - in and of itself - is truly "manna from heaven"!!!<br /><br />in what could best be described as a "cute" movie, approximately 350 years of movie acting experience (allright - give or take 100 years!) joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit, remorse, and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo, ny.<br /><br />truly well-positioned to take its place in the "feel-good" movie genre, this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters' five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart, all while renewing your faith in mankind.<br /><br />from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo, ny to the final credits, the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family, anywhere. yet, somehow this particular gathering of family and "family by association" in a small, non-descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill. if you've never been to buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of "shuffling off" for a visit! shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint, down to earth tone to the film - which suits it just fine. the quiet beauty of the "queen city of the great lakes" compliments, rather than detracts from the tale that is being told. if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's "second cities" instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere, the end results would be so much more believable.<br /><br />great performances by shirley jones, frank gorshin, wendy malick, jill eickenberry, and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts hollywood's "flavor of the week" any time!<br /><br />go see this movie!<br /><br />you've wandered in hollywood's desert for too long!
