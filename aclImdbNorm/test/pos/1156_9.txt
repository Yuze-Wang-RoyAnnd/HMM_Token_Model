1904. the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto a tenuous independence, as the various european powers - france, germany, britain, russia, spain, and now the united states - are vying for influence in the region. the sultan (marc zuber) is a weak puppet; his uncle, the bashaw (vladek sheybal), who is being manipulated by the french and germans, is the real power behind the throne. enter berber chieftan raisuli (sean connery), the leader of the rif tribe and "the last of the barbary pirates", who kidnaps an american missionary, eden pedecaris (candice bergen) and her two children and takes them hostage. back in the us, president theodore roosevelt (brian keith) threatens to go to war over the issue: "pedecaris alive or raisuli dead!" - seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his "big stick" diplomacy, though secretary of state john hay (john huston) is not so confident. however, the raisuli has less sinister plans for the pedecarises, who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event.<br /><br />john milius's great historical film, based very loosely off of a true story (i.e. pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful bit of escapism. it has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material, and does not overstay its welcome like, say, "pirates of the caribbean" or the "lord of the rings" movies. it's not really an "epic" film in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made.<br /><br />while the historical context is shaky, the storyline is interesting, and as some reviewers point out, it is even more pertinent today than it was when made. as president roosevelt says, "america is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times. at the time of the film's setting, america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower, following their resounding victory in the spanish-american war - and roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove america's worth. in real life, it didn't quite work out that way, but allegorically it works well. while written from a right-wing perspective, milius's screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world. he admires roosevelt and his method of "big stick" diplomacy, and correctly recognizes (in the words of roosevelt) that while america may be feared and respected, they'll never be truly "loved" by the world, no matter what they do. and there are some scenes - like roosevelt's target shooting of european leaders and the almost-comic surprise attack by marines on the bashaw's palace - which show america's reckless and violent side, while others - the climactic showdown with the germans - show their heroism.<br /><br />the historical/political context of the film is, of course, merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing action/adventure film. there are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as raisuli's rescue of the pedecaris's from double-crossing tribesmen, which features some of the best swordplay in any film. the opening entrance of the raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces. and the final battle, which combines elements of "lawrence of arabia" and "the wild bunch", while a major historical fantasy (a three-way battle between germans, americans, and the rifs), is a superbly staged, adrenaline-pumping sequence.<br /><br />the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances. everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film, and it shows. sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a berber with a scottish accent, but manages to pull off his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern, uncivil warfare. candice bergen, an actress whom i've never been fond of, gives a fine performance as the feisty eden pedecaris, who is every bit as tough as her captor. brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr - you really feel he must have been like this, an athletic, blustering, yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self. the scenes of roosevelt boxing and target-shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest "bad ass" moments in movie history - and who can forget lines like "why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality?" john huston provides solid support as the weary, cautious hay, acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt. <br /><br />among the fine supporting cast, the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue, and steve kanaly, as the gung-ho marine captain who cheerfully advocates (and carries out) "military intervention!" as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation. other familiar faces such as vladek sheybal, nadim sawalha, roy jenson, larry cross, marc zuber, and darrell fetty also do fine work, no matter how small their role. spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saint-john ("a fistful of dynamite") as the german general and aldo sambrell as one of raisuli's tribesmen.<br /><br />"the wind and the lion" is, all around, a wonderfully done adventure film. it has something for everyone: wonderful gun- and swordplay, a lot of humor, a tough, feisty heroine (and her two cute children), a nice (if unconsummated) romance, and an interesting (if fanciful) political/historical context. it's not a masterpiece, but hey, it wasn't trying to be. i give "the wind and the lion" a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation.
