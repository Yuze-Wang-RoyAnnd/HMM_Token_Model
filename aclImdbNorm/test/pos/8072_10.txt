i didn't see such a movie where the creators put so much heart's blood into their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long time.<br /><br />everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality. camera-work, editing and compositing worked so good together it was just amazing. the titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed.<br /><br />this movie just blew me away.<br /><br />the "showdown" could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes though.<br /><br />it's a near to perfect homage to early silent noir films story, acting, scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent film-making.
