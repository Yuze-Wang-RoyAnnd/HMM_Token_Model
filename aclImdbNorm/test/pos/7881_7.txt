joe is the movie about the dark side of the force of the 1960's in america, and susan sarandon had nice boobs. this movie scared me so much when i saw it in the theatre that i never liked peter boyle until young frankenstein and was still quite leery of him even after that comedy. looking back now from today's experience, this film seems current again in being direct and to the point of half the electorate's approval of john mccain's "joe the plumber" typecast and their fear of electing a black man as president of the usa in the coming weeks. a black prez would be seen as sweet revenge of the "niggers" but bound to again bring fire to many minds if not the streets, this time by joe enthusiasts. so, the spirit of joe in the film is resurrected in the campaign of joe the plumber! still, i love to be american and be terrified at both and by the knowledge that they illustrate what ironically gregory peck said our civilized law also is: "a living, breathing reality!" god help us.
