spoilers !!! to understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior, to stay alive in real war, to think off-line,analytically,critically and not linear. otherwise you will come to false conclusions that maj.gray was dumb or unstable person. truth is something completely different. he was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by capt. o'malley is that he wants her to kill him. it was his way out. he choose it. he was not man who will retire. if you've never been on a first line you can't understand it. he intentionally prepare his own suicide. first he seduced mary jane, than intentionally acted as a dumb, than stageed argue - shutting incident before witnesses (to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial), than gave her son a bullets (to assure he could load her gun later), came that night, loaded her gun, woke her up, put her gun in her hands, acted as he was attacking her, after shot first time he raised knife and cried "one kill" so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot. he also gave her a message with his last cry. "after first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life, this is the the only way for me to die as a man, yet to be killed by somebody i love is my choice and my only prerogative, war and army is not what you thought so far, grow up finally and save your life till you can". she left military life at the end. she did understand him. and he did not die in vain. the man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was col. sam doran with help of lt. tim macy. macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do. he took photos of mary jane and maj.gray by order of col. sam doran who gave that order because maj.gray asked him to do that. after she refused to leave army (what col.doran asked her to do) col. doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder (he knew she cant be found quilty) instead of manslaughter (there was some possibility to be found quilty) with taken photos. col.doran also suppress argue-shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury. i have no doubt about outcome of that trial. why col. doran did that way? because he will do anything maj.gray ask him to do. why? because he saved his life on a battlefield. why mary jane choose to go to trial? because she was a person who have integrity, a principles. and that is why maj.gray choose her. it has to be somebody deserving, somebody honourable. keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour.<br /><br />miroslav
