i saw this movie when it aired on lifetime back in 2004. i have never seen it since then, but have thought of it often. it left such an impression on me i've been searching for it lately. i found it finally and realized it was made just for television. the movie is fabulous- filled with great writing and acting. william petersen is perfect, as always. this movie left me speechless and in tears. it's a wonderful story of faith, love, and compassion. does anybody know how i can obtain a copy of this movie for my home? is that possible with television movies?? i really would love to see it again. this is a must-have among my collection!!
