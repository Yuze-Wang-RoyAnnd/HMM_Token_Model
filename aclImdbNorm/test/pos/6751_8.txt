i found this little gem as an extra feature on my dvd of vampyr-der traum des allen grey, and didn't expect all that much from it. it looked like it might be an interesting little short though, so i turned it on.<br /><br />i am so glad that i did. it was really incredible! despite having been made more than 70 years ago, the animation was, in my view, better than some of that done today with all the computer effects and experience available now.<br /><br />the story is quite simple-a newly put together toy dog hears its owner's laments about not being able to afford an orange and goes on a quest to find her one. in the process, it runs into a toy's underworld with all sort of nefarious creatures and toys overseen by none other than the devil himself, who all want the dog's orange for themselves as well.<br /><br />this film precedes, but reminds me a lot of mad monster party? (1969, jules bass)-a movie which i have always really enjoyed-and to a lesser extent, some of tim burton's animated works-the nightmare before christmas (1993, henry selick) and corpse bride (2005, tim burton). fans of any of these movies will, i am sure, also love the mascot.<br /><br />overall, an incredible piece of short animation which is well worth watching.
