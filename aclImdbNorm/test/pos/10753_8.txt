this movie caught me by surprise. for years i have avoided many of harold lloyd's sound pictures (as well as those of keaton) because they have a generally well-deserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost. however, when i saw this film i was pleasantly surprised to find i actually liked it,...once i accepted it really was not a "harold lloyd" film (despite him starring in it). this is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films, it is highly original and lloyd isn't bad playing a totally different type of character.<br /><br />as i mentioned above, the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here. lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work, the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances, and the plot is just plain weird! instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a chinese missionary who returns to america for the first time since he was a small boy. because of this, though he looks like an american (except for his white suit and explorer's helmet), he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is chinese. in many ways, he's very naive about america and is like an innocent among wolves. early on, he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss. this boss always produces a losing candidate for the mayoral race--because he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a "token" candidate who has no chance of winning. well, the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive lloyd--he hasn't a prayer of winning! well, the unthinkable happens and lloyd wins!!! this, and lloyd's decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest lloyd. just when it appears lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge, he creates a scheme that is 100% impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks. however, despite this, it is incredibly funny and a great ending. so, my advice is at the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy.<br /><br />an important note: this movie is definitely not politically correct. the word "chink" is used repeatedly. i found it offensive but considering the times, i ignored it as you should too. if, however, you are someone who can't and like being angry, i suggest you never watch movies anyway--as you are bound to become offended again and again.
