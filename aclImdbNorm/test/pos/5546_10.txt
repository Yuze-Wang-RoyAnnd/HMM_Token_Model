this is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an overdecorated castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who's no prince. she does find her prince, but he's not that handsome. instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk-up in manhattan.<br /><br />pfeifer, stockwell and ruehl lead a cast of fully realized, if a little over-the-top, characters. <br /><br />demme reaches the highest level of movie-making in my mind. he creates a world i want to move into - a manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community.<br /><br />i wish imdb linked to reviewers' other comments. i'd like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate. i am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to "live" at least for an hour or so.
