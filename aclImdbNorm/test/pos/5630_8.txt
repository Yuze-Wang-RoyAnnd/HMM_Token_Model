i'm proud to say i'm a student at uw-milwaukee, where parts of the film were shot. yep, i recognize mitchell hall, where i took a film class, possibly the same course as fellow student smith.<br /><br />that's where i learned about "american movie." our professor told us about it shortly before its release. to be sure, i was intrigued, but for some reason, i put off seeing it for several months(it must've done pretty well if it was still playing, at least in milwaukee).<br /><br />when i finally got around to seeing it, i thought it was an entertaining documentary. it's not a masterpiece-it goes on a bit too long-but i find mark's passion and commitment inspiring. i hope this film signals the beginnings of bigger and better things him. maybe his forthcoming "northwestern" will propel him to fortune. who knows?<br /><br />rating: *** (out of ****)<br /><br />108 min/released by sony pictures classics
