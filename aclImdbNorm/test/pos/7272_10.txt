wow! i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in 'trainspotting.' this is a phenomenal movie; it has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit. when i wasn't laughing, i was at the edge of my seat. this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century. this film has everything to keep me happy!
