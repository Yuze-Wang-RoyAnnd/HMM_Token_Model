mary pickford plays annie rooney--the daughter of a cop that lives in the tough part of town. she is a rough and tumble young lady of indeterminate age (somewhere between 12 and 16) who loves to scrap but down deep has a heart of gold.<br /><br />this is a very typical style of film for mary pickford. like so many of her films, she plays a young girl--even though she was nearly 40 when she made little annie rooney. and, like so many other stories, she was both plucky and courageous. as a result, i had a strong feeling of d'ej`a vu. now if you haven't seen her other films, this isn't an issue. however, she is essentially playing a character much like the one in sparrows or daddy long legs--though these two other films are a lot better. now this isn't to say this is a bad film--just that it's certainly not among her best work--mostly due to a rather "schmaltzy" story that is very heavy on sentiment but not especially convincing. entertaining but not essential viewing unless you are a huge fan of the silents.
