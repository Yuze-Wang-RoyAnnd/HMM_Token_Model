the most amazing film i have ever seen. i didn't read the programming and i just stumbled onto the movie by accident. i thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what i saw. i only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about "punishment park" in the u.s. it felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the us if you are from europe. i must admit that i felt really anti-american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way.
