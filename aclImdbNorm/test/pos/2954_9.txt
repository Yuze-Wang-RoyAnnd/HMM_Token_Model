i always thought my father had a second life and was eagerly awaiting the development of 51 birch street when i sat down and viewed it for the first time. amazingly, this movie's journey took me to places i had not expected and made me rethink assumptions and judgments.truly a remarkable personal story told in clever but straightforward manner. i especially enjoyed the film maker's use of pulling out the type of his mother's daily diary - very effective. i read the previous comment and wish to note that the sound was fine when i watched this and suspect either the film was changed somewhat or the theater could have contributed to the poorer quality of sound for the other writer.
