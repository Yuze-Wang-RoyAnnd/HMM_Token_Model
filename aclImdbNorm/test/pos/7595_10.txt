i think that never been kissed was a totally awesome movie. the casting was really good and they acted very well. i really like drew barrymore and of course for me it was excellent. i was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video. boy, am i happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie. go see it if you already haven't!
