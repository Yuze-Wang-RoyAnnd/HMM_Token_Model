i just recently discovered this fantastic series and i just can't seem to get enough of garner's laid back pi. the shows continually display excellent level of writing and suspenseful episodes.<br /><br />this episode, sleight of hand, is a little different. forsaking humor in favor of a more serious turn for rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend.<br /><br />the mystery is great and it's unraveling is convincing enough. it's based on a book (can't remember the name) and it could easily have been stretched to a feature length episode. garner excels here as rockford gets tough and really means business. this has a "noir" feel to it all the way, the dark lighting and overall mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40's and 50's.<br /><br />really good episode in a class a series. easily deserves a 10.
