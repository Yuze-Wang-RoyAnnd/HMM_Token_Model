a true comedy.the dialog is fast and very witty.eleanor parker at her physical peak .flynn as only flynn can be"the charming rogue'..although now past his prime.. most of the scenes between the principals are short so the movie moves well. if you haven't seen this movie please give a look.you will be surprised at flynn's comedy timing.the scenes between him tucker, parker and "cudddles" sakal are hilarious.just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most attractive parker,this movie is worth a look.the romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those so inclined to watch movies from hollywood's golden past. my bet is that never say goodbye won't disappoint.
