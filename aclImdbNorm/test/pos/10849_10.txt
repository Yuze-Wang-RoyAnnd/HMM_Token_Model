when i rented this movie, i half expected it to be a low budget, plot less indy film, but thought i'd give it a try. i started watching part 1 and couldn't pull myself away till it ended 3 hours later. it was by far one of my absolute favorite films of all time. from the writing to the directing to the performances, i was laughing, crying, and singing all the way through nan astley's rite of passage from innocence to adulthood. rachael stirling is phenomenal in this film. i had never heard of her before, but now i will forever remember the vulnerability and strength i felt in her performance. she, keeley hawes, and jodhi may are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoils that most feel as they deal with an alternate form of sexuality. the fact that the film is set in the 1890's not only educates the audience about homosexuality in that time period, but makes a statement about our society today. you must see this film and, probably like myself, you'll be making a trip to the store to add it to your collection.
