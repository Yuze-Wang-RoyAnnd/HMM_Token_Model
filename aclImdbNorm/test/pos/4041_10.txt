i know the girl who did the figure skating for the lead girl. she once dated my brother and she was always really nice! i also live in cranbrook b.c, about 15 or so minutes from fort steele. haha i used to go there for field trips when i was in elementary school. it was kinda weird seeing it in the movie. i also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall.but i didn't feel like going to it at the time because i wasn't interested in acting. now i totally wish i did. this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay. it never came out here, (which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here) so i was excited when it came. i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.but if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)
