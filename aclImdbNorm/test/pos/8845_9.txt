this being my first john carpenter film, i must say i was very impressed by the thing. right from the beginning, the film draws you in, and never lets up on the tension. the film's special effects and models hold up well even today. other than kurt russell, i wasn't familiar with any of the cast members but they were all exceptional in imparting fear, paranoia, and the desperation to survive. the universal dvd has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras. strongly recommended, 9/10.
