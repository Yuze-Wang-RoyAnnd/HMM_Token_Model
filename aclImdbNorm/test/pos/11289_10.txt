e. elias merhige's existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch. this is like something alexander de large was forced to watch in "a clockwork orange." but, despite just how unwatchable this film really is, it is a success.<br /><br />if you are reading this and have not already seen the film, then it is too late. for me, at least, the payoff (after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you) was seeing the list of characters *after* the story was told. that's when the simple message hit home. but i wonder if merhige could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30, instead of 78.<br /><br />however, seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie, the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century. even then, you might puke.<br /><br />4/10 (but i commend merhige for crafted a piece of art, even if it is unwatchable)
