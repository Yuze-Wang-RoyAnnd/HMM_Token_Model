this review has been written by someone who has read it (several times) and knows what they are talking about!. firstly i have read others comments and noticed that some of the objections were really quite stupid. people who have read the book and other jane austens or for that matter any good book, will know that sticking to the book is vital you have to trust an author with what they do. if the viewer does not like it because it sticks to the book well it shows they do not understand jane austen and obviously are not a true fan.<br /><br />firstly if the viewer truly loved the book or jane austen in general, watching it for four hours should not prove difficult. secondly, their society did care a lot for looks and so big, fancy hair styles would show off how rich you were, which in their day was a key factor for getting along in "good" society. i have to confess the female costumes were not brilliant but there were only a few bad ones and the males made up for it, also this prejudice for the naval men not in their uniform is in nice words very silly!, today people do not go out with their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century. also as it goes the acting is very good, it is subtle because that is how jayne austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. you can not compare the filming to that of the 1995 version as technology has improved so much since them it is ridiculous to compare them in that. the actress who plays ann is too old but her air of acting and how she does it makes up for it.<br /><br />people seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that i can not comprehend!. it does not stick to the book at all and so is flat, the ending is sentimental, they change major scenes, the only good actors are the leads and they i give you did a good job for what was given to them. obviously the people who really, really like it are (i am sorry) stupid as they do not understand persuasion and so need it to be overdone. the 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, was written by an excellent script writer (same who did inspector morse), had very good actors and really it is a film you can watch many times and during each you can be delighted with it.
