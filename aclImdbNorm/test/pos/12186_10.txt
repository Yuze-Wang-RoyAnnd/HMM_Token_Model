i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it, but it has grown on me. i love the costumes and poses the actors make, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. the scenes are very rich, and it moves very quickly. every time i watch it, there is something new that catches my eye. aaliyah as akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough.<br /><br />also, the lestat in this movie is different, it is not the same character. you can see that the character armand has been given lestat-like qualities because i'm assuming anne wanted it in. but there is no reason to trash this movie just because it's not like books, it's a fascinating by itself.
