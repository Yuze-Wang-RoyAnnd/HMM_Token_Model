easily one of my favourite dramatic tv films, in many ways beautiful yet sad, heart-warming and thought-provoking, this is a superb dramatisation of a few years in the life of c.s. lewis and his relationship with joy davidman. i found it to be incredibly absorbing with excellent and 'realistic' dialogue and situations. it all seemed very 'real', yet there were also 'magical' moments that almost leave you breathless with delight. ackland and bloom as the central characters were excellent, as were the supporting cast. it's one of those dramas that i find hard to criticise, simply because, for me, there is nothing to be criticised, it just works so well on so many levels.<br /><br />very highly recommended.
