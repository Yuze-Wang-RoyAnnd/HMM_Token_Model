if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. it's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles. as evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. to get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. i know, i know, that's hard to do when you consider custer's last stand at the little big horn and it's prominence in the history of post civil war america. so i guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />there's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. custer's arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. the practical joke by sharp (arthur kennedy) putting him up in the major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in custer's first meeting with libby bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie (hattie mcdaniel). i hadn't noticed it before in other films, but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties, mantan moreland. so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress. with that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />as for flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed j.e.b. stuart opposite ronald reagan's depiction of general custer in "santa fe trail", both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland. in that film, reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers, while in flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. but it doesn't come close to that of richard mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's "little big man". let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer's character, when he stated - "you take glory with you when it's your time to go".
