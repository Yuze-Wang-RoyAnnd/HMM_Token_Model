this film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of rom communities woven together by music. it's very much a musician's film, because of the paucity of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is, is not important to the structure of the narrative. some might expect a national geographic tale of "customs, dress, and music" or a plot-line orbiting a few central characters - don't look for that here.<br /><br />this is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples, rather than telling a story of individuals. the plot is the story through space (india to andalucia) and/or/ time (we cannot tell) of a people. there is no need of narration. you get a sense of a joyous people, strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important. and a great sense of sadness in parts, at their rejection by society at large.<br /><br />so it's a paean to rom culture, very beautifully shot, with a wide spectrum of rom music, and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced, and still face.
