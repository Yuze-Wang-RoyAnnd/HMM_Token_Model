this is clive barker's masterpiece in my opinion. the movie has a great storyline and some amazing make-up and effects. the one thing i would love to see happen is a sequel. the movie was set up for a sequel and with improved technology the second movie could be incredible. david cronenberg must appear in a sequel as well as craig sheffer. but this particular movie was a great original, creative and entertaining idea and i could watch it over and over again. cronenberg was perfect in this movie and sheffer added an interesting spice to the film.
