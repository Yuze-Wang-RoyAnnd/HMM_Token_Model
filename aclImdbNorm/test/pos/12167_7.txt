this trio of 30-minute short films on gay-related themes are all quite respectably executed. each coming-of-age story is played out with pleasant charm and naturalness. this film deserves to be widely distributed and easily obtainable. however, it isn't. i had to order my video copy; none of the local video stores or even the libraries had it in stock.
