"checking out" is a very witty and honest portrayal of a bizarre family that happens to be jewish. judaism plays virtually no role in the film, but american jewish culture & behavior gets thoroughly sent up... it a loving way. i wish the movie dealt with the religious perspective on the topics it explores, because i think that would have been interesting. <br /><br />i've never been a columbo fan so i wasn't familiar with peter falk - he's a lot of fun to watch. it's great to see judge reinhold, laura san giacomo & david paymer again - why don't they work more? they're all hilarious. the script is terrific with a lot of memorable one-liners i'll be sure to use with my own family. watch for gavin mcleod (captain stubing!) as the doorman.
