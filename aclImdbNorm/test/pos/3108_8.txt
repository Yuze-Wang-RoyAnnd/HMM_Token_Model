both jackie and candice are terrific in this movie. they are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. in particular, the way candice pronounces the words "puerto rican" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. i had seen the original of this movie, called "old acquaintance", starring bette davis and miriam hopkins. they allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. hart bochner and meg ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent, in particular bochner, who never got many decent parts in movies, as far as i am concerned. george cukor did not make another movie after this, so this was a good one to go out on.
