living in romania, i was almost stunned by the very realistic setting for the scenes and the great care paid to local details by the director. the performance of anthony queen is absolutely great, and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting him. the movie does take a little knowledge of the east european context in order to be fully enjoyed, but it remains otherwise a great performance with some memorable lines. the ending is maybe a bit too melodramatic, but that's actually the way people are in this part of the world i believe the screenplay is great, because it presents the horrors of the 2nd ww in a most original manner - no blood, no battlefields. still, lives are shattered, and the smiles you get every now and then throughout the movie are quickly killed by the war realities touching the characters.
