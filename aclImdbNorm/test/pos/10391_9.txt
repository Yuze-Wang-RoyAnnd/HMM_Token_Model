i saw this film for the first time last night. i have been thinking about it all night and this morning. i cannot say that it was my favorite film, at least not yet. i need to see it again. <br /><br />the cinematography is stunning. each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has wim wenders's name attached to it.<br /><br />it is always tempting to see de chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom, but in this case the analogy fits. in many ways the figure of malkovich walking through the fog and wind of ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts milan in the major works of the italo-greek painter. he is slightly menacing, a presence who watches and, in his capacity as a film director, exerts influence on the entire story. <br /><br />the dedicated wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of damiel and cassiel wandering through the streets of berlin, watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. and, following the himmel uber berlin metaphor, the angel (or in this case malkovich the director) gets to interact with one of the stories. <br /><br />at this point i have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far. i need to see the movie again. i am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring malkovich's monologue together. <br /><br />perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious, empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. maybe that is the whole point of it. no one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.<br /><br />we must be careful when throwing around the word "pretentious." it is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension, but that leads to a terrifying mental state, one in which the only conversation seen as genuine, earthy or authentic is the most banal. when we shun all discussions of philosophy, god, existence, meaning and all that brain candy, we are setting our culture up to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. perhaps this is the warning that wenders and antonioni are giving us. it certainly is not the only theme of the film, but i think that it cannot be ignored.<br /><br />the other (and most obvious) leitmotif is that of satisfaction. there is a lot here on that, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.<br /><br />my advice is to see the film. but i offer a caveat: it is not an autonomous film (at least i don't think so yet). some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the zeitgeist before approaching the film. par-dela les nuages is one of those films.
