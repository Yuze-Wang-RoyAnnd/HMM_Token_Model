i watched this movie as a child and still enjoy viewing it every once in a while for the nostalgia factor. when i was younger i loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters. today, i still love the characters. additionally, i think of the plot with higher regard because i now see the morals and symbolism. rainbow brite is far from the worst film ever, and though out-dated, i'm sure i will show it to my children in the future, when i have children.
