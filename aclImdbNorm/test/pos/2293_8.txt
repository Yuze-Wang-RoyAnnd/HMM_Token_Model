you have to have lived in japan for awhile to enjoy the beauty of this movie! i lived on okinawa for over 2 years, and northern honshu for 4. believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of contrasting east/west mentalities, both from a sports as well as personal relationships perspective. a funny, funny, and heartwarming movie that deserves better than americans viewing it can ever judge. 8+ out of 10!
