this movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of the chronicles of narnia. shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written. it is well executed, acted and directed. the cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but i'm sure it was intended to be so. the screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie, through out the movie i found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen. this is a wonderful piece of cinema and i can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. fair warning though this was a 6 tissue movie for me. very touching. very heartfelt performances.
