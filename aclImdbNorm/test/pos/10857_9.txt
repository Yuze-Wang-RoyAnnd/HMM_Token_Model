for every fan of coming of age tales, this 3 hour adaptation of the<br /><br />sarah waters novel is pure fun. cinematic nods to baz luhrman's<br /><br />kinetic style, as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces<br /><br />ever present on the bbc (where you're likely to have seen almost<br /><br />every prominent member of this cast). it's rather bawdy and over<br /><br />the top in spots, but that's just what the novel called for. the cast<br /><br />is appealing and, in the cases of anna chancellor and hugh<br /><br />bonneville, perfect. in the case of rachel sterling, as our heroine<br /><br />nan, you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty to<br /><br />ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. it's a fantasy, after all. <br /><br />some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in<br /><br />character (particularly that of jodhi may's character, florence), but<br /><br />the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and<br /><br />provide an overall high quality entertainment value.
