my partner and i sat down to watch this film over a bottle of wine last saturday and although we initially had our reservations once the story got going it was in actual fact rather gripping. the scene in which one of the characters in brutally murdered by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of korean new wave auteur park chan wook. the weapon of choice was a particular masterstroke and allowed us to see into the psyche of 'granny', heavily altering the connotations of a loving, warm grandmother into a murderous hag. the dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the innermost paranoia the protagonist. pavlosky's selections of mise en scene furthermore enhance the unnerving and manical atmosphere of the nights events, combining with the oscar worthy performances to create a chilling and thought provoking masterpiece. the ending, which i won't spoil for you here, reminded my partner and myself of m night shyamalan's institutional masterwork the sixth sense for it's mind altering twist that has left me thinking weeks after viewing. definitely one to watch, repeatedly!
