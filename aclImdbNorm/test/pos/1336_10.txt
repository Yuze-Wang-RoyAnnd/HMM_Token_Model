i just called my brother paulie on the phone and he said he was watching hoods and it was funny. so, like i said, never go against the family! the demand for more lines is ok since i like to express my own opinions quite frequently. if something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain. this gives me yet another chance to take my shots at "the departed". when one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful. all you need is a good directer,the same guy i believe who did my favorite mob movie, "goodfellows), but in a completely different way.and then just throw in jack the great and you got yourself an oscar. easy as pie. i have to see hoods to make sure it wasn't better than "the departed" gibbs
