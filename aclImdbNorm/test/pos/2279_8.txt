this film got less attention than "league of their own," possibly because it has only one "name" star. but whereas women's professional baseball had only an eight year, midwestern town existence, japanese baseball is a vastly bigger entity, both in financial underwriting and popular support. that alone would make it the better movie.<br /><br />"mr. baseball" shows the facts of life of japan-ball: the regimented cheering, the deference to umpires, the pressure of corporate owners on managers, the extreme conservatism of play - and no hot dog players welcome.<br /><br />it also touches upon the isolation that any gai-jin - but especially an american jock, not the people most versed in foreign cultures - feels living in dai nippon. and the japanese, for their part, are not comfortable around foreigners and let it show in various ways ("the gai-jin strike zone," one american player complains, "bigger than a buick.")<br /><br />the script may not have won any awards, playing once again on the "redemption by improved play" theme, but i found it considerably more enjoyable to watch than the pokey "league." definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle on this great sport.
