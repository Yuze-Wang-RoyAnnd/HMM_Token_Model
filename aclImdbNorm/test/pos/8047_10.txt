some of the reviewers here have foolishly judged this silent film by political-correctness standards of today. <br /><br />"battle" was an excellent film for several reasons, correctly noted by more rational reviewers: superb cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. <br /><br />its stars were in effect the d.w. griffith stock company and to this silent movie fan, that is inducement enough to watch it and to enjoy it. <br /><br />i saw it many years ago and just watched it again at youtube; that was a very poor quality print, but coupled with my memory of a good print in a real theater, i can justifiably recommend this to reasonable people and film historians.
