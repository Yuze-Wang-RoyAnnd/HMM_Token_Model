i don't think i will include any spoilers but if i do, i can cover my butt. "the last american virgin" came in a time were such teenage coming of age/high school sex romps were the rave. films such as "prepies" (1984), "hot times" (1974) and the popular "porky's " (1981) were making mucho money. yet it is the "last american virgin" the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations. it is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity. the go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous ones (older woman with jealous boyfriend) and the convenient ones (luring their high school female counterparts). the movie has a lot of funny moments, and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star, it is worth remembering for a fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes: devo, the cars, journey and others. by today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a nc-17 rating, but is a well told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain,while love might be right in front of us. it is a little piece of 80s americana and worth having in your movie collection.
