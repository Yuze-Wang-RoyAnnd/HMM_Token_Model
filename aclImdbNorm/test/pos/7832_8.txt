ok firstly, if your not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then don't bother with this. you really need to be a fan to get the gag.<br /><br />the move is basically about snakes ..on a train. lots of them.<br /><br />there is an ancient curse involved and a crazy ending which i wont spoil. the gore effect are full on and real icky... but the movie is mainly one big gory gag about snakes scaring the hell out of a bunch of people trapped on a train.<br /><br />the suspense is built up well and there are some memorable and well composed scenes.. some of the acting is a bit hammy (watch for the surf dudes) but thats not really the point... give this movie a go. know what to expect and you wont regret it!
