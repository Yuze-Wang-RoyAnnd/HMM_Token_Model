..especially by lambert. this is the essential burrough's tarzan that i grew up reading when i was a kid. i have read a few negative reviews on this film and couldn't help but wonder what their issue was. they obviously didn't see the movie i did or they were expecting something that was more akin to the saturday afternoon serials.<br /><br />this was the tarzan that was of the novel and the film makers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously. lambert was excellent. i still think he is one of hollywood's most under-rated actors. this was a movie that he shines in.<br /><br />the photography and the apes, done by rick baker both were amazing. you definitely felt the since of the jungle. the 2nd half, tarzan's attempt at being civilized really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had was forced to resolve.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film
