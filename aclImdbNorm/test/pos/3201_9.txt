i guess i wasn't sure to what to expect from this film, it had a good cast, an interesting story line, and a bunch of other things going for it, but i still couldn't shake a feeling of dread that i had in my stomach about what it would be like. i am glad to say that i was very pleased with the result and regret worrying about it all along. the films opening scenes were extremely intriguing and were enough to sustain early interest in the film. as the film progressed we were introduced to the characters of the film, as well as what happened in the prison riots. like most reviews for this film, i have to admit that there is some unessecary cliches but it can't erase the overall power of this film that reads like a good novel. the cast are all great, particularly chestnut and mcgowan, and the film ranks as one of the better made-for-tv films of this year. certainly worth watching if you are looking for a good courtroom drama.
