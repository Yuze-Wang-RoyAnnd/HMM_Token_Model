the movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!<br /><br />this film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. it knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the "child's play" series. <br /><br />it plays up the "stoopid humor" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing at it, but with it. and, trust me, the whole time you're laughing, it's laughing back atcha.<br /><br />
