the reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. well acted, directed, shot and written. i was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. the performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. the actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. less is much better in this case. this film is a prime example of how these low budget contracts benefit actors as well as film makers.
