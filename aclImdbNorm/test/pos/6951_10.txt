i was really surprised when i came across this movie on cable tv a couple of years ago. the story is a wonderful example of how our land keeps changing and the fight to hang on to it and use it according to need. conflicting desires of "the people" and the government. the actors were fantastic in their portrayals and i absolutely fell in love with tantoo cardinal-she is so believable and was such a character in this movie, as was rip torn. the story was also a love story about the land, the past, and between the 2 main characters. i have tried to buy this film and have been unable to locate it-but i would sure would love to own it.
