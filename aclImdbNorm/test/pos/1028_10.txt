>>> great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for 31st july 2006,uk - there is also a scheduled release in states - don't know the date - can't wait ! ! <<<<<br /><br />>>>> below is my original comment <<<<<<br /><br />i agree with all the other reviewers - it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvd<br /><br />the story line is gripping - the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling !<br /><br />over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns <br /><br />it's very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production ? i'm going to e:mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens. who did the production ? was it bbc ? rw
