a wealthy young man, raised as a son of the gods, must confront his chinese heritage while living in a white world.<br /><br />although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous, the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting.<br /><br />richard barthelmess has the title role as the sweet-natured oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks caucasian. barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout, gazing intently into the middle distance (a mannerism he developed during silent days) whenever his character is indecently misused. he makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in d. w. griffith's broken blossoms (1919) and this is to his credit. beautiful constance bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes barthelmess miserable. she is gorgeous as always, but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen.<br /><br />multi-talented frank albertson has a small role as barthelmess' improvident buddy. serene e. alyn warren and blustery anders randolf play the leading stars' very different fathers, while claude king distinguishes his brief appearance as the english author who befriends barthelmess.<br /><br />movie mavens will recognize little dickie moore, uncredited, playing barthelmess as a tiny child.<br /><br />the original technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint. the shot purporting to be the south of france instead looks suspiciously like avalon on santa catalina island, off the coast of southern california.
