i'm a fan of b grade 80s films in which the hero is a bit of a bad guy, a strong male, who finds love - and this film delivers!<br /><br />towards the finish you do not know how sharky will not be killed (and doesn't he take a beating! realistically portrayed i believe). however he does and it's not via some overdone 'die hard' stunt. the 'past it' team he works with comes together, hence the title. his team are all characters - people on the sideline at work because they don't quite conform. these portrayals are funny and sympathetic - they have a real feeling to them. they're up against an iceman of an assassin, with a good team of his own. the result is a great film noir.
