i have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time. it is very suspenseful and intense. to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing. it is the kind of movie where you need can't miss a thing, but if you soak it in it sticks with you long after it ends. now thinking about it i don't even know what stone was trying to make us see. just the story of alan green? i don't think so. it was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption, and a guy just loosing his grip. maybe he had more grip than the listeners though. i didn't like barry but still seemed worried about him for some reason. i was perplexed at why i couldn't get him out of my mind when the movie ended. i wish i could see inside olive stone's mind for this one.
