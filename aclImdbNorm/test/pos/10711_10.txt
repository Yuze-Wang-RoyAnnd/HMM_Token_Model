i just love this movie and i have my tv programed to record it when it comes on again on nov. 2nd. it is a really nice love story with a twist. the song that is played at the end of the movie is one you would not think would be a big hit but it is a song that stays in your head and i am now trying to find that song so i can hear it and play it. i really have no style of the shows i see or the songs i like to hear and there for makes me pretty open to seeing things new with an open mind. i would like to say there is some parts in this movie that is not meant for the whole family to watch. this movie does show skin. it is kinda like a lifetime movie for women, about women. i say watch the movie and you may just like it as much as i did.
