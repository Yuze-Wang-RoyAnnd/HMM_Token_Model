just watched this movie and it's not bad; there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings. comes off as fairly intelligent; fastpaced almost like 'documentary style'. this movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars,street scenes,and life in the 50's. the acting is fairly solid and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a good pace. an atomic era film buff shouldn't miss this one.
