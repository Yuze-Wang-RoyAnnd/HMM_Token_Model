this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end. not that that is bad, it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character. consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile. if you liked dostoyevsky's 'crime and punishment," you will probably like this if only for the comparisons. the intriguing question that the movie prompts is, "what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly-aproved ideas for another set?" the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo-if you are a conservative you will not like this movie. <br /><br />besides other philosophical questions, i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well. the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start. also, there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters. if these sorts of things do not impress you, skip it. overall i give this movie a 7.
