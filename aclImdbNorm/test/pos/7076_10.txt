after renting one true thing the other night, i have learned to respect my family, and not take their health for granted. i have never seen such a real-life portrayal of a cancer victim on screen like meryl delivered. she deserves the oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the running. all i can say is beautiful film, great acting from streep and zellwegger. meryl streep revealed her one true ability in this excellent film!
