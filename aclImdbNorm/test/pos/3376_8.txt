the premise is rather original and well thought-of, but unfortunately, siding a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects. jeff fahey does his best amongst a poor cast, as does the always beautiful linda hoffman. they should make more movies together. the movie, while not worth much praise, warrants at least one viewing.
