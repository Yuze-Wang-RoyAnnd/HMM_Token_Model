every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be.<br /><br />the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time. but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be.<br /><br />a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood.<br /><br />if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. and don't forget to switch the light off.<br /><br />my points on different aspects:-<br /><br />direction = 9/10 acting = 8/10 atmosphere = 10/10 sound effect = 9/10<br /><br />total = 9/10
