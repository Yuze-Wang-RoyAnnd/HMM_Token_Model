i'm very surprised that so many people don't like this movie. i think it's a lot better than most of the teen films that have come out recently - ten things i hate about you ( can we say teeny bopper film and what was with the principle writing those porno novels ? ), cruel intentions ( where a character gives up their virginity because of a fun car ride ), and she's all that ( mediocre ). if your looking for something that's just fun - i say go with never been kissed. my mom loved it and she hates movies ( one of her favorites is beaches ). this is a great fantasy about what you would do different if you could go back to high school. people who were outcasts in high school will probably like this movie better. it reminds me of 'romy and michele's high school reunion'. and the ending puts me in the best mood. sure the plot has been done, but how many recent movies can you honestly say haven't been done in one form or another. the cast is also charming. and for those who think drew can't be geeky - she pulls it off just great. another good teen comedy that i recommend which was made recently is election but it's more of a satire on school and politics.
