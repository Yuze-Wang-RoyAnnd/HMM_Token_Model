the seven-ups is a good and engrossing film. it's packed with credible performances by scheider, labianco and an effective scary performance by richard lynch - although most of the characters are card-board cut-out tough guys. character development does not evolve at all on the screen. the only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad. deviating from the crime story norm, the seven-ups manage to throw scheider and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist. onsite locations of new york city and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film. the only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning. they give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related (until later in the film). had someone blindly started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story. otherwise, the seven-ups is a gritty, testosterone-filled enjoyable time.
