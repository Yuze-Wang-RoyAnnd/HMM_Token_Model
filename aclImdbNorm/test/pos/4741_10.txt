after watching "waco: the rules of engagement" i was just sitting in disbelief of what i was witness to. a big cover up by the fbi, a massacre by gung-ho/trigger happy government agents? i clearly remember the waco standoff, i was 17 years old at the time and watched it all on cnn. i remembered reflecting about all the children as i watched the mount camel compound burn in april 1993. i remember feeling sorry for the children, but clearly felt that it was the fault of their evil leader david koresh and the other davidians. gazecki's film shows clearly and beyond doubt, even though it is biased, that the fbi lied over and over again. i think that this film was a big contributor to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in 1999. the outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable, the judgement relied on fact that was just as grey as the facts that the davidians presented. i was very disappointed about the verdict, because as far as i know it didn't take into account all the lying, misinformation and evidence cover-up by the fbi and other officials. why have no one be prosecuted for hampering the work of the texas rangers investigators? why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and bulldoze the compound shortly after the incident? these are questions that i haven't been given answers to by the government. most importantly, what about the children? in this new investigation i haven't been informed about who was responsible for spraying the cs flammable tear-gas into a compound with many hazards for igniting this gas and i haven't found any answer to whether the children's muscles contracted due to the effects of the gas, while they were alive. if they did, i would surely think that the janet reno or who ever was in charge of the raid should be indicted for mass-homicide or manslaughter. the question that was raised by gazecki, but not mentioned is; was is a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building down with intent? (a plan that would have been accomplished with 112% efficacy) or were the officials in charge so incompetent, that their were unaware of the consequence of their actions? both are equally frightening. even if the davidians set fire to the compound, the officials in charge surely provided them with the opportunity to do the job. if the officials in charge knew, as they claimed, that the davidians would set fire to the compound, why the f
