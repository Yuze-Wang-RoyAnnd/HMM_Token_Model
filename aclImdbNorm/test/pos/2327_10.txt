the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years. the characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable. the comedic timing written into the script is more than enough to make up for a well-worn underdog plot. when you're sure you know the ending....surprise! highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular! great movie!
