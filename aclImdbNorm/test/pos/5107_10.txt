when it opened in london during the christmas season of 1969 this musical version of james hilton's famous story was drubbed by the critics. the same reception greeted it when it opened in the us, prompting mgm to withdraw its "roadshow" status and cut almost all of its songs. what a mistake!!!<br /><br />watched years later, when the trendy world of the 60's and 70's has turned in upon itself, this version of goodbye, mr.chips is a total delight. first of all, as "chipping", peter o'toole gives one of his greatest performances. to watch him turn from the hated, cold, emotionless latin teacher at a boy's boarding school, to a man who finally can see the colors in the world (after falling for and marrying musical star catherine briskit) is to see a genius at work. (if you can, watch lawrence of arabia, the lion in winter, my favorite year and chips back to back over a number of days or weeks. then you will see what a truly great actor o'toole is, and how magnificent he is in chips.) <br /><br />catherine, as played by the glowing petula clark, at the height of her popularity, is ever man's dream; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a great voice to boot. most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly, while the direction by the late herbert ross brings the proceedings wonderfully to life.<br /><br />okay, this film may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted, sung, and directed love story, look no further. (if you can get your hands of the laser disc wide screen version, better yet. i am anxiously awaiting chips' debut on dvd.)
