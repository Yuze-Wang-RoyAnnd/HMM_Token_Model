i had never heard of this film and only got it because i am a martin sheen fan. now i am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves. the four characters all make you feel for them, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in vietnam. one felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of 'ordinary' families after vietnam. emilio estevez as jeremy was superb - totally unhinged by his war experience which none of his family could relate to. the screen chemistry between him and his real-life father martin sheen was amazing. and there were times when emilio's anguished face was so like martin's in "apocalypse now". i feel sure that just as martin has counted apocalype as one of his best films, emilio will count this one as one of his best too. the scene with the gun was totally mind-blowing, as all the emotions were there on the family's faces. brilliant acting by estevez, sheen and kathy bates. i watched the film for the first time last night - and today the lead story in the news was about a gulf war veteran who had shot several members of his family. how many more young men are going to have their lives destroyed by war?
