to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it.<br /><br />this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. their inventive and comedic series (sort of an american idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.<br /><br />this is their take on their "manufactured image" and status as the 2nd tier beatles. they always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.<br /><br />it is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (i have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.<br /><br />see it with an open mind.
