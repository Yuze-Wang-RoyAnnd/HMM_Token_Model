so it isn't an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar<br /><br />(sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. an<br /><br />imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well<br /><br />spent. for some reason, it hasn't really caught on in the audience,<br /><br />something i do believe is a result of the main theme. why did she<br /><br />commit suicide? clearly, this is hardly something that us<br /><br />moviegoers will flock to, had it been an european production it<br /><br />probably would have reached its audience in a much greater<br /><br />extent. it is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by a<br /><br />shimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole hearted<br /><br />impression.
