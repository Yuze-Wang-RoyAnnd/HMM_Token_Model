this movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. the daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. the on-location scenery is absorbingly authentic, and the soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving. this film is a graduate-level course in a reality that's too little recognized in american society. personally, i'm freaked out by the names of the characters -- lange's character is ginny cook smith -- my name is connie cook smith, and my mom is genny cook. the youngest daughter is caroline cook, which is my sister's name, and the father is larry cook, my cousin's name.but sex abuse was not in our immediate family.
