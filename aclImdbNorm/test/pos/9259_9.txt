my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film. does it work? yes. gee runs for mayor and gets shot. the homicide "hall of fame" turns up. pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series. a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn't seen the tv-series but it amuses the fans too. the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up. and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox. this is a good film.
