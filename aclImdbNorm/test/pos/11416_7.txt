im a big horror fan and i quite enjoyed this remake. with all these horror remakes floating about i think this is one of the better attempts.<br /><br />i watched it with my two little sisters and i think it made it even better as they were quite scared. also with the shouting at the screen "dont do that!", "not that way!", etc. i thought there were some good little jumpy moments and it built the tension well.<br /><br />camilla belle is absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress - so she holds your attention well. <br /><br />overall a decent film.
