the make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other. matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. he's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. he overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail amy. he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice. when they do talk he can't show her who he really is. she empathizes and then stonewalls him at just the right moments. she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit. (for me.) i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty, . . . girl next door pretty, i call it. so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up.<br /><br />funny things happen with the coach, but matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. the football scenes at the end were perplexing. matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back. folks, he isn't the right size! he's fifty pounds too light for that position. but i thought his acting was skilled. i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe. the film was all right. meredith m was better than all right.
