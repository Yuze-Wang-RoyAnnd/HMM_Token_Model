not too many people seem to know about this movie. which is too bad because i think it's pretty good. sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. i think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch i suppose) and ken takakura (from black rain) plays the chief (the coach of the japanese baseball team). there isn't too much to complain about. it's just a light, easy-going, happy comedy and i recommend it.
