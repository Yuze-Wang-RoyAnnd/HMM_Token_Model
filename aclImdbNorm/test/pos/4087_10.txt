like some people here, i love/loved stingers! in norway it got aired a lot later. that also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) i have to say that i really love stingers! it can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. i think i'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. stingers might be the on series(except from grey's anatomy) that i really watch! the actors are amazing! especially jacinta stapleton! personallly i think she is one of the best access we have! i know he is not like super-known, but she is really a great actress! stingers makes me want to be a cop! i love it!<br /><br />p.s: do you know if you can buy the episodes?
