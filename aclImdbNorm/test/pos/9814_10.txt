in reply to "state of confusion" the dogs injuries do seem to disappear rather abruptly, but that may have only been an error in continuity. but, as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk, it's just a simple matter of imagination. these are two very young kids who have extremely active imaginations and they must rely on those imaginations to keep themselves from being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that goes on in their home from their stepfather. as for the stepfather, it's very interesting that the director chose to no show his face. that makes him seem more monstrous. if you show his face, then that character becomes a person and not just this "monster" who is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. by showing only the concequences of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself, the children then become the main focus of the movie. this film has no loose ends, but runs just as a father's tale to his children would. it has embelleshments. this is a fine american classic.
