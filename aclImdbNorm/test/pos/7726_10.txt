even for the non-opera loving public the name carmen is immediately recognized as an opera by bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. but as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by prosper m'erim'ee in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted spanish director vicente aranda ('juana la loca aka mad love','amantes', 'if they tell you i fell', etc.). incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of carmen from one of her lovers - jos'e - provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told. <br /><br />carmen (the amazingly beautiful and talented paz vega) works in a cigar factory in seville, a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper jos'e (leonardo sbaraglia) is stationed. carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that carmen is a gypsy, carmen murders the co-worker and is arrested. jos'e is physically attracted to the voluptuous carmen and when carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with carmen. carmen keeps her pact, providing jos'e with his first sexual encounter, and jos'e is doomed. his lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release jos'e encounters carmen again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are carmen's people. many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over, behavior's that include carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of carmen and jos'e comes to a tragic end. <br /><br />one factor that makes the story (as adapted for the screen by director aranda and joaquim jord`a move so well is the role that prosper m'erim'ee (jay benedict) plays: his questioning of jos'e completes the story that bizet's opera only outlines. the acting is superb, the cinematography by paco femenia and the excellent musical score by jos'e nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. this is a must for lovers of the opera carmen, and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. highly recommended. grady harp
