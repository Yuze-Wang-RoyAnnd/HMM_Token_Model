the hilarious team that brought you 'cnnnn' and 'the chaser decides' have returned to the abc with their new series, 'the chaser's war on everything.' filmed in front of a live audience, the chaser team, once again, does what it does best- lampooning key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities.<br /><br />the satire is simply priceless, and nothing is sacred. in recent weeks, the chaser team has chased alongside the queen (during her visit to australia) to try and have john howard dismissed and had kim beazley (aust. opposition leader) threaten to kneecap them.<br /><br />a particularly funny segment is "mr. ten questions," showing an overly enthusiastic reporter who approaches celebrities (recently charlize theron and the backstreet boys) and asks them ten such inane questions as "what is your optimum length of rice grain?" just for the record, theron ignored him and walked away, and one of the backstreet boys got angry and "refused to dignify it with a response."<br /><br />a segment that recently had me in stitches was when one of the team decided to become a 'statue busker' to score some extra money. when he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in his place. the perfect scam! he got thirty dollars in twenty minutes!<br /><br />a brilliant satire of everything in australian society. two thumbs up!<br /><br />(by the way, the show won't be showing for the three weeks after easter, because "though the team are all atheists, they're also hypocrites.")
