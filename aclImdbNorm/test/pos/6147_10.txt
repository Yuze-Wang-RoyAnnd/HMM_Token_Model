as i watched "wirey spindell" i couldnt but laugh at what was taking place on screen. wirey sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played wirey in h.s. was 10 years old. then the actor changed age to like 20 to play wirey when he was a senior in hs...but whatever, i thought it was funny.
