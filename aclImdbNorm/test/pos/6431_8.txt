it must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens, yet still grip the viewers attention. i think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing, wise and fatherly, (i'm not gay) it reminds of the qualities that robert redford has in narrating. the end is very sad, but beautiful. one wonders how long harry has left, will he be lonely and will he get to say his goodbyes? also one gets annoyed at mr hauer for not getting involved in more work of this caliber. lets hope he continues to do fine work in holland and stays away from hollywood.<br /><br />worth watching
