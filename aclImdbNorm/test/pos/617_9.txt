this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. one knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.<br /><br />well, forget it. the movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow. all right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder. but this movie doesn't let you go.<br /><br />it's like the old gangster movies, but then without any glamour at all and in russia. and that's one of the most important aspects of this movie: it's situated in russia. this does have a great impact on the movie, according to me it makes it better. everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. this could be a great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the russian mafia.<br /><br />it is a beautifull and terrifying movie. it's horror, but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. one last advice: don't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.
