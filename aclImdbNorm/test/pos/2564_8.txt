black snake moan is uproarious. it is over-flowingly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. in continuation of hustle & flow, brewer paints his portrait of the american south almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a fantasy or ancient greece epic. and yet as far high above us his movies hover, they are still rooted; rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is.<br /><br />as in traditional fairy-tales, brewer paints his portrait in black snake moan using extremes and exaggerations. sharp and stark character traits, when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film. but brewer doesn't begin his film with "once upon a time"; in this film and also in hustle & flow, brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; a dark, gothic fable of sex, prostitution, and ultimately, redemption. these themes run through the film's veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, brooding setting.<br /><br />but despite these harsh extremes, brewer treats his characters like humans, and creates extremely well-executed, three-dimensional characterizations in lazarus and rae, particularly emphasized with their relationships with lazerus' friend at the pharmacy, angela, and rae's mother.<br /><br />the acting is, all-around, quite perfect. one gets the feeling that both christina ricci and samuel l. jackson were born to play these roles. their characterizations are so intense and so severe; it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters. and they succeed admirably. samuel l. jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character's he's played before. with films like pulp fiction, jackie brown, shaft, and others, he has crafted for himself a typecast of the "ultimate bad-ass". in black snake moan jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything he's done before. and frankly, it's just fantastic. what comes as quite a surprise, though, is the casting of justin timberlake, and more specifically, the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable. sure he doesn't have much screen time, but like what brewer did with ludicrous in hustle & flow, he actually gets timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do, and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating.<br /><br />but what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere brewer creates. the rural southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark, dirty, grimy, crusty, rugged kind of texture to the entire film, which more than fits in with the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects. and by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of cicadas when rae gets her itch, or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as lazarus plays his "black snake moan" blues number for rae, brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world, an undermined mythology to the rural southern setting. and it works so utterly fantastically to craft brewer's unique vision.<br /><br />and one can't talk about a craig brewer film without mentioning the music. in hustle & flow, he utilized a soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision. in this film, the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere. it is a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. and it sounds just absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />in all, it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old, broken, lonely, god-fearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania, there may have not been very much to write home about. but this film is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as they are crafted in the film regardless. no, this film is about the vision
