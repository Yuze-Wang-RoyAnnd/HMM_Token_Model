okay i marked this spoiler so don't be upset when i wrap this up. now i went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. and i was right, as almost every horror flick i have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. what helped was the story, i did not expect there to be a "why" to kane's madness. but there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for. but if your a fan of saw, or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch. now where i really throw in a spoiler for a second warning. i give this movie a 9 perhaps because i'm a fan of the wwe and a fan of kane, but who doesn't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love. however this movie could have scored a 10 for me if. . . (spoiler)----> at the end of the movie when it showed kane dead on the pavement. while a dog pissing in his eye was "cute" it could have been classic with the kane/undertaker quick sit up and turn of the head. a perfect 10 would have been awarded if that would have happened. it was a perfect opportunity, but either the wwe didn't think of that or a future sequel will begin with that very sequence i mentioned. that's all.
