when the noble hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping samanosuke clan, loyal retainer kogenta (jun fujimaki) escapes with his lord's eight year old son, tadafumi, and his daughter, kozasa. they are sheltered by the priestess shinobu (otome tsukimiya), who serves the hanabusa clan's god, majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the side of a local mountain. ten years later, kogenta and tadafumi (yoshihiko aoyama) seek vengeance against lord samanosuke (yutaro gomi), but are captured in the attempt, and sentenced to die. priestess shinobu, desperately attempting to save her master, threatens samanosuke with the god's displeasure, only to be slashed to death for her efforts. samanosuke, a vain, cruel, narrow man, orders majin's statue to be destroyed, in order to crush any last vestiges of hope among the remaining hanabusa loyalists. but the god majin, who hitherto has been implacably silent, has other ideas...<br /><br />daimajin is an enthralling, timeless, deeply moving fairy tale. lavishly produced on a respectable budget, it is a film about values: the values of nobility, of justice, of decency, of loyalty, of self sacrifice, and of love. it is about hierarchy, and rule, and of the consequences of failing to live up to the responsibility that rule entails. these are things that are not talked about much in our demotic times, except by scribbling toads like william bennet, but are nonetheless relevant, and daimajin shows us why. <br /><br />daimajin is a perfect example of why japanese cinema is so glorious. the values listed above have palpable relevance for those involved in this film, as they do for many a japanese filmmaker. there is no lip service, no condescension, no irony here. instead, there is an authentic effort to conjure a world where these values can once again have life, and to show what happens when they fall into abeyance. just compare daimajin, or the lone wolf and cub series, or any kurosawa film to the egregious tarantino's nihilistic kill bill b*llshit, to see what i mean.<br /><br />in a film whose contributing talent is so uniformly excellent, i would merely like to point out master akira ifikuba's majestic score, the talent and beauty of actors jun fujimaki, yoshihiko aoyama, and miwi takada; and the stunning portrayal by otome tsukimiya. her death scene is one of the most moving and meaningful that i have ever witnessed.
