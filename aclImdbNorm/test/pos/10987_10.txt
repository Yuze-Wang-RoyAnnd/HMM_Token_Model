manna from heaven is heavenly. this is a movie for the family -- teens and grandparents can enjoy it together. but it isn't syrupy sweet or silly. the characters really are "characters". the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit. the period beginning is like watching an old photo album, or remembering back when. it's extremely well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. the story moves along quickly with twists, turns and lots of fun.<br /><br />a special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces, many of whom we haven't seen in much too long a time. part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear, though this can be distracting. cloris leachman by the end of the film looks as if she's had a make-over on "oprah". i had never seen faye grant in a movie -- only knew her as grace's mother in the tv series "saving grace". she was great, even minus the southern accent. and i didn't even recognize shelly duvall. the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented quintet and sister theresa is a heavenly treasure.
