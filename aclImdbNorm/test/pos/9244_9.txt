i found this to be an entertaining account of the challenges an independent film maker might encounter (something i never even thought about). the film managed to keep my interest the entire time and i actually laughed out loud more than once! i'm not a film maker so i know nothing about the technology but i though it was well edited and flowed smoothly telling the story. as a disclaimer, i contributed to this effort after the fact providing music for the soundtrack but i was not involved in the creation of this film and i could not tell you a thing about repo man except that i remembered seeing it way back when (i'm not really a sci-fi fiend). i enjoyed the comparisons the film made of punk rock file making to punk rock music. my wife went with me to see the film and she did not know a thing about it before hand and we had a great time.
