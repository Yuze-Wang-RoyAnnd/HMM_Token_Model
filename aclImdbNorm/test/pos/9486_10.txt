what can i say about this band, i was hooked in 68, i was a ten year old kid, i grew up on the blues though my dad, then these guys from the midlands came along, a fusion of country rock, heavy rock and blues, i wish i could have got to see them live in the early years, i was lucky enough to be there in 79(knebworth) that was the best concert i've seen to date, i hope a full version of that hot august night will be realest soon. this cd gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again, the song remains the same is great but this cd gets down to the nitty gritty.<br /><br />long live the zepp.
