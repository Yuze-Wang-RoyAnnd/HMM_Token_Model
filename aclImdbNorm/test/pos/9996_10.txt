this movie gives golf a high mark, it was well acted and well directed. giving you a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. the historic factor alone gives it a high rating, the brookline golf course was really done well. i am in the northeast and have seen brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. the movie was well done on all levels. a must see 5 stars. the acting was superb, disney has another winner in its bag of great movies. if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life. i would tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic. the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well. above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film. a must see for fans and non-fans alike.
