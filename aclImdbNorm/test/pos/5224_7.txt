if we consider three films with a similar subject, which are this one, which was made in 1930, 'the covered wagon', made in 1923 and 'wagon master' made in 1950, the distance between 'the big trail' and 'the covered wagon' is only 7 years whereas the distance between 'the big trail' and 'wagon master' is 20 years. this is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those 7 years, and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come. 'the big trail is technically close to 'wagon master', but ages apart from 'the covered wagon'. the story is about the pioneers going from the missouri to the west in oregon. tyrone power sr. is the man leading the caravan, he is a rough and mean guy. john wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks, not giving him a chance to be the wayne that we are used to. marguerite churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why wayne just does not forget her. raoul walsh was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving through the west, he directed 'the tall men' in 1955, which has a lot in common with 'the big trail'.
