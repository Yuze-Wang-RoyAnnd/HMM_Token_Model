not a bad mow. i was expecting another film based on womens issues but was pleasantly surprised at the element of suspense. sure, parts of the plot were pretty hokey but for the most part the movie kept me guessing. was the nut bar connected with the ex husband, somebody in the tavern or was it the guy (person) that she cut off? daniel magder was excellent. i've seen him in mom's on strike and in guilt by association, both mow's and he is very creditable, especially the way he challenges his mother the way a preteen would typically act.<br /><br />laura leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife) that both men and women can relate to. she was frustrated enough to seem real.<br /><br />see it if you missed it. it's worthwhile.
