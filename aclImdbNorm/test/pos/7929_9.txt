this film is one of the classics of cinema history. it was not made to please modern audiences, so some people nowadays may think it is creaky or stilted. i found it to be absorbing throughout. cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play alexander nevskyi, just as he did when he played ivan groznyi (ivan the terrible) several years later. the music was beautiful.<br /><br />my one complaint was the poor soundtrack that was quite garbled. although i only know a little russian, it would have been nice to be able to pick out more words rather than having to rely almost 100% on the subtitles. i was watching this on an old videotape from the library, though. perhaps by now a dvd version exists on which the sound has been enhanced. i would like to know whether the actors were using archaic russian or even old church slavonic when they were speaking. the subtitles were strangely worded, and it's hard for me to tell whether this was to reflect an older manner of speaking, or whether the subtitles were just somewhat poorly done.
