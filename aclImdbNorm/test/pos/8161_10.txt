without a doubt the most impressive recent gay oriented film i've seen. c. jay cox hit the nail on the head with this one. the way he handled the issues surrounding faith, family and sexuality were very well done. casting was perfect. wes ramsey did a fantastic job at pulling off the character of christian and steve sandvoss will knock your socks off in the role of aaron. both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and the impacts these issues have on young gay men. as a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment (though not mormon)the identification with aaron's character was phenomenal for me. strongly recommend this film to anyone, faithful or not, who is interested in how young gay men have to deal with family and friends in an oft times unfriendly world. by the way, the music in this film rocks! another great job by c. jay cox.
