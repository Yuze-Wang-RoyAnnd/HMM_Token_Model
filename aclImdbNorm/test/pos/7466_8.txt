i had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie "these girls" at the philadelphia film festival. going into the movie, i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting. so as i entered the theater just hours ago i wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down.<br /><br />"these girls" is the story about three best friends from a small town. keira (caroline dhavernas) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after high school but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do. lisa (holly lewis) will be going away to a christian school after the summer. and finally, glory (amanda walsh) who plans on spending her summer babysitting. but this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail keith clark (david boreanaz) the sexy older hunk who they baby-sit for. fun times and a lot of laughs ensue
