anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast (i rushed home from school to see it) now is of a certain age so i can only add my comments to those asking for a dvd release to enable those of us to relive the memories of first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unremembered tv archive history. if so many old tv series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not this? surely the rights clearances can't be that difficult. most of the shakespeare lines i can quote comes from this iconic series and i remember swapping them with my school chums as we tried to outdo each other's memories of the text. peter dews rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen. this surely was public broadcasting at its finest. robert hardy and sean connery fighting to the death - it's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the bbc television's golden age. come on bbc. clear it and license it please. march 2009 so finally the dvd is here and congratulations to those who have made it happen. the picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought. now all those who clamoured for it must buy it and relive those magic moments.<br /><br />uk viewers. given the series was made in the uk by the bbc using british actors it's strange that the dvd release is not available there on region 2 (europe) dvd and can only be imported from the us and played on modified players. it seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues, perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth wasn't it released 'region free?' so everyone could enjoy it?
