"labyrinth of passion"--with the possible exception of "matador "--is almodovar's best film. it displays his unique personality at its best and least-censored, before he started going more mainstream. almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach preston sturges' wonderful brand of lunacy. it's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about, the real point being almodovar's willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity, and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well.
