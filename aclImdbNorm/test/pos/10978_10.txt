i thoroughly enjoyed manna from heaven. the hopes and dreams and perspectives of each of the characters is endearing and we, the audience, get to know each and every one of them, warts and all. and the ending was a great, wonderful and uplifting surprise! thanks for the experience; i'll be looking forward to more.
