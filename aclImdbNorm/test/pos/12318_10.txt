john huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies i've ever seen. for his farewell he decided to adapt james joyce's beautiful short story, "the dead", and made not only one of the most faithful literature-to-film adaptations yet, he also crafted a movie that more than 20 years later still surpasses a lot of contemporary cinema.<br /><br />when i watched this movie a few years ago, as a student at university, i gazed in awe at the screen, marvelling at every aspect of the movie: acting, screen writing, direction, costumes, settings, music, cinematography. thinking about it now, i still can't of anything i'd criticise it for. huston just knew how to tell a good story.<br /><br />a good deal of credit should also go to tony huston. he knew better than to meddle with a text that is not only perfection itself but already visual enough for cinema. father and son let the story breathe and relish in the long, fascinating conversations between characters, and in the meaningful silences.<br /><br />donal mccann also deserves credit for the his performance as gabriel conroy. i had never seen him in movies before, nor have i seen him afterwards, but he gave one of the most moving performances i've ever seen.<br /><br />all in all, the dead is a fine cinematic experience, from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent.
