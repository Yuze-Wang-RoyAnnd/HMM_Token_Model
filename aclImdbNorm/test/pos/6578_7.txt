paha maa is different finnish film. but the things which makes it different are copied abroad. some techniques of narration are from amores perros, jackie brown and elephant. scenes are shot from different angles again. paha maa is a good movie, but it isn't so good that the hype tolds: "realistic movie, no happy end, and no commercial admissions." some actors did great job. sulevi peltola was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler. also jasper p"a"akk"onen shows his skills. but mikko leppilampi was so lame. he is so overrated actor, he's handsome and a nice guy, but not the best actor of finland. but if you like finnish movies, paha maa is worth to see.
