i wanted to love this movie. everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable, if not groundbreaking, film. it was set in southern france, good-looking and recognizable actors led the cast, and i really admired the vibrant african costumes, the proverbs and music. despite all this, i didn't love it. movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing, but "secret laughter" doesn't do that. nimi and matthew, as played by long and firth (both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better), radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish. i used 'dried fish' deliberately, because it was one of a few - too few - strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the film. another winner was when nimi catches matthew snooping around her apartment. he finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says: "your name is nimi. i never knew." then he insists that she call him by his christian name. i watched this scene intently as matthew asked nimi over and over to "say my name", realizing that up until that moment, they always called each other by their last names. i thought this was a turning point for the film, and expected that it get better. it didn't. why do nimi and matthew always seem to stand at ten paces, even in that "say my name" scene? what does matthew like about nimi, aside from her obvious beauty? and why would a sensible woman like nimi fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic 'adventure' comes along? and i'd like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery. yes, jenny is a vicious harpy, but if i were in her shoes, but i'd probably match her cruella tactics to stop my husband from straying. believe it. the story hints at nimi's painful past, but never fully explores it. some critics say firth seemed a little awkward here, and i agree. for goodness sake, the actor summoned more palpable longing and passion as that early 19th-century snob mr. darcy (and while wearing those hideous britches)! as for long, who did shine in 'love jones', there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character. even so, there were many moments
