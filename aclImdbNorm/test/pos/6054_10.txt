i would purchase this and "thirty seconds over toyko" today if available. i also saw this movie after seeing large billboards of jack webb in his dress blues on the highway at the age of 12.always admired jack weeb as a john wayne type and american all the way. almost became a marine just because of this movie but served instead in the air force, air force reserve and army reserve for 32 years. have not seen this movie on tv at all and would love to own it on dvd. at least if it was on tv i would copy it to vhs and use it until available on dvd. i also have a large collection of wwii and korean war movies and always look for new releases on dvd.
