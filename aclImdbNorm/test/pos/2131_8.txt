though this film destroyed director and screenwriter michael cimino's career and bankrupted united artists, it still stands as one of the top movies of all time. there are plenty of reasons to prematurely dismiss this movie for sure. among them: its length, its technical problems, its colossal mistreatment of animals on set -- the list goes on and on. and yet, for all of this, it remains a film that captures something. it is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling on par with strindberg -- its moments lasting as long as they might in reality, having not been dumbed down for good cinematic timing. it feels real in its moments of anger, love, and war (and hopelessness). this film should be seen by any person who appreciates film and storytelling.
