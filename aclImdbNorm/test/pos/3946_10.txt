the weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling, plots often coming out of nowhere. but it really didn't matter because i still enjoyed it to it's full length. once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then you'll enjoy it even more. it's basically a love story, a confusing one at first but as it evolves it really is something worthwhile. sure it's been done so many times before but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touching.<br /><br />the over the top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first but i still enjoyed its purpose. and people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies!! guess what we know!! and it doesn't really matter because its purpose was to humour and entertain. sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping about. comparing this to hollywood standards is utterly stupid and ignorant, it's a totally different style and target audience. as far as i'm concerned some the best films i've feasted my eyes upon are from eastern producers and directors. there's your police story 4,shaolin soccer, kung fu hustle, dragon tiger gate, fist of legend, hero, crouching tiger etc...i for one like this movie and haling from the philippines, us, england, libya and now australia, i'll always be interested in these types of films. now try and judge my perception, but i warn you i do see things from from the point of view of those 5 countries i've lived in. so you better be as experienced and open minded.
