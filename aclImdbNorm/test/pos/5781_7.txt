i have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my university's art museum. on occasion, well, more like half of the time, i am unable to watch the films there. i have systematically attempted to view each of the films that i have missed. so far plagues and pleasures on the salton sea and who killed the electric car? are the other films that i have had to watch this way. the film covers an intriguing subject matter and is well-theorized (emphasis on this later) but not as successful as plagues and pleasures, but far superior to electric car. <br /><br />the film's thesis concern's the future of the american concept of suburban living. it questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. so, the film discusses the origin of the suburb, and it's evolution until the early 2000s. one theme the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants. while several people may live together, they do not "know" each other as we define the word. this, to me, represents the strength of the film: its appeal to actual human emotion. we are able to understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their argument's legitimacy. this is also one of the reasons salton sea is such a wonderful documentary. <br /><br />unfortunately, suburbia loses its message in firebrand explanation in support of its central argument. as those interviewed speak, their arguments become progressively more akin to those made by militant environmentalists. we are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade, but are given no scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc) in support of this claim. we are given little information as to how this date was calculated. fortunately, this was the only significant flaw that i was able to detect in the film's argument yet it's a glaring one nevertheless. another less-important discrepancy i noticed was the liberal (political) bias which could polarize some viewers. however, this bias is revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. the clips, especially those from the 1950's, seemed a tad unnecessary to me. the film was no better with their presence, and would have been more concise in their absence. <br /><br />as i thought more of this film before composing this review, i thought about why i found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that i'd recently viewed. finally, i realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem. they propose a decentralized village-system where pockets of people would live together. they posit this practice would lower the necessity for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. they define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas, for instance. what is incredible about this supposition is that it's actually conceivable. most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so. thinking more about the film, i decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why i give it a favorable review. <br /><br />while neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation, the end of suburbia is a worthwhile investment of one's time. it not only addresses the contemporary problem of sprawl, but it also provides realistic insight on how to amend it. the audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950's spliced with the modern arguers. people living in atlanta, georgia or the triad region of north carolina will particularly enjoy this documentary as sprawl is the most established there.
