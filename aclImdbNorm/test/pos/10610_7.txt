mention bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky, over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes vegas seem a bastion of conservatism. this perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached bollywood from an outsider's perspective. willard carroll's romantic comedy marigold, however takes a different tack. it is not a nudge-nudge wink-wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousness.<br /><br />it is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects. and if you have a familiarity with bollywood, you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of bollywood and hollywood movie conventions. from one of the opening shots, a flashback of the salman character as a child by the sea, talking with his grandmother (played by helen! - how many salman movies start with this same premise?) to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that marigold and prem has been filming, anyone who has seen enough bollywood movies will recognize these references. the story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both hollywood and bollywood as well
