distributor: goodtimes home video <br /><br />plot: a pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for tv movie. gail osborne is new in town. she makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. that is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting. after more and more phone calls, she is raped. throughout most of the movie, she tries to find proof that the person did rape her.<br /><br />audio/video: this 1987 vhs edition from goodtimes stinks. there are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen.<br /><br />extras: no extras from goodtimes home video.<br /><br />final thoughts: this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). if you can find this movie with the worldvision home video logo on the front, then buy it. but the goodtimes version is pretty crappy. this can be a little boring, but if you are patient, the ending is pretty good.
