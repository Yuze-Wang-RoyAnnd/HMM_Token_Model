i love this movie! i know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but i really disagree. the comedy is classic mel brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. this was my first exposure to cary elwes, and dave chappelle and what a first impression they made. cary elwes shines as robin hood, the only british robin hood mind you. he has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. dave chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as achoo. the characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. i highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
