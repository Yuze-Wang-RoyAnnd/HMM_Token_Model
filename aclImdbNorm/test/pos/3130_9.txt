watching the wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great ford films, like the searchers, my darling clementine, the man who shot liberty valance, and the grapes of wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. the story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of mormons get to california. along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some navajos. there's a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail, and the film is imbued with fun and beauty. the music is absolutely beautiful. the scenery, again from monument valley, is as beautiful as it ever was. plus, how can you go wrong with james arness? the wagonmaster might not be one of john ford's better known films, but it is nonetheless a must-see if you get the chance. 9/10.
