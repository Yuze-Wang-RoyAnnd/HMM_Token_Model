george hilton never really grabs me like franco nero or clint eastwood, but this is a great outing for him. basically rippin off the django/man with no name and doing a damn good job. the opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. fans of the genre will be in heaven.
