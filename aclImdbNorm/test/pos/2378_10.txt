four unhappy women leave dreary london to spend an enchanted april in a castle on the coast of italy.<br /><br />elizabeth von arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. all the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.<br /><br />the actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. ann harding is the free-spirited wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquillity' far from foggy london. katharine alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle. jane baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers. jessie ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past.<br /><br />the men in the story are also well cast. as miss harding's husband, frank morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. reginald owen, as miss alexander's spouse, is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for england (his hilarious attempt to take an english bath in an italian bathtub is made even funnier with the assistance of charles judels & rafaela ottiano as the castle's harried servants). finally, ralph forbes, one of the decade's finest forgotten actors, is joyously eccentric as the ladies' lighthearted landlord.<br /><br />movie mavens will recognize an uncredited ethel griffies playing the proprietress of the hampstead housewives club.
