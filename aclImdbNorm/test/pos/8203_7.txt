when "the net" was first being advertised, the ads made it look ridiculous. then, when i saw it, it was actually quite good. angela bennett (sandra bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors. then, through a series of events, her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people, and she can't prove that she exists.<br /><br />some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie. still, it's a good look into what the existence of the internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people. i do recommend it.
