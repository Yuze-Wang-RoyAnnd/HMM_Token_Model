gary cooper is a cool headed guy. always liked his easy going level headed characters. as some others have commented, there are some oddities in the script, such as a us marshall who got his job and can't even hit a barn with a pistol. a rancher with about thirty hands but can't seem to keep his cattle from being run off.<br /><br />but there is plenty of the quick thinking, straight shooting cooper to keep you entertained.<br /><br />this movie was made in 1950. people in their 20's and 30's have trouble understanding those movies were made for entertainment not oscars. <br /><br />to expect oscar material does this film injustice. it is about the good guys finding a way to round up the bad guys.<br /><br />so rent, borrow, or buy this movie, pop some corn and enjoy the coop one more time.
