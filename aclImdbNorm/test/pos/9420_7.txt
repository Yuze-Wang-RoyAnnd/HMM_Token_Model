it's one of the paradoxes of basil rathbone's wartime anti-nazi sherlock holmes films (voice of terror, sh in washington, and this one) that while the plots and settings are mostly terrible, he is so good in them. despite a bizarre wind-swept hairstyle meant to make him look younger, he blazes through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly register how flimsy the plots are. here he also has great acting rapport with lionel atwill, who makes a wonderfully repulsive professor moriarty -- a heavy lidded cockroach with nice hints of sadism and depravity (it may not have been acting, kids). at the climax, changed into a lab coat in order to drain rathbone's blood "drop by drop," he's as over-the-top sinister as seinfeld's arch-nemesis newman. the movie itself is ancient kiddie matin'ee fare, but it benefits from director roy william neill's attention to staging and atmosphere. it also looks fairly sharp in the dvd's ucla restoration -- don't even think of buying any other edition, all of them faded, choppy public-domain prints.
