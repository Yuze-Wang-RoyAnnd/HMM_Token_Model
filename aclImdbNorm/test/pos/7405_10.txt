i had never heard of silverwing before, then i saw it on toon disney and instantly loved it! i also think that it is not just for kids, and that people of all ages would enjoy it. it has a great plot, great effect, and cool characters. i will always love the show, and i heard it will be coming on on dvd worldwide soon, and i'm going to get it! i haven't read any of the books, but i intend to. the show deserves a 10 out of 10, and i hope the books are just as good. well, that's all i have to say. but i still have 2 lines i have to fill up, so...who do you all think is the coolest character? mine is shade, and my second favorite is marina.
