well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected. it's not boring and it's not unoriginal. it's really not a silly romantic comedy. the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual, of course, we're still talking about a movie, but the main characters are indeed plausible. donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something. the ending isn't one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre. i genuinely liked it and i'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. it's worth a watch. besides, it's better directed than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. and they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact, yada, yada. at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all, the movie makes you feel something, you may even learn a thing or two. it's not the usual hope-producing, tissue moistening idiocy. it's a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around the world.
