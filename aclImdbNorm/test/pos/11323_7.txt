the bbc and hbo teamed up to create "dirty war", a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist "dirty bomb" attack in london. the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti-terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots. on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation. on the government side we see pr and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response, and follow up. the film also imparts a sense of how al-qa'ida type terrorist cells are organized, the radical islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies. a sort of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "dirty war" will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat.
