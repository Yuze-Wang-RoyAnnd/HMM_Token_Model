now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. i really like bruce's style and persona, i haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.<br /><br />the story begins..... he is power, confidence and style with a capitol 's' . he drives a porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. that's russell duritz. he is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it. his acclaim, he is russell duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. it just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation-ally set, there is a problem, an intruder at his home, the alarm has been activated! <br /><br />russell can't seem to figure out (for the moment) what is happening to him. it's different and yet it is somehow familiar. a small boy, who looks exactly like....-- him. as their lives run smack dab into each other, there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him, "you have unfinished business to take care of, now!"<br /><br />amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life. she works with him, puts up with his 'ego' and yet, she is smitten with russell. very much so. with rusty his past 'self' now in the picture and talking a mile a minute, singing too late at night, everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly! <br /><br />willis is fun, egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable disney modern times classic 'the kid' and to add his little heavy-duty side kick spencer breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure. chi mcbride is an inspirational supporting character, as he is the heavy-weight champ, teaching 'little' rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground. <br /><br />all in all this is a real winner of a movie with even lillie tomlin as the secretary and aide to russell. i originally saw this back in 2000' and then again years later, with equal enjoyment. this is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any disney fan recommended highly (*****)
