so well done. the photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. it's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--i loved it and i'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. it's the best performance that i've seen from ms. capshaw--she's been in more movies than i thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. i suppose it's a plus to have spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically. two of the cast have successful t.v. shows of their own now--it's easy to see why. tom selleck does his usual good job.
