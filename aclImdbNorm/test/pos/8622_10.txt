i liked the movie but it should have been longer. the actors did a great job. portia de rossi is a fabulous actress and kristoffer polaha is a hottie. he didn't look like john at 100% but he did favor him from a distance. i look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. he didn't have john's charisma, but he definitely has a charm about himself. he has beautiful eyes and a great smile. he reminds me of my boyfriend alot. ms. bissett was just too breathy for me. she should have that asthma checked out. im not going to comment on the darryl hannah character. my mom always said, "if ya can't say anything nice, then shut the hell up!" so that's what im gonna do.<br /><br />molly
