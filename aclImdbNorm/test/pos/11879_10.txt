i just do not see what is so bad about this movie. i loved this movie! i thought this movie was the best film in the series. though part 3 is the best in the series,i still gave this film 10 out of 10 because it is great. i don't see what everyone hates this movie. who would not want to see just a little bit of critter action. i wished that brad brown would of appeared in this one because it might of made it a little better. those who like a little bit of drama because...wait i won't tell you,you will just have to watch it. this film also contains a few popular actors who are...(i won't tell you because i hate it when people give spoilers so i do not want to be one of those people). well i guess that is all i have to say about this movie.
