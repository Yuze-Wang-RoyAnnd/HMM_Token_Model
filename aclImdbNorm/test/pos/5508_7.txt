everyone told me this movie was downright not good, and sick etc. so i finally rented it and i was amazed . i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse, but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it. i wouldn't call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the lambs and/or kiss the girls. it did get stupid at times, but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10<br /><br />rated r - for strong torture, violence, language, and sexuality
