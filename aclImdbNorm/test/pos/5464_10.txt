captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains. the movie follows the plight of david letterman and jay leno as they struggle for the elusive tonight show spot. letterman led by his desire for the coveted time slot and leno led by his agent and little-devil-on-the-shoulder, helen kushnick.<br /><br />kathy bates (kushnick) is excellent in this movie, alienating herself from such top dogs as bob wright, warren littlefield, and howard stringer. towards the end of the film you are so entranced with how she handles every situation from guest bookings to delayed taping, that you find yourself wanting more.<br /><br />john michael higgins (letterman) plays his part to the tee. at times i found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real letterman.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations.
