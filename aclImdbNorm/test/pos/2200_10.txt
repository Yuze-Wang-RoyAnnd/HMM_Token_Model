i saw "sweeney todd" on broadway in 1980. it starred george hearn and featured most of the other cast principals who appeared in the national touring company production, which was videotaped for tv in los angeles in 1982. last night i watched the new dvd release of the los angeles production, although i have owned the videotape for many years. the production and the performances could have hardly been better but the original tape's age showed because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards, even on a newly pressed dvd. nevertheless i still give it 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of the work and george hearns's and angella lansbury's startlingly wonderful performances. even today, my most memorable recollection from a live musical theater performance has to be hearn's rendition of "these are my friends." "you'll drip rubies," brrr.
