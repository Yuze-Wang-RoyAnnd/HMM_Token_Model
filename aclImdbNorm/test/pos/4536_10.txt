this is one of my favourite comedy films. chris farley is hilarious as the accident prone moron and david spade is perfect playing the straight-man to farley.<br /><br />the dialogue between the two of them is brilliant. the scene where the two of them are in the car singing along to superstar by the carpenters is a classic.<br /><br />chris farley was a great comic actor who had amazing potential - he will be sadly missed.<br /><br />
