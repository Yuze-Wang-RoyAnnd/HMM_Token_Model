i expected fame to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite. the overall plot which follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential. however, fame builds its characters up beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when its over. i was very surprised when the graduation scene pops up -- we thought the dvd had skipped or something. all of the characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends! you might think there are too many characters, but its probably too many scenes. its evident the film was cut up and shortened because its sometimes lacks transition. i think laura dean as lisa monroe is my favorite character. i really connected with her character's ambition and following her heart. boyd gaines as michael, the stereotypical poor student who can't read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. i didn't especially like irene cara's character of coco, but this is not cara's fault since her script is weak and her character is not fleshed out. her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs warrants watching the whole film. in summary, the film could use many improvements, but the quality actors and great music earn its place in film history.
