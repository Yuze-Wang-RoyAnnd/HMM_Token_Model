this is burt reynolds'"citizen kane".tragically nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching "sharkey's machine".it seemed to me that he put everything he had into it.it is a movie that is in love with movies.the opening sequence where detective sharkey single-handedly rescues a bus-load of hostages is an immensely exciting piece of cinema. everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong that it appears to take on a life of its own,a brilliantly achieved effect. it looks cold,tense and dangerous on mr reynolds' streets. the precinct house looks dirty and tired,full of desperate people on both sides of the law,shouting,cursing out,trying to do deals or just stay alive.into this underworld descends the recently demoted sharkey - a reward for a bungled drugs bust(caused by a corrupt cop) - he and his team are part of the vice squad.information they pick up concerning a crooked politician leads them into the world of high-class call girls and ruthless drug barons. watching the apartment of one such call-girl(rachel ward)sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall(i know,i know)and when a woman's body is found with its face shot off in one of the rooms,he thinks its her.(well,i did say it was a movie that loved movies). the scene where she walks in on him works beautifully,even if you have seen the original. the film is full of good touches,i particularly like charles durning's war story,subtly acted and shot in sharp contrast to sharkey's abduction and torture which is suitably harsh and brutal. i must mention vittorio gassman and henry silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. they are "full on" every time they're on screen and are no loss to society when their time comes,mr silva's end being extra special indeed. as has been mention,this is a clint eastwood movie that clint never made.the biggest compliment i can pay "sharkey's machine" is to point out that in my opinion clint eastwood couldn't have made a better job of it. the soundtrack is of an equally high standard,featuring sarah vaughan,joe williams,julie london,chet baker and other top class artists. randy crawford's "street life" plays behind the title sequence,and i can never hear it without ,in my mind's eye,seeing sharkey striding along the sidewalk. like other correspondents i have never understood why this film was a bit of a flop.i hope it is due for a critical revision,particularly at a time when so many cop movies and shows without a quarter of its energy , freshness and sheer joie de vivre are lauded from the rooftops. if you're ever tempted to think of burt reynolds as a burnt - out one - trick pony,put "sharkey's machine" in your video machine.i promise you won't be disappointed.
