my architect is a great film about nathaniel kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous architect father, louis kahn, dead since 1974. the film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.<br /><br />i had never heard of louis kahn prior to this film, although i was vaguely familiar with some of his work. through the words (both good and bad) of louis kahn's colleagues, you get a very good sense of what nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold. sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling nathaniel how to feel about his father. as i listened to each recollection, my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in the span of a moment, so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that nathaniel's emotions must have been riding.<br /><br />the final sequence in bangladesh totally made the film for me. the reverence of which the people of bangladesh spoke of louis kahn's work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me, and, hopefully, for nathaniel.<br /><br />i think nathaniel kahn finally found what he was looking for.
