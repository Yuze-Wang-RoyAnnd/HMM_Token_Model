it's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but "sexual harassment" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, pass'e way. i love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of manhattan with johnny mathis singing "the best of everything" on the soundtrack. i want to jump right into some scenes, filmed on n.y. streets, circa 1959 & experience a time i've only seen on film & in photographs. some scenes in this movie reminded me of melanie griffith's "working girl". especially when hope lange (who's a cross between grace kelly & dolores hart) gets bombed in handsome stephen boyd's apartment, he tucks her in & just watches her sleep (like melanie, she wants to know if "anything" happened between them the following day). joan crawford is definitely comparable to sigourney weaver's horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty (with a soft core), but sigourney's character was sweet on the outside & horrible on the inside. i found it distressing how the suzy parker character (gregg) started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress, who supposedly didn't need a man to complete her, ended up. she becomes a stalker/lunatic/nut-job when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after he's done with her. i loved the character mary agnes, the office gossip, with her thick new yawk accent. if you enjoy films like "valley of the dolls" you'll like this one too.
