humphrey bogart in his first starring role looks very young, acts well, but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in his career. still, he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor.<br /><br />dorothy mackaill is the real star here, playing a once-rich woman who's torn between her real love for bogart (he's broke too) and the comfort and security of marrying an older man (hale hamilton).<br /><br />along for the ride are astrid allwyn as bogart's trampy sister, bradley page as her would-be producer, barbara leonard as the cosmetologist, jack kennedy as gilligan, and halliwell hobbes as the faithful (and wise) butler).<br /><br />both mackaill (whi had been a star in silent films) and bogart were trying to gain a toehold in talkies in 1932. bogart was a slow-rising actor from the broadway stage; mackaill was slipping and would soon appear in skid-row production like picture brides. yet they are both very good here. mackaill wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this film!
