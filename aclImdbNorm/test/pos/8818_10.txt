all in all, big bad john was a hilarious, and touching movie. if you want romance, tragedy, and humor, this movie's got it. if you're a fan of the song (like i am) you pretty much know how it ends. but if you don't, or do and want to watch it anyway, i strongly recommend this movie. jack elam and jimmy dean are a hilarious pair with great chemistry. however, i wouldn't recommend this movie to strict urban folk. you have to understand where these people are supposed to be coming from, and only a handful of us are left. but even a few urban folk might understand it, and appreciate it for what it is: a good, down home movie that'll make you laugh, cry, and be inspired.
