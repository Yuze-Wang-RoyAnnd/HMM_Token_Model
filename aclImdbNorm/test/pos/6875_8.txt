matthau is a widowed hospital doctor enjoying his single status and the footloose and available nurses on the staff whilst colleague and friend richard benjamin looks on with amusement and amazement. their boss is hard-of-hearing going on senile chief of staff art carney who is up for re-election to that post.<br /><br />matthau is content playing the field without commitment until he meets single mother glenda jackson who insists upon being the only woman in his life while she is in his life. at the same time, he comes under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential litigant in a malpractice suit, and to support the shambolic and incompetent carney in his attempt to be re-elected chief of staff.<br /><br />this is a superior old-fashioned romantic comedy graced by four grade-a actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first-rate dry, caustic and sarcastic script. carney steals every scene he's in and, in the parlance of imdb, has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen. we are otherwise entertained by the on-off relationship of the two leads and various sub-plots.<br /><br />lacks the ambition to be a great film, but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re-watchable for its comedic value alone. deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the dvd or video cassette.
