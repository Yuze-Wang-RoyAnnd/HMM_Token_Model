i just got home from seeing "radio." i've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time. my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may "feel" the message as i did - you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are, not judge them for their differences. cuba gooding, jr. and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie. i don't know why we can't have more movies like this, rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis.
