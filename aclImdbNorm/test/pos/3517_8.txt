just before dawn really surprised me when i saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than i expected. instead the director jeff lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until i was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. the lack of action in many parts gave it a very deliverance mixed with the texas chainsaw massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory. the characters are about par for this kind of movie, though more sympathetic than some, and the bad guy memorably freaky. the photography and suspense are the real winners in this movie and they keep it from ever being dull (as has been suggested). i firmly recommend this one to serious horror fans. don't expect gore, do expect a creepy backwoods tale with several awesome moments and a great dreamlike ambiance.
