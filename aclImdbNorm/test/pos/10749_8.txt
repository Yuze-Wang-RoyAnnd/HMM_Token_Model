this production was quite a surprise for me. i absolutely love obscure early 30s movies, but i wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. if, by any chance, you're not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the finale. of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical. a fascinating viewing experience, but i think the cat's paw is not available on video/dvd yet. watch your pbs listings!
