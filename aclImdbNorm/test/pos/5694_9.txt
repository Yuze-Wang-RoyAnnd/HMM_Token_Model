warning: i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.<br /><br />this movie was on the shelf at a movie store and since i had seen a handful of very corny horror flicks there i had really low expectations for this one. well, i put it in, and almost immediately i was sucked right in. while watching, i got deeper and deeper into the story and pretty soon i was staring in complete interest. this movie is surprisingly spectacular and i loved every second. the story is about a boat ride down a river in australia. it seems safe enough until their boat is ambushed by a croc who's ready for some food. when i looked at the back of the case i thought that this movie was going to have crappy visual effects like in lake placid 2 and a lot of others, but when i first saw the crocodile it looked amazingly real! don't laugh when i say this, for i am being serious, but this is one of the most creepiest films i've ever seen. it really knew how to build up nail-biting tension and suspense with it's intense situation, i mean, think about it; your stuck, in a tree, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. you can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little. it even managed to give me a few chills down my arms, like when adam was taken by the croc and grace and lee are left baffled. this is a very appealing movie. there were maybe 1 or 2 parts where i found myself slightly uninterested but other than that, i would say this is my favorite animal attack film that i have seen.
