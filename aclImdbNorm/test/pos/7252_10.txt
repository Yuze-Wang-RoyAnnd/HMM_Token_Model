this movie is great. stylish, fun, good acting. i'd seen it described variously as 'lock, stock and two smoking muskets' and 'reservoir fops', both of which are excellent descriptions. the plot is simple, but it does not detract from the enjoyment. carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and miller is an excellent drunken gentleman. the sets and costumes are stunning, and the music and camerawork are refleshingly unusual for a 'costume drama'. sense and sensibility it definitely is not!!!!! my recommendation? go see it, sit back with a huge tub of popcorn and have a damn good time.
