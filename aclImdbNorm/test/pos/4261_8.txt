putney swope is the story of a token black man on the board of directors of a large advertising firm who is accidentally voted chairman of the board when the owner of the firm keels over while trying to stutter out an idea that he was apparently quite excited about. putney, of course, takes his new role to heart and fires most everyone in the agency, hires a new crew (all black except for a token white guy) and proceeds to crank out the most offensive and non-pc commercials one could ever ask for. now it's a rather motley crew he has and despite that they somehow manage to be successful while raking in the cash. i rather like the scene where potential advertisers are being relieved of bags of cash and then told to "get out". and their commercials will follow later, like them or not. the story is good but of course the highlight here is the nasty commercials themselves, especially the one for "face off" acne cream. this is rather dated, but still a fun movie, and full of hilarious moments. robert downey sr. was working for an ad agency doing experimental ads at the time and i guess this was his middle finger to madison avenue agencies. very good and pretty damned funny. 8 out of 10.
