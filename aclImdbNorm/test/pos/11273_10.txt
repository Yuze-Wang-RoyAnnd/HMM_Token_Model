i loved it, it was really gruesome and disgusting. i thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly provacative. the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about jesus christ was really interesting. the tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome. don't watch this if you have a weak heart, you wouldn't be able to stand it.
