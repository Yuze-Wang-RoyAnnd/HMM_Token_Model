this is one of the better sci-fi series. it involves character development, a few really tensionate moments and reasonable episode scripts. as one other commentator said here, it looked as if it were a mini series, not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgets.<br /><br />the problem with the show, which in short is a godzilla series, is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, then it all boiled down to local americans doing stuff. then, the show ended too soon, since the olympics were coming and hey! a sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half naked athletic people running around aimlessly is much more important. so they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22. the audience was small, too, as people didn't really caught it on at 20:00. in the end the suits did it. trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promising.<br /><br />conclusion: you have a show with good special effects, stuff like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats, then going into genetic engineering, transforming people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. also, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity. the down-side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. no real ending, no closure, just a bitter taste of cloth in one's mouth, as if you just swallowed a piece of suit.
