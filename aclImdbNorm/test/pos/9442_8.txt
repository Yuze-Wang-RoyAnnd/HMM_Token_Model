if you want to really terrify people, choose the devil as your subject. after all, a good deal of the population believe that he is real. therefore you are plugging into a whole meaty swathe of pre-existing religious and mythological imagery. and bound to cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience.<br /><br />this episode had all the appearance of a hollywood blockbuster. in fact, having finished watching it i flicked over to another channel which was playing a recent bond film and quite frankly couldn't split a hair between the differences in sfx. with a minimal cast, restricted by its situation on a space station; complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an imploding universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as alien or event horison. the black hole outside made it feel as if the black hole's weight of dark matter was pressing the station onto the planet and to whatever was sealed inside. and as the horror is intensified by the knowledge that the dr and rose are stranded, the sinister ood start channelling a disembodied voice and then the characters start being picked off one by one...<br /><br />this has all the best qualities of the cream of this new dr who endeavour; girl in the fireplace and the empty child. emotionally engaging, frightening and humorous all without seeming cheesy. this is far scarier than any amount of flying daleks. but it has to be asked, is this really suitable viewing for children? this is not a family friendly episode. pity the poor parent who has to put their kids to bed after this one. i'm not sure i even want to see what happens next!
