where the rivers flow north is a well-told story about two peoples' fight to live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. besides enjoying the movie as entertainment, i also learned quite a bit about life in rural new england back in the late 1920s.<br /><br />the cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern vermont and set the stage, while the music brought the movie to life. very well done for a low-budget, locally-produced film. i found michael j. fox's character the weakest in the film, but rip torn and tantoo cardinal turn in two of the finest performances i've seen in a long time. i was saddened she did not get a nod as best actress that year (i assume the film was too "small" a film to be considered).
