this movie has it all. great actors, good dialog, drama, comedy, and excellent writing and directing by paul thomas anderson. i have seen this film several times and enjoy it more each time. it doesn't get old, it is consistently entertaining and stimulating. easily burt reynolds best role, and he does a great job. john c. reilly and don cheadle also give excellent comedic performances. there is not a weak element in this film.
