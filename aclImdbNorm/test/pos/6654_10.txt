"how can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" here's how. there have been few film versions of a celebrated novel that have done better justice to their source material than anthony minghella's movie of charles frazier's cold mountain. if you've read the book you will be able to feel most of the major scenes soul shakingly recreated. i personally cried numerous times while reading the novel and spent much of the evening watching the film through tears. <br /><br />astounding scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music. in the interview on the dvd accompanying the film minghella talks about the multiple layers of the story. all of them work. one of the best films i've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.
