wallace and gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted. the excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "a grand day out," "the wrong trousers," and also "a close shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. winning several oscars and also countless other awards, nick park became quite the popular man in the u.k., yet his impact on the united states has not been big. after the third wallace and gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length wallace and gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. then in 2000 instead of a full-length wallace and gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from nick park, which was chicken run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards. perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and gromit project.<br /><br />5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, wallace and gromit finally hits the big screen. despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. this film will be a delight for both kids and parents. with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already perfected and dreamworks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. despite the dreamworks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of aardman animations.<br /><br />wallace and gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. complications arise when wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. it is up to wallace and gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. to add to that, wallace wants to impress lady tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of victor. simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other wallace and gromit cartoons.<br /><br />in animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most curse of the were-rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. just picture the movie madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.<br /><br />casting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. peter sallis yet again does a wonderful job as wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (the wrong trousers: "it's the wrong trousers gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). ralph fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "fight club") lends her lovely voice as she plays wallace's love interest. even though nothing could top the final chase in "the wrong trousers," curse of the ware-rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between gromit and victor's evil dog. last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. the funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.<br /><br />bottom line: despite not being as memorable as "the wrong trousers", this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run. unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. there is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old virgin, wedding crashers, and sin city) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade. wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit: totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5,100.
