murder over new york is one of the better chan mysteries and i've just seen this for the first time.<br /><br />in this one, charlie chan is visiting new york to attend a police convention. at the same time, people who are involved with aircraft plants are being murdered and he decides to help with the investigation, along with his number 2 son. these murders turn out to be the results of sabotage at the aircraft plants and chan helps to identify the murderer...<br /><br />charlie chan is played well by sidney toler and the rest of the cast includes sen yung as his number 2 son and marjorie weaver.<br /><br />i rather liked this mystery and is worth having if you like this sort of thing.<br /><br />rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
