if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation, come on in!<br /><br />in this cartoon, popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat. the two japanese fishermen trick popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed. but looks can be deceiving; the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship! what follows is considered today to be morale-boosting propaganda.<br /><br />be forewarned, the representations of the japanese in the film are done in a mean-spirited fashion. keep in mind, though, that there was a war going on at the time. but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era.
