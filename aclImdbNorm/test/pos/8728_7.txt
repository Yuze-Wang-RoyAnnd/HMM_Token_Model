anyone who has ever doubted ingrid bergman's ability to play comedy need only look to "the bells of st. mary's". ok, so she's a nun with tb who's probably in love with fr. o'malley, (think what luis bunuel could have done with that), but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often. in "cactus flower" she's a starched dentist's nurse, (walter matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss but keeping it buttoned up. when she's forced to act as his 'wife' in order to hoodwink his mistress, (don't ask), she lets loose and the buttons pop. and she's a joy to behold.<br /><br />the movie itself is a hardier than usual translation to the screen of a broadway hit, (you can see it's three acts). it's a french farce, (it was originally; it's taken from the play 'fleur de cactas' by pierre barillet and jean-pierre gredy), and it hits all the right spots. matthau uses his great hang-jowl expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer, as she was then, called goldie hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for 'the wife' even though 'the wife' is having a ball. hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the academy award for best supporting actress.
