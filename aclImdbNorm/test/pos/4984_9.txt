this was a very good 1950s western, one of the better ones i've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv. it certainly had three big actors on the marquee: glenn ford, barbara stanwyck and edward g. robinson. it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles. ford had the bulk of the dialog. he also was the "good guy" while robinson was the "bad guy" and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson. she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times. <br /><br />ford handled his starring status very ably, as he usually did - especially in westerns. he played a nice guy who didn't want to fight, was a peaceful man......but if you pushed him.....look out!<br /><br />the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls, not overdoing either. it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the cineamascope widescreen. it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting. that credibility with the characters, especially the supporting players, was most impressive. the men way out-shined the women in this film, acting and character-wise. dianne foster and may wynn were weak - the only negatives of the production. it's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars.<br /><br />even though it is over 50 years old, this western is one you'd still find fast-enough moving to enjoy, no matter how old you are or what you're used to seeing. for classic film fans, this is almost a must with this cast and good story. highly recommended.
