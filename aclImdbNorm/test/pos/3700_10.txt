this is one of the finest tv movies you could ever see. the acting, writing and production values are top-notch. the performances are passionate with beverly d'angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and rob estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. however, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. it showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. it is thought provoking and entertaining. congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.<br /><br />
