who else other than troma can take the classic tragedy and change it around to todays standards???? no one....in my opinion the leonardo dicaprio one sucked. tromeon & juliet is a definite stretch from the original shakesperan tragedy, but it holds up well. its sick, demented, twisted, but yet insanely funny and fulfilling. for the most part it follows the true romeo and juliet story, but many troma elements are added. will keenan gives a great performance as tromeo. the acting is solid and the story is great. many people look past these movies, not only the kaufman troma movies, but all the ones they distribute. sure troma movies are an acquired taste, but you need to see some of these. it is renegade filmmaking at it's best.
