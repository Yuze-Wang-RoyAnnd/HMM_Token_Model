i managed to obtain an original bbc broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much i had to try and locate the original video in its original box; thanks go to ebay.<br /><br />deleted on any format since 1990, this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted. directed by stewart raffil (mac & me), the scenes of leaping tigers running through the alaskan wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger cubs is moving on each viewing.<br /><br />why no major company has picked up this movie to distribute on dvd is a big wonder; but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate.<br /><br />if you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection, make sure never to let it vanish out of your grasp. films of this calibre, as shown, don't come often.<br /><br />a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly worthy of its praised comments, "when the north wind blows" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.
