kahin pyaar na ho jaaye is a great family movie. salman khan is looking handsome and great than ever! there's even a scene where he takes off his shirt! what a surprise!!! rani mukherjee is great too. pooja batra had very few lines to say but i'm glad she has been acknowledged for her role because she definitely has potential.<br /><br />it's about prem (salman khan) and he is a wedding singer. he is about to marry nisha (raveena tandon) but gets stood up. prem goes to nisha's house and asks her why he was ditched and it's because her brother is ill and she needs to marry an nri, rahul (inder kumar), to get the money to get him treated. prem moves on and in comes priya (rani mukherjee). prem falls in<br /><br />love with priya but it's a shame she's about to get married to an nri! who could this nri be?! priya falls in love with prem too while rahul is there with her. prem gives priya an insulting comment one day and she goes off and sets off to agra for the wedding with rahul. will prem stop her? watch kpnhj to find out!<br /><br />the film was very funny! the songs were great especially the song "o priya o priya" it's a shame the film flopped in india and i don't know why?! every film in india is going flop nowadays!! this film deserved to be a hit. the only problem i found with the film is that they had an obsession about nri's! they think all nri's are rich! the film deserves a 9/10!
