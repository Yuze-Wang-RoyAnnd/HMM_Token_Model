many years ago i saw this movie (on television maybe?) and loved it. so i decided to rent it on dvd the other day to see whether it still held up in my estimation. it did. <br /><br />set in sydney's notorious king's cross district (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex stores thrive), it tells the story of "jimmy" (played by heath ledger). jimmy is a young man...maybe late teens or thereabouts, who hasn't had a stable family background. he is on the fringes of society, and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). he is aware of an underworld figure called "pando", who is a local bigwig in the cross. it's jimmy's hope that he will find himself on pando's radar and get 'in' with him...a short-cut to upward social mobility, he hopes.<br /><br />one night jimmy meets the beautiful young woman alex (played by the charming rose byrne). you just know that a love story will play out between them. on that night as well, jimmy is first contacted by pando (played by bryan brown). pando has a 'job' for jimmy. it's the 'foot in the door' that jimmy has been waiting for!<br /><br />to reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer. stylistically, if you like quentin tarantino or guy ritchie movies, you should be in tune with what to expect...twists and turns and black comedy.<br /><br />what's so great about this movie is its very 'australian-ness'. it's no mere knock off of tarantino or ritchie, but a genuine australian contribution to the genre. <br /><br />a fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together. sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell they're doing there. in the end, all these 'loose ends' tie together beautifully. it's sort of like a celluloid moebius strip.<br /><br />a highlight of the movie is bryan brown's character of pando. pando likes puzzles, and it's fun to see him play games with his cronies. it's the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyable...his taste in music, for starters!<br /><br />of the heath ledger movies i have seen (the dark knight, 10 things i hate about you), this is perhaps his best role. wasn't taken with "10 things". if you are a heath ledger fan (ledger recently died a tragic, accidental death), this is a chance to see him in his greatest australian role, i think. there is great chemistry between ledger and byrne in this movie-so, on one level, it functions as nice love story.<br /><br />this movie doesn't have some of the horror of tarantino and ritchie underworld movies, but it does have some adult themes...scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. in that sense, it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers, but it's not a movie that gore-hounds will get excited about either. <br /><br />lastly, i have to say that it is great that australia can make great movies like this. usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be uniniviting. this movie has strengths where many australian movies have weaknesses...i.e. it has a great story, great acting and a great script. we need more popular, quality movies like this to be made here in australia. <br /><br />highly recommended. other australian movies i have loved include:<br /><br />breaker morant (10/10) mad max 2 (10/10) my brilliant career (not reviewed here by me yet) proof (nr) the devil's playground (nr) the year my voice broke (nr) bad boy bubby (nr. a great, dark comedy) the dish (nr. a great, charming comedy)
