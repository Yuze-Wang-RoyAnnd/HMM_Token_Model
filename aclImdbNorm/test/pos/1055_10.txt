i came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. as you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. <br /><br />stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. dennis morgan's acting is strong also. he goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out kitty foyle. in this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos stanwyck away from her husband to be. <br /><br />this is a christmas classic. the settings and the story make for a great christmas romance
