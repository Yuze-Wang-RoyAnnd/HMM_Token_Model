many american pea-brains who worship and support the political half-truths of hucksters like michael moore would do well to sit through this movie more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can scare, intimidate and lie to an underinformed public and get the people they fear or loathe killed, spindled and mutilated. robespierre in this fine epic kills the opposition by remote control, all in a fit of self-righteous devotion to his principles. we get the impression that robes felt it quite justifiable to snip off his opponent's heads, even as he sent his minions out to trump up false and misleading charges against the state. today, the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive that robes...they merely murder your character with innuendo and false charges laid down without foundation or sources. witness dan rather's attempts to assassinate w's character on the eve of the 2004 election, or the constant drumbeat that the 2000 election was stolen, although constitutional scholars continue to scoff at such irresponsible drivel.
