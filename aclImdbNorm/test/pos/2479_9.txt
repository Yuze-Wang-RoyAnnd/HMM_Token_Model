as far as fake documentaries go (fakumentaries anyone?), this one is up there with the best! it looks very real and that is what it aims for. in recent light of events (guantanamo) this movie is even scarier, so you could say it was ahead of it's time, when it was released in the 70s! <br /><br />one can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist! looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that? of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same (70s mentality): screw the politicians and politics in general. maybe that wasn't so clever one might think ... but hey, don't forget: it's only a movie! ;o)
