of all the 48 films of brigitte bardot, "une parisienne" is widely regarded as (one of) her best. what we see is special: for once the plot has a value of its own, does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for bb's sex-charged appearance.<br /><br />this film is your true & well worked-out light comedy, with a good and coherent story. set in france's government circles in the late 1950's, it entertains from beginning to end. providing many amusing twists & turns and some slapstick -- all acted out by at least three starring leads, including bardot.<br /><br />"une parisienne" (= french for "female inhabitant of paris") focuses on telling a story, not on showing brigitte bardot. brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies.<br /><br />when you settle on your couch on a friday-night, tired and weary from a week's slaving away, just turn on "une parisienne". this film will make you feel better.
