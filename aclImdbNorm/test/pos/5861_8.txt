"murder by numbers" stars ryan gosling and michael pitt as two rebellious high schoolers who are content on the perfect murder for the sake of overcoming their shattered self-esteem. sandra bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way of their plans as det. cassie mayweather. this is nowhere near the traditional finger-pointing murder mystery as the film graciously reveals the killers to us (gosling and pitt). what the film does instead is concentrate on the purposes of their killings and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. <br /><br />the title itself is a rightfully chosen one for various reasons mainly being that the "numbers" in the title is the most vocal. the angle focusing on the reasons behind the heinous killings, although will haunt you with its chilling dialogue (especially from the callous boys), it doesn't fully live up exploring the origins of what lead them to their killing frenzy. the characters are riveting you have the good-looking rich kid richard (ryan gosling) and the intelligent but socially awkward justin (michael pitt). in school, they pretend that they despise one another, and even share a liking towards the a classmate name lisa (agnes bruckner), but off-school they are allies and collaborate in a ritual in which murder is an escape to free the mind. <br /><br />sure the story involving the boys seems exciting, but it's pushed in the background to a more mundane subplot involving det. mayweather (bullock) who assumes their murders was because of discrimination (hence the arrogant looks of gosling) and unexplained characteristics but manages to get it right. at first, the audience may despise cassie's character due to the fact she's very headstrong and not very supportive. she displays dominance and control over her junior partner sam kennedy (ben chaplin). even as he tries to reason with her, he knows it's a battle he surely won't likely win.<br /><br />the reason behind her tyrant behavior stems back in which cassie was the sad victim of a crime that has left a permanent mental scar on her. this side-story does not have much of a place in this movie partially because it doesn't offer anything riveting with the main plot (the boys' murder spree). it also offers some development to bullock's character in the movie but it's only a half-assed job and not very fulfilling. i would've liked it if they the diabolical students had a side-story. the resources were right there in front of them for the perfect crime foil, the creative schemes for the boys to manipulate the cops with their phony evidence and lies just to get out of a potential life-sentence in jail.<br /><br />despite the lopsided sub-plots and the pointless "real killer" ending, "murder by numbers" sports a strong performance by a great cast. sandra bullock was convincing as the tough verbally remorseless cop who tries to shift her inner pain to a more positive light. ben chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries every way to understand his partner and is able to fend off her occasional tyrannical put-downs. but the scene stealer's are the devilish duo of michael pitt and ryan gosling as they keep you glued to their seat waiting for what they're going to do next. the chemistry of the boys is reminiscent to matt damon-jude law in "the talented mr. ripley".
