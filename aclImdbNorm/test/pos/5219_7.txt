i don't like boxing, don't understand the attraction. i did like this movie. positive portrayals of latinos, with no drugs, sex or street violence. the plot actually showed stable, loving families. the fight sequences are violent, as is boxing, but not as over the top as rocky films. nothing wrong with attempting familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. it's a good rent.
