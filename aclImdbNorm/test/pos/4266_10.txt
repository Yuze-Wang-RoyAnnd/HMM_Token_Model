this is a film that everyone who lives in sweden should watch. the film shows the political riots who took place in gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. it features interviews with those who were convicted where those people gets the first chance after the riots, to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a so much better place to live in and be a part of. i react emotionally when i see this, since i just feel so mad about how those people were treated both during the riots but also after the riots.<br /><br />i hope as many as possible gets to see this movie, as it really gets your mind thinking: is this possible? in sweden, a democracy, in 2001?
