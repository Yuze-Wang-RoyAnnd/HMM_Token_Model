personally, i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, maybe the greatest. this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges, it can't be bad. and that's exactly what this movie is! "k-pax" is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years. to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story. it's part of what makes the movie so great. the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting. the combination spacey-bridges really works.<br /><br />this was already the second time i saw the movie and i'm sure it won't be the last time. "k-pax" has everything. there are moments which are extremely funny, parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high-class drama. i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards. great movie! <br /><br />9/10
