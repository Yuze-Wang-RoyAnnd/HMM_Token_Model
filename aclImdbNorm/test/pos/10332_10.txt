this film is a study piece for my english class, but it's depth and meaning has amazed me. since we're looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film, its and interesting tale of love, hate, war, and prejudice. well recommended!<br /><br />story: a girl named well-off jewish patty bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens, and as they get to know each other, they begin to see the others qualities, and they earn each others love. patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his cover to protect her, but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.
