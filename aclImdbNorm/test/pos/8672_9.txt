one of the best films i've seen in a long time, precise in its vision, and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization. i can't say much without giving it away, and i don't recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeing--just see it.<br /><br />but ah, one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on imdb. conundrum. what can i do? tell you about the film? nope. can't do it. i think i enjoyed this movie precisely because saw it with no preconceptions. please you do the same.<br /><br />i suppose this can be said: the acting is excellent and understated, and what i have come to love about foreign movies is that the movies are actually about the movies, not the stars.
