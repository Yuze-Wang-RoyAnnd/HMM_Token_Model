i may differ from many people on this board but i enjoy watching mind of mencia. the reason i like mind of mencia is the host is not afraid to speak his mind or exploit stereotypes. carlos mencia does what we all do with our friends but are unwilling to admit and then some.<br /><br />mencia has no problem doing jokes about any race, religion, sex, or orientation. while he gets a lot of flack for this it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. mencia does not care if he offends anyone but he is not a racist and even does jokes about his own race.<br /><br />the typical format for the mind of mencia goes like this: there will be an open skit making fun of a person or recent event. mencia then comes out and does a 5 or 6 minute stand up where he talks about various issues. the show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials. in these skits mencia does a variety of things such as making fun of people, giving his personal opinions with a funny twist, or simply doing parodies of people, events, or movies. at the end of the show mencia comes out for a minute with either one final skit or something else to say.<br /><br />people criticize mencia for exploiting stereotypes and say his statements are overly offensive. carlos only does what everyone else thinks of certain races but are afraid to say. as for mencia being offensive he is only speaking his mind. i find nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />the show is not perfect. the skits can be not put together the best and sometimes mencia does go over the line in his jokes. for the most part however it is a show where the comedian says what is on his mind no matter what the consequences and presents in in a humorous matter. so if you aren't afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak his mind and often say what you have wanted to say then watch mind of mencia. however if you are easily offended you should not watch this show because you will be offended or worse yet you might even laugh.
