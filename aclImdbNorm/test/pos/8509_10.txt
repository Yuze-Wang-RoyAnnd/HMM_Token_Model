many have disparaged never say never again because it is not an official bond movie. nevertheless, it is manifest that the producers adhered to the fruitful bond formula. although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the commencement of the film is meant to be the introductory scene. it would have been impossible for eon to stop the producers from including a pre-credit and title sequence, albeit without the gun-barrel introduction.<br /><br />sean connery is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than dr no, thunderball, you only live twice and diamonds are forever. although, nsna is meant to be a remake of thunderball, it is a vast improvement. 007 spends more time on terra firma and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film. <br /><br />there is some resplendent acting in this movie. barbara carrera is impeccable as the bizarre fatima blush. one of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between bond and fatima in nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. klaus maria brandauer plays the psychotic largo and max von sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying blofeld have indulged in.<br /><br />nsna tends to centre on connery rather than the character of bond. at the commencement it is stated that bond is ageing and has been out of action. this seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in connery's portrayal of bond. bond promises "never again" to work in the secret service; an allusion to connery's portrayal of bond. it appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise. <br /><br />nevertheless, this film is definitely worth watching. this is the last time that sean connery played james bond, but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said "never again".
