i liked this movie, not because tom selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face. i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.<br /><br />overall, it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the "dog day's" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away. a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good "date" movie
