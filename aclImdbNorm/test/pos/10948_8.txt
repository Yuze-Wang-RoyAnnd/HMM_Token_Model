like a very expensive buffy episode peppered with plenty of humor. lots of wire and stunt kung fu. the twins effect goes on the list of classic must see hk films. the vampires have a cool blend of hopping ghost type and the pretty boy european style. if you get the opportunity to see this one in the theatre it is worth a 30 minute drive, otherwise buy the import dvd before someone screws it up by giving it a bad dub.
