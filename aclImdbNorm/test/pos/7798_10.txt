i find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating. it is arguably one of the best comedies ever made, and surely the best bollywood comedy of the 90s. the film did not do too well on the box office and people had diametrically opposite reactions after seeing it. my guess is most people didn't expect it to be an all-out comedy and were expecting a regular movie. if you love comedies, this is a must-see. and aamir khan is outstanding.
