so totally unique and entertaining! another great canadian invention. a regular "joe"(dan) and a bunch of misfit delinquents (aka puppets), all share residence at a half-way house. its dan's job to keep an eye on four 'menaces to society' and help them to rehabilitate. bill, the homicidal dummy, rocko the cigarette smoking dog, buttons, the nympho teddy bear, and cuddles the comfort doll. the five of them find themselves in all sorts of odd predicaments. despite their homicidal, and often overtly perverse sexual tendencies, it's hard not to find them lovable.<br /><br />i give this show a 10/10 simply because it provides good entertainment, without needing a huge budget, and exudes a canadian flair that makes me proud.
