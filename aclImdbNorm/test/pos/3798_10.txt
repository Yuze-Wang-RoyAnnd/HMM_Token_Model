it's up there with where's poppa, the groove tube, putney swope. it memorializes the ny city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they "really are"... i don't think it is ever shown anymore. if so, surely someone would tivo the thing and put it out there. a kidnap goes awry: mixed up in a rain storm, dashing in and out or storefronts, our hero tosses a raincoat over his prey and tossing her into his bicycle powered ice cream wagon spirits her off to his basement apartment in the village. he is amazed, surprised, and incredibly disappointed when the wraps come off: instead of a luscious lady, he has captures a middle ages suburban housewife who talks and talks and talks. the film is full of vignettes of the commuters life, the suburban life, the city officials, and all the attitudes so dearly held. it pushes the limits of comedy, such as magical reality might push a drama, much as daffy duck is able to draw on imaginative scenes to demonstrate his plight or desires, all at the very edge of plausibility. all of it is humorous, nobody is mean.
