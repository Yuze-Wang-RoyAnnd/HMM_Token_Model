just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather steamed. this was a favorite of mine as a kid and i always watched it when it came on no matter how many times i saw the episode. sure the effects were not great, but they were also not horrible either. they did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70's vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70's. it did not really have any villains from the comics, but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics. spidey's powers were a bit different here too, he had his spidey sense and he could climb walls, but he was not nearly as strong as the spider-man of the comics. he was super strong though as i do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob off, he just was not the car hurler that the one from the comic book can be. the show was set in los angelos so there were not as man buildings to swing from, but they did okay with the web. it is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie. i love the movies, but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more smarty pants spidey that has the mechanical web shooters. this show had a good star as peter parker and he was okay as spider-man, it is nice to see a spidey who does not basically live in the slums like he does in the movies. neither this show nor the movie though has a spider-man that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic. still, this show was fun without being as corny as the batman show.
