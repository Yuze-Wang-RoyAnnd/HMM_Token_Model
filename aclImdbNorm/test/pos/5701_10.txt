a surprisingly good documentary. my surprise was mainly due to the fact that i was confused by the title. i assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected. demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. from, 'easy rider' and the collapse of studio influence, through all those introspective 'real life' movies, where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, through to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios. as someone who saw the 'real life' movies of britain and the rest of europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary us films of the 70s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day, this was a most fascinating film. the interview clips are measured (thanks to dvd the full interviews are available as extras!) and the film clips well considered. also, as someone who has only just caught up with, 'joe', i am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here.
