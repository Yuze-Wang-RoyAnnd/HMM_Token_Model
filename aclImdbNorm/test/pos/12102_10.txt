if you're a fan of turkish and middle eastern music, you're in great luck. this film is a documentary of current music in istanbul, spanning the traditional to the modern. it's very good. you could not do better if you went to istanbul yourself. we get interviews with orhan gencebay, concert clips of modern musical icons, a road show with a romani (gypsy) audience, turkish hip hop (surprisingly very very good), and much much more. some of the best female vocalists i've ever heard. a kurdish woman singing in a hamam (steam bath) who will rip your heart out. lots of social and political background. if this is your thing, you'll have a grand time. i could barely sit still in the theatre.<br /><br />cd soundtrack now available on amazon. pricey.
