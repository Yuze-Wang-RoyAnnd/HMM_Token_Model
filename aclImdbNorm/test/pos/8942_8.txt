wales seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently. actually, wales seems to be developing its own little film industry. i recently saw very annie mary, which i thought was very good. but plots with a view is not only quirky, it's laugh out loud funny, has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (brenda blethyn is amazing), and a plot that, while not entirely original, is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines. it was the kind of movie that i wanted to watch again immediately it was over, and one of very few that i would actually like to own. even though many of the characters are caricatures, and you have to have been to a welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the rapport between blethyn and molina is a joy to behold.
