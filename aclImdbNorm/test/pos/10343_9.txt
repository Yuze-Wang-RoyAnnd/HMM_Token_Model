great movie. good acting ,a wonderful script. it's exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in. a pity about the ending; a 'page' of text of how nynke's life went on, instead of moving images was a poor choice. i hope this movie attracts a lot of people; it's worth it!
