one of the best movies ever, the idea of a double interpretation involves we all. <br /><br />would be prot a schizophrenic or an e.t? (no doubt in my opinion, but let's keep the question open...). kevin spacey, the big screen monster, plays prot as it should be done. let's not forget jeff bridges and his great psychiatric. <br /><br />lastly, a masterpiece that speakes for itself. can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over. if you still didn't watch it, go right now! and again, again...
