a mixture of alien and ghost busters?<br /><br />starts very promising, then slows down to almost boring. <br /><br />lifeforce contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid 80's. the story is intriguing, but becomes quite lack lustre in the end. it was rated r because of the nudeness, sex and gore. mathilda may's ethereal and savage (naked) beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie. a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made. <br /><br />this could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a great hit, i think it actually flopped quite bad. <br /><br />so, something went wrong with this one, but still, it's very entertaining.
