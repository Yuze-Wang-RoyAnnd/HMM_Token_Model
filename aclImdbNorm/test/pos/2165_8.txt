though this is a good, enjoyable cartoon, they did much better ones later on, like carrotblanca. this is almost like the first star trek feature, which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what, just for existing. this is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches, but nothing special. reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless. available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits. recommended.
