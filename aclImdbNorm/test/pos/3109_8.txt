gosh, i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. for example, i had no idea who george cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. all i can say is..i really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. can that ever exist? well, in certain doses, yes...and this film let out in a bit on ... "how".<br /><br />being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. at the time, i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was...and how that would effect their friendship. through their men, their career, the decades that defined them. and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else...their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have.<br /><br />then i got older, studied film a bit... and watched this film again with my best friend from high school. we do understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still the best of friends...but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece...it can be seen as a bit campy at times...a little over the top at points (kinda on a 'dynasty' and 'dallas' level to me..) and honestly i can identify with the "teddy bear" scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men/careers, et al..so its not as over the top as it seems....! as many already said, seeing meg ryan and matt latanzzi and dack rambo and david selby are great in this 1981 piece. this is a nice "chick" flick!
