it is a shame that this series hasn't been remastered and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house.<br /><br />copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies.<br /><br />as i understand it, 92 episodes were produced during its run, but only 15 are noted here.<br /><br />some of the series writers, such as richard matheson, went on to become noted authors.<br /><br />excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced.<br /><br />michael weldon,<br /><br />udon thani, thailand
