i really can't see why people seem to dislike this film. i found it very entertaining (of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous laura fraser is a bonus!) when i first heard about it, i thought it would be along the lines of a role-reversed "weird science" and, to an extent, this is true, however there is a twist which i really didn't see coming. having seen the trailer on the dvd (which i hadn't seen before watching the film) i saw that the "twist" is actually shown in the trailer! very strange.<br /><br />as the film progresses the "weird science" comparison fits less and less, and i think this is the better of the two films. certainly there are some scenes which don't work wonderfully, but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young cast.<br /><br />in summary, i'd suggest that this is a fine example of a sci-fi chick flick, and i don't think i've seen many of them!
