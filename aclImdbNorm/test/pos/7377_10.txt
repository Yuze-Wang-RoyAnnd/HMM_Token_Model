i would like to say that i absolutely loved campfire tales! to me, it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending. as if the contents of the movie weren't scary or weird enough, you have the ending. it's a very awesome movie and i'm so happy that it's being released on dvd on august 30th.i will not hesitate to get my copy on that day.i don't think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have, because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge, but if it weren't for my brother telling me about the movie, i wouldn't have known. which stinks because in my opinion it's far better than any "scream", "i know what you did last summer", or any other horror for that time. so i hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference. i loved it, and being a horror movie junkie, campfire tales was like dessert for me!
