i generally love srk as a villain (how can you not?) and i believe that srk and juhi are a perfect match on screen as they both are actually more nice than pretty.<br /><br />this movie is great to watch, although it has some major flaws: <br /><br />1) the good guy (sunny) - not only he's so much less attractive than shahrukh(what in my opinion is soooooo important in bollyfilms) but his role lacks character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier <br /><br />2) kiran's and sunil's reactions for rahul's actions are unbelievably silly and naive even for a bollywood production <br /><br />but all this is not that important in comparison with the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really truly great)and (let's say it again) shahrukh as a villain, i just love him when he's so pagal<br /><br />a must-see (along with anjaam, baazigar and duplicate)
