we see a man move from city to "out-back" and change dramatically - his family asks questions, but he goes mad.<br /><br />strange, brilliant film for screening here in israel. wonderful locations, great actors, a film which masquerades as a "thriller" but which is more a case-study of madness in the lead man.<br /><br />the film was way above the other films screened as part of the aice festival here in israel. best of luck to the team who arrived at this film. it's a grand guignol, a little masterpiece of noir.<br /><br />my only criticism which prevents a "10" is that the sound and the music is overpowering at times. it tends to get in the way of the images, which speak for themselves.
