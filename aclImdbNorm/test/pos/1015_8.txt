i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's. i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre i'm not particularly interested in. the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's franco-italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. the scenery (the beautiful philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today. it is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures". i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy. a worthwhile moodpiece.
