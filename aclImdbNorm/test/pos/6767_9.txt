ok, so i'm not usually one that runs out and rents foreign movies...especially foreign dark comedies. i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end. this movie will be added to the short list. even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. but this one had my eyes welling up with tears. my sides hurt. i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was recommended by my mother and i don't think i would have even dreamed of watching it had she not raved about it. don't be afraid of having to read during your movie - you'll miss out on a hilariously well-acted flick.
