this film blew me away. i thought i knew a little about the attica prison riot. after watching this, i see i knew nothing. the story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. the flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. it's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. it was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in american history. i'm with ebert and roeper. i give it two thumbs up.
