i watched two very different holmes adventures this morning, but you would be amazed at the similarities.<br /><br />the was presumably the first collaboration between basil rathbone (if i were king, romeo and juliet) and nigel bruce, and director roy william neill. it was not their first sherlock holmes adventure, as they did one a couple of years before this.<br /><br />the made an excellent team, but i prefer the hammer version, which i will talk about later.<br /><br />holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his work, and i am constantly amused by the mannerisms displayed when they figure something out. they always seem to dash on when they find a new clue.<br /><br />the story itself about keeping a bomb site from the germans in wwii was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.
