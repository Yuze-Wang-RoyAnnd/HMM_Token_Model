surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an erasmus program. the beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though i don't agree with the notion that when you do erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. but that's just me. the movie is deep, and at the same time very light. cool and recommendable.
