i liked this movie. many people refer to it as "sabrina the teenage feminist". they do that with a lot of movies that melissa joan hart is in. still, she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the part of mary, who fights for justice when her roommate is raped. you could tell that hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed. i also liked lisa dean ryan as mary's roommate. she was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped. josh hopkins was good as the cocky and egotistical rapist. lochlyn munro convincingly played his character. the acting in this movie is better than in most tv movies, in my opinion.<br /><br />the movie was pretty predictable though. also, i expected more from the ending, it was too abrupt. the delivery could have been better. but the performances and overall plot make up for these problems.
