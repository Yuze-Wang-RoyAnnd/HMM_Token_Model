i finally got hold of lifeforce on dvd with the widescreen format intact and rousing henry mancini score to the max. after having viewed lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, i have to say that the 'uncut' dvd version was both great and disappointing. the u.s. version is so *much* better than the dvd (european?) version. the u.s. version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the dvd version is terrible. feels like an unfinished cut). and the many scenes not seen in the american version add little or nothing to the final problem. in fact one "new" moment almost destroys the entire movie, when caine (peter firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. i love this scene, in the u.s. version though. on the dvd, the male alien speaks to caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious. it's the pinnacle of hilarity:<br /><br />"it'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me!" the male alien says, in a deep 1950s style voice. i was floored when i saw this. it just doesn't belong in the movie. that scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. i'm glad hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in north america. there are several changes that were made for the u.s. version that make lifeforce that much better and i wished the dvd had the u.s. version. the editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the u.s. version are even more boring on the dvd version because of added scenes. and the opening credits on the dvd is terrible. much better in the u.s. version. more subtle.<br /><br />i love this film. it's basically aliens making a pit-stop over earth and sucking up as much lifeforce as possible. the film has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk) but when the action goes to london, it's fun. the film really shines in these scenes. one can see hooper finally doing what he's great at: chaos, savagery, horror! lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. they're the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. it's also the best zombie movie ever. the zombies are hungry (for lifeforce, not flesh) and they're crazed and agile and terrifying. not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies. also, a lot of people have criticized the ending but i love it. it leaves you high and dry, like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.<br /><br />and to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s, when people flocked to e.t. or cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. no wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!<br /><br />as for the dvd, well, it ain't great. the image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. but it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. i just hope that they'll release a clean, crisp u.s. version on a dvd, and with commentary by hooper and dykstra.
