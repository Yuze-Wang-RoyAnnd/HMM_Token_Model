i saw this when it first came out, and found it to be a work of some genius; but i must confess i was clearly in the minority at the time.<br /><br />for me, the progressive lunacy of the proprietors of guest house paradiso just gets better and better throughout the film, with one of the most hilarious climaxes to a film ever.<br /><br />but i wouldn't recommend it to mother.<br /><br />lovers of gross-out comic book style humour will appreciate this movie; there are subtle jokes hidden away, but they are usually quickly flattened by a comedy frying pan. rik mayall and ade edmondson are superb, and the deadpan, unsuspecting guests are also excellent.
