this is a very unusual film which starts out with a rich dude getting a brand new sports car for graduation and decides to take it for a spin in the local town. rich boy meets poor girl in 'mabels diner'who is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out. there is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the rich boy and poor boy wind up having to do community service as ordered by the town judge. rich boy and poor boy just do not get along and the rich boy winds up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girl friend. there are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. poor girl says, "some people go through life and never find love, i can say that i found love and am holding on to it". you will need some tissue's if you are sensitive, there are plenty of romantic scenes and i doubt very much if you will guess how this picture will end. the producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to a film. if you like true to life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, this is your film.
