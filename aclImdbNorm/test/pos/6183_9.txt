the lubitsch's touch is more than ever in this film. humour at anytime and very subtle. the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director. the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect. a real piece of comedy that isn't getting so old for a xxist century spectator. the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie. she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage, very funny. and no problem, with lubitsch, there is always an happy end. a film for men too confident with women. don't let your girlfriend watch this movie...
