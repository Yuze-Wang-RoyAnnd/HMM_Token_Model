charlie wilson (tom hanks) is a hard-partying, womanizing texas congressman with no discernible legislative record. in 1980, he finds himself becoming interested in the plight of afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the ussr. on the auspices of his old flame, arch-conservative texas socialite joanne herring (julia roberts), he travels to afghanistan to assess the situation, and is stunned by what he sees. he returns to the us determined to help the afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use. undeterred, wilson recruits herring and the vulgar, outcast cia agent gust avrakotos (phillip seymour hoffman) to begin a convoluted arms deal involving israel, egypt, pakistan, saudi arabia, and a mostly unknowing us congress. ultimately, the afghans defeat the soviets, but while america celebrates their victory, wilson and avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war afghanistan falling on deaf ears.<br /><br />charlie wilson's war is slick brain candy, a really neat film for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average film-goer. the movie assembles an astonishing array of talent, both in front of and behind the camera, and delivers on its promise of being one hell of a good time. the film's has only one flaw, which we'll arrive at later. as an examination of the improbable way in which the 20th century's largest covert war was waged - and, perhaps, the way that things get done by the cia and other intelligence agencies - it's fascinating.<br /><br />the movie is interesting on a number of levels. the story portrayed in the movie - with all of its outrageous double-dealings, sneaky covert operations, and, perhaps most of all, its success - would be so outrageous as a work of fiction, that it could easily be dismissed as a satire. but things really did work out this way, at least within reasonable bounds. the film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws. wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices (even embracing them) - yet willing to embrace a righteous cause. herring is something of an elitist, and her born-again attitude of righteousness is off-putting - yet she's deeply committed to the cause of the afghan people. avrakotos is a cia outsider with an attitude problem, looked down upon because of his "street" background - yet his love of country and hatred of communism are unwavering. the fact that this odd trio could play a major role in the downfall of the ussr is not only proof that anyone can make a difference, but also that truth is stranger than fiction. it's also very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy - not too surprising, given that our writer is aaron sorkin, but it's an interesting way to approach this story.<br /><br />the movie does, however, have one drawback, which is a bit surprising. the film seems to unabashedly celebrate wilson and co.'s achievement. this is fine - nothing wrong with defeating the soviet union, is there? - until one considers that out of the ashes of the soviet defeat in afghanistan came the taliban and eventually al-qaeda. regardless of the us's level of responsibility, it happened, and the movie's portrayal of wilson's success is almost unmitigated. to be fair, the movie does address this issue towards the end, with a rather topical speech by wilson about the us's inability to clean up after themselves, but it's done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take much from it. the overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the afghans defeat the soviets. this isn't a fatal drawback, mind you, but it's one troubling aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie. <br /><br />the film's talent is remarkable. the legendary mike nichols delivers a slick, gorgeous-looking production; the material is perfectly suited to his understated, wry directorial style. sorkin delivers yet another brilliant screenplay; the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic sorkin exchanges (the best being the "scotch bottle" discussion between wilson and avrakotos), and keeps something of a political and historical perspective behind it. the film's cast is a marvel: tom hanks gives a fine performance as the lovable rogue with a cause, julia roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the obnoxious but committed joanne, and phillip seymour hoffman steals every scene (par usual) as the abrasive gus. the always-lovely amy adams takes another step on her road to stardom as wilson's long suffering assistant, and ned beatty, om puri, emily blunt, christopher denham, and ken stott flesh out the supporting cast.<br /><br />charlie wilson's war is an intelligent and fun movie, a wonderful bit of a-bit-more-than-light entertainment. the fact that it decides not to be more than that shouldn't be held against it; it's brilliant at what it does.<br /><br />8/10
