ever since `midnight cowboy' i have been on the lookout for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. ever since `kramer vs kramer' i have been on the lookout for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed. she gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in `sophie's decision' and i lapped her up in `out of africa'. that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for `kramer vs kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society.<br /><br />on divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time, though the kids seem to suffer most
