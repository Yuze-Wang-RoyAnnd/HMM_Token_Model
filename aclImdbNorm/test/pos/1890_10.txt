shot entirely on location in bulgaria, the man with the screaming brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly-american types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy. <br /><br />william cole and his wife jackie arrive in bulgaria on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler yegor. things start to go awry when tatoya, the maid, murders yegor and william and a mad scientist implants a piece of yegor's brain in william's head. robots eventually become involved, as do gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, bruce campbell riding a pink vespa with prissy little streamers, and all-of-me-style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body.<br /><br />the man with the screaming brain is an incredibly funny film. it has the most hilarious tracking shot i have ever seen (when bruce campbell's character, fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) and a falling-down-the-steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing. the whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and i would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, bruce campbell, or b-movies in general.
