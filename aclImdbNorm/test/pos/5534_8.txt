strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover fbi agent (matthew modine) flirting with a mobster's concerned widow (michelle pfeffier) to tie two murders on a elusive mob boss (dean stockwell).<br /><br />the movie shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be funny and director jonathan demme ("the silence of the lambs", "philadelphia") keeps the movie from looking like it being was restrained. that's good and it avoids being predictiable, too.
