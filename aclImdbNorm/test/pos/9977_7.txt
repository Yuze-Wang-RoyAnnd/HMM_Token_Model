when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video. i finally got around and rented it. i thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show "even stevens". when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. it started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that. all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it. the cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot.
