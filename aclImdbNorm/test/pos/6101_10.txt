***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** wow, what a predicament joanna has found herself in. after accidentally running over a young child, she goes to call for help, only to return to the crime scene amidst a group of very angry onlookers. understanda- bly, this is too much for her to handle, and she flees the scene. luckily the child didn't die, but is seriously injured and in a coma. so starts the biggest struggle in joanna's life: should she keep quiet or speak up? at first she doesn't, but eventually she realises that it's torture living with such a horrible secret.<br /><br />at one point she even joins a search party to help find the culprit. and gradually a detective starts to question this woman's behavior. she wants to tell the truth, and she never meant to run away from the crime scene, but is it worth telling and having the whole town hate you for it?<br /><br />the thing about this movie is that you don't choose sides. joanna is very much a good role model, even though she's made some wrong choices. you feel for her, even though you know what she did was wrong. her journey is a good representation of what any human being would go through if something like this were to happen to them.<br /><br />margaret colin is an absolutely brilliant actress. she was amazing in the tv series now and again and great in films like independence day and the devil's own. her performance here is so realistic and unforced that she carries us singlehandedly through the entire film. in the end, i wanted to see more of her. lisa vidal also provided some good supporting work as the gentle, resourceful detective.<br /><br />to wrap it up, if you wanna see a movie that will make you think long afterwards, one that will say "this is reality", then you won't want to miss this one.<br /><br />my rating: 9/10
