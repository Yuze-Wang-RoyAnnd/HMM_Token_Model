this movie has everything! it has a good storyline, good acting, great scenery, adventure and some brilliant gags! chris farley plays tommy callaghanhe mega successful company 'callaghan auto parts' has to go on the road to stop the company going under after big tom dies. the trouble is that tommy knows nothing about break pads and needs the help of callaghan auto parts worker richard (david spade). from the moment the two dorks hit the road, the movie is just so much fun. if you love slapstick with a great storyline you'll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud! it was so sad about farley's untimely death in 1997, but a credit to his genius is 'tommy boy'. get it, chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!
