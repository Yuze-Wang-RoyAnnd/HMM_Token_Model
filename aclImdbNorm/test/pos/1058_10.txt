i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! barbara stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. enter a handsome gi, (played by the talented dennis morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy. his simple wish is to stay at the homey inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals. she now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation...add to this that her fianc'e is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn't help. the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun. throw in the character-actor nicknamed "cuddles" (who fits this name completely) it becomes even more adorable. this has become my must-see movie that i snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each christmas season. a wonderful, enjoyable movie to enjoy at christmastime or anytime!
