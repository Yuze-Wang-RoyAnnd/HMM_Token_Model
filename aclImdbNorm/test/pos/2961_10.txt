back when in the states, i was like about 7 or 8, i always woke early, just to watch this, together with a whole bunch of other cartoons like hootkloot, the road runner show, the pink panther. but this was perhaps one of the most memorable and funny animated works out there, and i still find it very funny today, i'll never forget the episodes, like the one where two aardvarks were fighting over the can of chocolate ant pudding? or the one where the aardvark is trying to reach the island where all the ants are at, and my personal favorite, the one where the ant, the aardvark and a dog end up in an animal hospital, which would later be the basis of a similar looney toon cartoon with sylvester, tweety and the bulldog. this is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there in which anyone would love to revisit, i would. an excellent series.
