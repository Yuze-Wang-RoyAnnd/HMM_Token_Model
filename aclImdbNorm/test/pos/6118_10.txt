i loved this thing. the most wonderful thing about pink flamingos is that it strives desperately to be in horrible taste, but has really gained a cult following world wide. says a lot about us (us being people) doesn't it. pink flamingos succeeds because waters made the film he wanted to make. a film need not be disgusting to succeed, but it may be. when you watch this film, you see things that are disgusting, but are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. what we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. everyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist, be it in film or any other media, should watch this film.
