first i have to admit that i have had some doubts about the director. he has done some movies (with jarkovsky) about the recent "czech=east" history or more precisely about families (individuals) how did they survive some historical moments. but it was always like the chines food sour-sweet. this movie was totally different. it was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human natures. this film is an excellent piece of art (story, acting, picture, music) but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don't want to see. by the way i have saw it on a dvd (with english subtitles) but i am afraid that in the usa i wont be able to get it.
