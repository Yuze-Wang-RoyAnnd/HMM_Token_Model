mel brooks has really outdone himself on this movie. no one can deny that blazing saddles was a classic, and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film, but men in tights has become the apex of his creative genius. this movie is a definite must-see. if you enjoy this movie, i would also recommend space balls and history of the world. the same goes in reverse. if you have seen any of these movies, then men in tights should be next on your list.
