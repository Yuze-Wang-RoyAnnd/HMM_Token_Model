this is one of the funniest movies ever made. and for those of you who don't get it, it's supposed to be funny. so often comedies try to be so intentionally funny that it misses, but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being hilarious in the most subtle of ways. even "spoofs" lack the originality and natural feel of this film. it is a comedic classic that will surely be appreciated in another time when studios are fdoing this sort of thing regularly. kudos to the makers, and to a hilariously subtle cast of actors, including isaac wade, whose performances is top-notch. truly, a real break-out star performance by an true underrated stage actor. it'll be great to see this guy get his due.
