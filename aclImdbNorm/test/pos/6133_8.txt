i stumbled upon this movie by chance. i was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night. not much else on and figured i watch it for about 20 to 30 minutes until i decided to go to bed. needless to say, i stayed up and watched the complete movie. the plot was very interesting and does make you wonder if there had not been ss who did this or at least thought of doing it. i have been looking all over for this movie. i even sent and email to the production company, but the weren't sure that it would ever make it to dvd, but said there was always hope. if anyone finds this movie drop a note here where you found it, as i'd sure like to get a copy some day.
