i have seen this movie since i was a little girl, and being from new york and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories. this movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person, woman, and provider claudine attempted to be. it was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation. it was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat. diane carroll was nominated for an oscar for this role, and it was well deserved. if you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments, enjoy claudine. your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind, and understand the overall frustration.
