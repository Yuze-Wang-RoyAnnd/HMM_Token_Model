after seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film. i mean, i don't care for stupid "stoner comedies." i'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together, smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from the simpsons and some guy named "billy bob." should have been a good time, but the film's just not that funny--too bad somebody had to go and bum their high.<br /><br />unfortunately, i found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left the theaters, so i had to wait for the video. i really enjoyed it. nice locations, quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast. looking back at it, the plot twists weren't totally unexpected, but i didn't find it cumbersome because the premise was so engaging.<br /><br />so why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy? did something happen to the producer, leaving the associate producers to do the marketing by themselves?
