monster of mexico i do agree is the weakest of the modern scooby doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was. loch ness monster however, is a considerable improvement, with gorgeous animation, honestly scotland looked beautiful. the music is good, and the plot is well thought out. plus, there is some great dialogue, and the voice acting was fabulous, with casey kasem a consistent delight as shaggy, and the beautiful scottish singer sheena easten a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role. in fact, my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two members of the voice cast, with the exception of easten whose accent did sound genuine, and somehow the loch ness monster wasn't as well designed as it had potential to be. overall, a solid and enjoyable scooby doo film. 8/10 bethany cox
