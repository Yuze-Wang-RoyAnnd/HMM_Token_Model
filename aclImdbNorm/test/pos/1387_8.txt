okay, i'm just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show. i happen to think this show is awesome. (i mean when jasmin weber was still on and franzi was still alive, so addicting!). and i was surprised to learn that this was categorized as a soap, because it just doesn't carry the same look and feel as soaps in america. soaps here are absolutely horrific! at least gzsz films on location, features real music and more plausible story lines. moreover, the acting on gzsz, for the most part, is quite believable especially with josephine schmidt and felix jascheroff. (plus, soap actors are some of the hardest workers around in the business as they have the most demanding work schedules). if it's ratings are that high, it must be doing something right; soaps in america are shown in the day-time and, historically, have always had rock-bottom ratings. give gzsz a chance! trust me, it's good!
