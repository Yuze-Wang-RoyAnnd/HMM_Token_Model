i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it. in the 1970's, there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise. it's one of the best comedies of the 1970's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary's excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director. reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. while this film is hilarious and meatballs 2 is so bad that it's fun, meatballs 3 and meatballs 4 are absolutely dreadful. recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters.
