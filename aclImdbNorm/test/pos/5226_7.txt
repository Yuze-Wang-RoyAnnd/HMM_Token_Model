raoul walsh's mega-epic, stunning filmed in an early widescreen process by the great arthur edeson, can be slow and static in the early talkie manner, but this classic wagon train journey across america to the northwest is thrilling as a sheer physical production when seen on the big screen. on t.v., the lack of close-ups and distant sound reproduction may prove daunting. young john wayne scores easily in his first starring role with a natural delivery the rest of the cast can't command. amazingly, the film flopped and wayne spent most of the following decade in grade b western fodder.
