this don siegel/clint eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left by the wayside in 1971 and what a pity. a fascinating character study with some great women for squint to deal with. geraldine page was one of our supreme actresses and she's perfectly cast. young jo ann harris is a flirty minx, and elizabeth hartman (who died too young) is undeniably repressed.<br /><br />a 7 out of 10. best performance = c. eastwood. released the same year as dirty harry, this did no business, beside getting some good reviews. seek this out unless you're only into "explosion" films. very subtle and frightening, this piece will stick with you.
