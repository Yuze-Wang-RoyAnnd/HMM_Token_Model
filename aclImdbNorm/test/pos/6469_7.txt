john cassavetes is on the run from the law. he is at the bottom of the heap. he sees negro sidney poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends, forming a sort of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by jack warden.<br /><br />as someone who has worked in a warehouse myself when i was younger, i can tell you that the warehouse fights, complete with tumbling packing cases and flailing grappling hooks are as realistic as it gets. i've been in fights like these myself, although no one got killed.<br /><br />the introduction of sidney poitier's widow is a variation on shakespeare's shylock "do i not bleed?" this is an anti racist film, which, at the time, was much needed.<br /><br />all the three principle characters - warden, cassavetes and poitier - are superb, with warden the most outstanding of the three.
