easily lucio fulci's most respected film, "don't torture a duckling" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. terror befalls a small italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. was it the creepy hermit? the spastic voodoo witch? one of the hookers? the rich girl? someone else? contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - i consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards). in no aspect does this detract from the positive attributes this movie delivers. fulci proves himself fully capable of dishing out one hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with childing killing, black magic, and of course a nice full set o' knockers... though i'm particularly more fond of fulci's "lizard in a woman's skin" and "new york ripper", "don't torture a duckling" dominates the giallo genre as a moody and compelling murder mystery!
