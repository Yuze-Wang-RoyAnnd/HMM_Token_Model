the monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. however, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. last train to clarksville, daydream believer, i'm a believer, (i'm not) your stepping stone, valleri and pleasant valley sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as boyce/hart, neil diamond, goffen/king and john stewart. while they weren't great musicians or songwriters, they had a likable screen presence and plenty of appeal and some of their own stuff was actually decent. their t.v. show is dated stuff in 2007 but i still watch the show on occasion as a time capsule to life in 1966-1968; that magical and dangerous time in u.s. history.<br /><br />however, as we all know, as a portent of things to come for the likes of kelly clarkson, the monkees didn't want to be considered manufactured and just puppets for their recording company. despite their average talents, they wanted to write their own songs, produce their own albums and call the shots when it came to tours. sadly, this turned out to be a disaster; especially when peter tork's choice of jimi hendrix as an opening act was nixed due to his stealing of the show and heavy sexual suggestions in his music compared to the monkees g-rated content.<br /><br />however, the final nail in the coffin for the monkees (until 1986) was the infamous motion picture head. head was written by bob rafelson and jack nicholson while they were allegedly high on the mary-jane. the film received poor reviews and only made $16,000 in the box office. today, the film is a cult classic, ahead of its time and delivers a message of what was on the minds of the youth in 1968, the summer of anger.<br /><br />head really has no plot. basically, one to four of the monkees lurch from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason. they go from eating in a diner, to seeing davy jones getting bashed by sonny liston, to a western, to being sucked into a vacuum, to performing at a concert and so forth. the film basically offers up oblique opinions of what was wrong with american society. the monkees bash commercialism, the war in vietnam, american policy, censorship, the establishment and greed. you have to read between the lines to see what the targets of derision were.<br /><br />the monkees spend a lot of time boxed up at certain junctions of the film, symbolizing how they felt their record company saw them; as nothing but toys for them to play with when it was time to record another hit album. a scene where they are outnumbered 16-4 in the western scene could be a symbol of them against the session musicians, songwriters, record producers and whatnot who controlled their careers and the cannon they fire at them is their way of saying "begone!".<br /><br />the film is truly a psychedelic trip to behold. the flashy tie-dye colors, the hypnotic concert and belly dancing scenes and the druggy imagery is everywhere. the acting is actually very good but that's being biased as i like the monkees t.v. show. a small soundtrack features "the porpoise song" and three songs written by the monkees themselves.<br /><br />the film actually has some hilarious scenes on occasion; although maybe they weren't supposed to be. mickey dolenz beating up a coke machine that didn't give him a soda or his violent punch-ups in the boxing scene (i mean, he was a wiry guy who probably weighed no more than 135) had me laughing it up.<br /><br />all in all, this movie is an absolute must-see for any monkees fan. i think a lot of people will feel this movie is indeed "over their head" but for those obsessed with the 60's and society at the time will find it a great time capsule.
