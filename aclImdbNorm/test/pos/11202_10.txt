like all good art, this movie could mean different things to different people. to me it means that failing to open your hart to the others could rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty live. the convenience of the selfishness is like the junk food: it feels good, but eventually could make you sick.<br /><br />almost everything i see in the us is a commercial mass production of action garbage, shallow dramas, and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic movie really touched me. thank you, nuri bilge ceylan (and all the other in the cast)!<br /><br />ivan yanachkov
