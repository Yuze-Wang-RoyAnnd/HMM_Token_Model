i'm amazed that memento (which is an excellent flick) is so well-regarded in the top 250 and this one doesn't even appear!! what the hell is that?? to be honest - when this movie ended my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than memento. after the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off, i concluded that they are equal in their excellence. i am just confused about why its not in the top 50 along with memento. i'm going to venture a guess that (sadly) it's because it's in black and white or because (again sadly)that the characters all have british accents ...sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this.<br /><br />i'm telling you that if you loved memento, you will love following as well. brilliant!
