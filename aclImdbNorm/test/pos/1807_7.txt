there were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them. cage is hillarious, so is forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the hollywood limelight. i'd love to see this released on dvd with in a special version with commentaries by cage and forman. wishful thinking, i know. ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, sure thing and 16 candles and breakfast club. it will take you back to a "totally rad" time which it seemed at the time, was a lot more simple. memo to studios: time to release the dvd!
