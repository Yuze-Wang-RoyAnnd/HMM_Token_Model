for the very reason that i love movies such as "central do brasil" ("central station", 1998), i really love "chop shop". there is no sugar-coating, there is no attempt to make these people's lives over to something more palatable or pretty. what you see is what you get, and that is often gritty and at times heartbreaking. but that is exactly what makes a movie such as "chop shop" so wonderful, alongside the fact that the storyline unfolds so elegantly and subtly. for a young brother and sister, who are about as close to homelessness as one would ever want to get, working (and living) at an auto body repair shop in queens, new york is as good as it gets. is this a good or bad thing? that is the question this movie essentially poses to the viewer. this movie is really a fantastic slice-of-life piece that at times feels like a documentary instead of a drama, and that is a great thing, because it looks and feels so real. in the midst of so, so many current movies based on essentially surreal and often implausible plots, stumbling upon "chop shop" is like finding a little gem.
