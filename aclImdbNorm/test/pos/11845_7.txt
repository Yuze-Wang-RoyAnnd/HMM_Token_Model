"seeing other people" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named ed and alice (jay mohr and julianne nicholson) who are engaged and plan to be wed soon. they live together but are both having doubts about their relationship. alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past, she might just be marrying ed because she's never felt anything else. so they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship.<br /><br />the movie balances a prescient question - by focusing too much on the "what if?" aspects of life, can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained? when ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about alice - when he realizes this, it scares him.<br /><br />i hadn't heard anything about this film in advance but i enjoyed it. it's not extremely well-made and definitely has that purposefully low-budget indie feel to it - but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today.<br /><br />check it out if you get a chance.
