this film says everything there is to say about religion - i wish it were required viewing for all bigots and would-be clericals.<br /><br />the story, set in a turn-of-the-century danish villages is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and exploring the world and its many beauty. they are now old and their life and beauty spent. their quiet new help - whom they "teach" to cook - is babette (played by the lovely stephane audran who graced so many of her husband claude chabrol's films). the life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that.<br /><br />when babette wins the lottery, she requests a chance to prepare a feast - a true labour of love. the course of the feast and its chief guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love god and life.<br /><br />this is a must-see for the devotion with which babette prepares the feast and for the speech the general gives at the end. possibly the best international film of the 1980's.
