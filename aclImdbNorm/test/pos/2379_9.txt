my son adam (5 years old) is a big scooby doo fan. he like this film a lot. he particularly liked when the loch ness monster tried to attack shaggy and scooby. the vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters.<br /><br />having seen the "vampire rock" film first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting.<br /><br />few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the tv cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children. you either like this or love it. i loved scooby doo for half an hour as a kid, i am happy my son loves it, i can just about put up with it now.
