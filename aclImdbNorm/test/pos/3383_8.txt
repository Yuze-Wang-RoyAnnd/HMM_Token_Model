north and south is a miniseries from the "golden age" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. it is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although i personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.<br /><br />james read and patrick swayze deliver excellent performances--especially read, whose george hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story. the series also contains top-notch work from kirstie alley, wendy kilbourne, hal holbrook, lewis smith, genie francis, georg stanford brown and others. the costumes, filming, sets and music are all first-rate as well.<br /><br />don't take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is--a well-made, sweeping epic from a bygone era. book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but i would advise viewers to skip book 3, which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts. books 1 and 2 are classics, though, even with their soapier elements, and they are well worth watching.
