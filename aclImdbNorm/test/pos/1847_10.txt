this is one of those movies that has everything in it. i don't think i would get tired of seeing it. hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. the casting was perfect in all respects. in a sense, the song sung by engelbert humperdink "i never got to say goodbye", is the song come to life. you will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure. i'm just surprised that i had never seen it before this past weekend. i think that it's positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing. it would be nice to cuddle up with your "honey"; sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other. there is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don't know where to turn. you will know exactly how the character feels. true family expression is available all the way through. in fact, at times you'll even think you are part of that family or they a part of yours. see it!
