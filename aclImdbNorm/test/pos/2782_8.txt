a rather charming depiction of european union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. central to the story is xavier ( romain duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in france, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. he learns about life and love rapidly. duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. the rest of the cast also play well. occasionally they all lapse into english when they want to make sure they are communicating,uncertain about all their apartment mates' ability to understand french or danish or whatever the languages may be. cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers.
