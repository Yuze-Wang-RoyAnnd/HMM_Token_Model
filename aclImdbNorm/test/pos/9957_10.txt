there were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of shakespeare's "the merchant of venice," and there have been several television productions. but no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. given the nature of the play/s most memorable character, shylock the nasty jew, it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' enthusiasm. sure the main motivation for michael radford's new film is to provide al pacino with a chance to shout, bray, brood, mutter, and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at. like richard iii, the role of shylock is a scenery-chewer's dream. it is ridiculous to call shakespeare an anti-semite, since he never met a jew. jews were banned from england from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. on some level, jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. but, while shakespeare may not have been anti-semitic, his play certainly is. pacino gives shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of yiddish. unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of fozzie bear. radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of jews and then spot antonio (jeremy irons) gratuitiously spitting on shylock (pacino), who's really just standing around, minding his own business. will buy it when it comes out on dvd, for sure! sarge booker
