our america is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. this movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. it is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. generally, a good movie. it entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. should be seen by all. having lived in the u.s. all my life, i had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens. this movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. the obvious conclusion: if this is really for real, then what else is out there that we know nothing of?
