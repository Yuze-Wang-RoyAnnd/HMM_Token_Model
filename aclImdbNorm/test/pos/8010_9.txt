"step by step," is my opinion, is a pure abc hit! i can't recall every episode, but i still enjoyed it. it's hard to say which episode was my favorite. however, i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred at school. i always laugh at that. as a matter of fact, i think just about every single one of j.t. (brandon call) and cody's (sasha mitchell) lines were funny. it would have been nice if penny (patrika darbo) had stayed on the show throughout its entire run. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, i hope it never stops airing in syndication.
