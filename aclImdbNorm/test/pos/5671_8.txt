i found this film rather brilliant. initially i wanted a "when animals attack" flick along the lines of "frankenfish" or even "rogue" but was delivered a truly horrific ordeal that was not devoid of humanity. having been to the areas this was made (including the croc farm at the start of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) it added to the fear factor. those crocs really are everywhere up there, though i don't think they had the "attitude" of this beastie. yes there were some melodramatic moments but they contributed rather distract from the whole atmosphere. i genuinely cared for the characters and shuddered contemplating "what would i do?" in their boat. not knowing where your enemy lurked or the sound of the croc chowing down at night was genuinely frightening. i would argue that this flick is one of the best horrors i have seen in years (coming close to the descent). i give it four alligator handbags.
