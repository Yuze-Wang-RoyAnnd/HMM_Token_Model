this is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. the characters are well drawn, with phil the biggest loser of all time.<br /><br />adam haddrick's character is the most vicious thing i've seen on screen since alec guinness's portrayal of adolf hitler in 'hitler: the last ten days.'<br /><br />i just wish they'd all got away with it. but without giving too much away, there are some situations you just cannot lie your way out of.
