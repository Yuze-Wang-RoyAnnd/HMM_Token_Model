all the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. norman the viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill max with some insane cackling. the writing is the best. <br /><br />i was glued to the set when this would come on when i was younger. if they came out with a dvd of all the episodes they made i would be forced to buy it. this and a conan the barbarian cartoon are the ones i miss the most from childhood. i think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons. i used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the los angeles area. <br /><br />i remember the owl was always afraid, warning max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. max didn't believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble. norman was less talkative but his simplicity was funny. he would say things like "i eat monsters for breakfast" when he was battling them. and then when he was battling zombies he would say "i eat zombies for...nevermind." classic cartoon comedy and action.<br /><br />i vote that they re-air mighty max.
