let me clarify that. this is not a "good movie", but i am so glad it is out there, i am so glad i saw it, and for the role that it plays in my dvd collection, it is sublime. it is the ultimate pg-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on mars. it is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable. watching it requires so little sophistication, (in fact, thinking too hard about what's happening will get in the way of your appreciation of this work), it makes me feel like i'm 12 again. and that kind of experience is worth more than $9.99.
