this movie about a group of small town teens that decide to rob the local bank is excellent. brian (justin walker) wants to get out of his small town, much like jimmy stewart in "it's a wonderful life." however, unlike george bailey, brian is going to rob a bank to finance his dream of attending art school, even if his father is not supportive. the offer to brian is to act like a customer and distract the guard. it's a tempting offer that if offered to many, i question what they would do. anyways, brian does it. when the sheriff (james remar) and his force surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. it's a standoff with even the feds moving in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot. the sheriff must prevent this and try to end the standoff in a peaceful way. unfortunately, tensions rise, and the teens inside turn on each other. some are out of control. the paper cutter scene is gruesome and hard to watch. very intense!
