being belgian myself, i take interest in the history of congo. it has been our only colony for many years (rwanda was a belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and it is part of our country's history. nowadays it seems to be very popular to say that all that the belgians did to congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. i'm not saying that bad things didn't happen. of course they did, but back then this wasn't abnormal. do you really think the french or the brits were that much nicer in their colonies? no, they weren't. it was 'normal' at the time for our king leopold ii to use congo as a way to gain personal wealth. it was his private property (it didn't belong to the state then) and he tried to make the most out of it. of course gruesome things like hands being chopped off happened and yes to todays standards that's inadmissible, but in those days it was common practice. and it has to be said, all this didn't happen anymore during the last decades... i know several people who have lived an worked in congo for many years before the declaration of congolese independence. it's true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and i really can't imagine they ever treated them bad. for as far as i know they have always treated them with a lot of respect (however, i'm not saying all belgians did). in fact if they weren't that old now (almost all about 80 years old now) they would love to return to congo.<br /><br />the good thing about this movie is that it gives an historically accurate vision on what happened during the last years of belgian governance and the first years of congolese independence. the story isn't as black and white (perhaps not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what i mean) as i feared it would be. it doesn't say that all the belgians did was wrong and all the congolese did was good. it shows perfectly how the congolese, in their rush of getting independent from the belgians, didn't mind to accept help from the russians as well as the americans, who both had more eye for the raw materials like copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber,... and getting the congolese in their political 'camp' and weren't all that interested in their independence. it does not only give a good idea of how lumumba became more powerful, but also how mobutu played a double role. it shows the belgian reaction on some of our compatriots being violated, threatened and even murdered (my father was one of the paratroopers who were send to congo to rescue the belgians). it gives a good idea of the political problems lumumba encountered as the province katanga didn't want to be part of the congolese republic, the role that the belgians had in the murder on lumumba ... it all gets it's part in this movie.<br /><br />the story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones. this movie has been able to give a very good idea of what life in congo in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by everybody who is interested in the history of the country. but it should also be shown in history classes, especially in belgium, because it's a part of our history that should never be forgotten. i give it a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.
