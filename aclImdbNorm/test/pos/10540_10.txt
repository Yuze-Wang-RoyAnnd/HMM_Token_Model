(this review contains a huge spoiler, but i don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) i saw "pinoccio's revenge" a while ago.<br /><br />now, you might think it's just a rip-off of child's play. indeed there are similarities.<br /><br />however, chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid. it is possible that pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something. however, the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. the kid is insane, and the kid is the one killing people! everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the kid herself thinks it's the doll. but it's the kid.<br /><br />the nudity is almost a pity, because otherwise i could tell everyone to see it, because it really is an interesting horror movie.
