its a spoof, its an intelligent comedy, it has some a pathetic action and choreography (and mind it, it is intentional), good hummable songs, good performances by the entire cast, brilliant by amir, salman and paresh and over all an script which is so rare in indian cinema that too in comedy (watch david dhawan, harmesh malhotra etc). story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. they come across one such way when they find out that a rich nri is coming india to get married. rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. entire cast is perfectly cast right from deven verma till viju khote. songs are rightly placed and are funny. surprise package is salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.<br /><br />all an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch indian cinema.
