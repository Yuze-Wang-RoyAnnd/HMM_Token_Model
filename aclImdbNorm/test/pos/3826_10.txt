i viewed the original outer limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on dvd. i find the new outer limits well more than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.<br /><br />with seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) tv series. plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future.<br /><br />while most producers and directors in hollywood ignorantly view sci-fi as indistinguishable from horror and fantasy, this series returns to the origins of science fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. this series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the "shoot-em-up" video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. it has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. it is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies. hurray!<br /><br />now, if we can only get mgm to release the entire new outer limits series on dvd instead of just the six poor teaser discs and the 1st season now only available.
