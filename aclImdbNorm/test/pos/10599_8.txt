i saw this movie with hopes of a good laugh but when i watched it i didn't stop laughing for weeks, they are such bad actors and it made this movie so much funnier to watch. ( btw ryan dunn didn't eat the toy car, he shoved it up his ass) the random appearances from the skaters and vitos parts were great. gimme some grapes vito.! no valo, your grapes are at the store. i wouldn't recommend any one under 13 to watch it, frankly they wouldn't understand half of the jokes in or what they are talking about. i love vlb and after watching this movie i couldn't help but go buy it or the viva la bam series. what is the deal with this stupid comment thing? it has to be 10 lines what kind of bull-sh1t is that? i should be able to write one as long or in this case as short as i want. i'm just going to keep typing until it tells me i can actually send it. its just a waste of time, i expected to just say what i wanted, it wasn't too much but then i'm told i have to keep putting more in and then it corrects my spelling, so what if i didn't spell something right, you get what i mean still. this is ridiculously long.<br /><br />~those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't~
