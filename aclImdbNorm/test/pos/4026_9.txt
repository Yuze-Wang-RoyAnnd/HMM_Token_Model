valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a "yes", "no" or "i don't know". the way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent. an example would be the distance of both, massimo and valeria taking a coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. i could mention several sequences, however, it is better to see the movie. it is impressive to watch that not a single detail is out of control by the director. although all actions are performed in slow movements, no shouts are necessary not special effects, but only great acting and a touching well written story. i loved it.
