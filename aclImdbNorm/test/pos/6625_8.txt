oh, it's an excellent piece of work, to be sure. in fact, several of the best scenes in cinema, or at least in bergman's cinema, are to be found in this film. liv ullmann and max von sydow are as good as you would expect. do these two give bad performances? sven nykvist delivers some masterful, although unconventionally masterful, cinematography. the script is quite good, especially in individual scenes. sometimes the film lags, and the pace is uneven, though probably intentionally. <br /><br />so what's the problem? well, the film is too bleak for its own good. other bergman films are similarly bleak, but nowhere near this harsh. eventually, i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated. i was greatly affected often during the film, but, by the end, i felt uninvolved. it's a great film, but i doubt i'd ever watch it again, nor suggest it to friends. or, if i did suggest it, i'd be very sure to warn them of what's ahead. 8/10.
