before i forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. from garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. if this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the "direction" in here, because it's really good.<br /><br />to the story: sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. while brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots tweety in his cage. tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat. anyway, sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, "hello, breakfast!" tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says, "you bad old peeping tomcat!" the cat falls into the water.<br /><br />the undaunted sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's "granny" at the door with her umbrella. sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. but, "flippety gibbet," says granny, "i've dropped my glasses. i can't see a thing without 'em. heavens to betsey, where are those cheaters."<br /><br />now sylvester has the upper hand....and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like granny's glasses. sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay.<br /><br />overall, a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. as you can tell by the quotes, i love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.
