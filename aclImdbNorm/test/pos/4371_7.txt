george carlin is probably my favorite comedian. i have seen so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. he had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. his last 2 specials (life is worth losing especially and complaints and grievances) have lacked a certain spirit and content. george appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention coming out of rehab). "i said not to mention it"! anyway. life is worth losing was especially tragic as he was overweight, disgruntled, coming off of rehab (there we go again...) and extremely unfunny. if there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him off stage, george achieved it with life is worth losing. it is as if the new millennium and post 9/11 america was trampling george's spirit. the bs had become too large to manage.<br /><br />the comeback is partially successful with it's bad for ya! this special is the transmutation completed. george is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. he is in full acceptance of his age, being old and dealing with the looming prospects of death. he has accepted being a crusty old sob and is relishing in it. this is better than his previous specials, yet far from jammin' in new york. it is a little tragic. his observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more andy rooney than lenny bruce. george isn't george anymore. he is no longer criticizing us but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how dissimilar modern life is. <br /><br />this is an improvement over the previous two specials, but george does not, as of yet, recoup his old glory (if ever). he has been reduced from critical social and political stinging commentary to mostly personal peeves. when he goes political, he still has something to say. it is heavily derived (especially if you have seen any of his previous work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to his random rantings which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation. the last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer.<br /><br />for now i will worship the sun and pray to joe pesci that george can recreate himself as a cutting edge septuagenarian. it's a 50/50 chance. life seems to have become more tedious for george and his "art" is now his life. this is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials, but is far from his old self. where does he go from here? he may never recoup but maybe he can further metamorphosing/refine this new ornery old man routine. heres to hoping for 7 more words you can't say on tv or at least a windmill he can handle.
