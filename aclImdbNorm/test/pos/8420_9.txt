caught this movie on dd while flipping channels...and thank heavens, that too when it just started.. having studied in pune, this film touched off many happy memories of the city...that apart, one wonders why more movies like this aren't made...every character is so well etched-the grandpa, the kid, the doc...except for the social worker who grates a tad, the rest of the movie hardly has a flaw...a deserving entry for the oscars, even if it wasn't nominated...definitely leaves a lump in the throat...who sez u need mush to tickle ur lacrimals ? and to think that this movie needed sachin tendulkar to propagate it. inspite of being in marathi, there was hardly a moment where i wasn't able to follow the movie...the subtitles were good.. a must watch for any fan of good cinema.
