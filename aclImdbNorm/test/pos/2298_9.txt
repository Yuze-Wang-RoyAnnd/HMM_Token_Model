after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend, people judge to harshly on what the expected to see. i figure if you go into a movie open-minded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have pre-created standards you want it to reach.<br /><br />since i try not to be hypocritical i watched this movie with a very clean slate and open-mind, and was very much pleased. since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect, but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja scroll. lovely animation, deep story, and the always joyful ninja hack-n-slashing combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite animes ever made.<br /><br />i am not promising that you will enjoy it, but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />- "before speaking, be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence" - chinese proverb
