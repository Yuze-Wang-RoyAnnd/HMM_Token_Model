then again, i like rachael ray. she is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. after all, she is a television personality. i think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. the studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. some people have posted that the show sucks. i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her. if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years. i'm sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well. good luck rachael!
