i hate football!! i hate football fans! i hate cars! but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time. <br /><br />i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend, and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried, and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark. girls, this is one football film you will need to see, its hilarious!<br /><br />the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing, the guys may not be well known actors, but this is good down to earth real humour, with real people, and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen.<br /><br />well done!
