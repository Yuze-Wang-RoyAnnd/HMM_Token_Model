the cure is one of the few movies i rated 10 out of 10. i mean, everything is flawless for me in this motion picture. i saw it almost a year ago, and yet i remember many of the scenes, especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits.<br /><br />the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline, making the film perfect.<br /><br />the message is clear - friendship, and it's displayed throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />i have nothing more to say here. simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film. and of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, suiting people of any age.<br /><br />10/10, nicely done!
