wagon master (1950) dir: john ford <br /><br />production: argosy pictures / rko radio pictures <br /><br />john ford brings the stock company out into the utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. no john wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.<br /><br />this ensemble piece nominally stars ben johnson (as travis) and harry carey jr. (sandy). they're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of mormons, led by ward bond, are being shown the exit. the group is about to embark on a trek to their own settlement, but they know the odds and the harsh terrain are against them. so they hire travis and sandy as wagon masters for their trip. along the way they run into and take along a traveling medicine salesman and his two female cohorts (alan mowbray as the doctor, recalling his appearance in my darling clementine and joanne dru as his "daughter"). tension is added when the murderous clegg gang comes upon the wagon train. and there is also an atypical (for hollywood) meeting with the navajo.<br /><br />most of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals/cultures; first between travis and sandy and the mormons, between ward bond himself (he's constantly trying to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the mormons, between the wagon train and the outlaws, and finally, everyone and the navajo. there is also a classic ford scene of a rowdy dance which expresses one of his signature themes of civilization coming to the frontier.<br /><br />again, no duke here, but i've found ben johnson, especially the young, cocksure ben johnson, to have an engaging screen presence of his own. he comes with his own backstory, with that drawl and also when you see him doing all the stunt riding himself. he's great here in one of his early credited appearances. harry carey jr., although having been around for a few years by this time, is still pretty raw at times, but he's likable. ward bond is his usual marvelous, blustery self. i've found joanne dru to be a drag in whatever i see her in, but here she's mercifully unobtrusive. other familiar faces include jane darwell, francis ford and hank worden, playing 'dumb', like he will in the searchers a few years later. it's not any more amusing here.<br /><br />there is some absolutely spectacular b&w photography by frequent ford collaborator bert glennon. not only is there the typical masterclass on the landscapes and horizons, there is also some flourish in a handful of scenes with shadow and (sun)light. the soundtrack features the legendary country music group, the sons of the pioneers. can't get more cowboy than that.<br /><br />*** 1/2  out of 4
