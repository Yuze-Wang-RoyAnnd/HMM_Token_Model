the plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair. jimmy smit plays a character that could have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story. he is evil and a wife beater. it's a character as far from his nypd and la law roles as you could possibly get.<br /><br />if you've thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role, her's your present.<br /><br />but!!!!!!!! mary louis parker wears black miniskirts and little black minidresses throughout the movie.<br /><br />she has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies. this makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer.<br /><br />i'd buy the dvd for this reason only if it was available.
