this film is a fun little private eye detective story like they aren't made any more. it's all there: tom conway is the suave detective called the falcon, goldie locke (what's in a name) is his wisecracking bumbling sidekick, louisa braganza is the damsel in distress, and of course there are the damsels maid, the professor with the secret formula, the bad guy that wants the formula, and the police inspector who's after the falcon. there is a murder, and the falcon gets implicated. the scenery is night clubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, the suburbs, and beautiful cars. go watch this little gem when you see it pass by on afternoon tv!
