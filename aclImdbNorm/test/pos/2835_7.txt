this is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of "rawhide" charles marquis warren. direcxtor gordon douglas is its chief help in this regard. its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. a hard-nosed by-the- book, cavalry officer, captain richard lance, captures a leader of the indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. he insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent totucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out. this means the leader has escaped, and lance must now lead a second patrol--and he picks the men the fort can most spare, a company of problems-- to defend the advance fort that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stopping up the bottleneck pass in that sector. as lance, young gregory peck is quite strong. other in the large cast of this film which really shows life at a cavalry outpost looking like an army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types includes war bond powerful as a hard-drinking sergeant, neville brand and steve brodie as troublemakers, warner anderson and lon chaney jr. as psychological troublemakers and gig young, art baker, herbert heyes as fellow officers with nana bryant as the colonel's wife. even barbara payton as the love interest gets by in a difficult role; michael ansara is the captured war chief, and jeff corey plays the fort's scout. there are really two great scenes in this very-well-made western--the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out, and that long patrol to the doomed ft. defiant itself. once at that fort, peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has lined up for orders, he tells them each why he took them along. reading them their shortcomings one by one; they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the indian in instead of going himself-- and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage. the music by franz waxman is good, the production qualities admirable; the argument about what would happen if lance takes the war chief in happens to be true; other than this unsolvable mistake by the central character, this is is great western. it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years.
