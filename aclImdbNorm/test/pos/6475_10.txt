the true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. knute rockne led the game of football out of the "stone age" with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive formation shifts. but he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches. along the way, he brought fame and glory to a tiny, little, unknown catholic school in indiana. pat o'brien is incomparable in his role as rockne. terrific cast that includes ronald reagan who gives a great performance as notre dame's first, true superstar, george gipp.<br /><br />for football aficionados, this is the greatest football movie ever made. do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) if you got the good version, look for a brief cameo by the immortal jim thorpe as he sticks his head in the locker room telling rockne and the team they only have a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins.
