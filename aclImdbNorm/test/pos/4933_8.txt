how i spend my vacation puts closure to the television series that aired from 1990 to 1992. i've always enjoyed the series for what it is. i've never compared the series to the looney tunes of the old days. the video release was split up in four or five episodes (i can't remember as i'm writing this) for television and it's included in the episode list of the series. what's good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a major role in the story. we see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world. elmyra is with his parents in a safari, plucky and hampton crossing the country with hampton's parents, fifi is in some beach, etc. the climax is very good and at the end all tiny toon characters reunite for the start of a new year in the "looniversity", thus practically ending the good run of this tv show.
