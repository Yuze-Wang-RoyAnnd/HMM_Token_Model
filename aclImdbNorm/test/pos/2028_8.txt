warning - possible spoilers!<br /><br />'rock star' is one of the solid rock movies i have ever seen. the original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. he is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. when his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band. a dream came true? well, almost. while starting to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.<br /><br />i liked the film, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. the overall idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. acting is quite good, with mark wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics i saw him lately, and jennifer aniston in tune with the nice-girl-who-knows-a-lot-about-life role. more problematic is the ending, which is quite conventional, and may disappoint. it looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. however, in an ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! <br /><br />8/10 on my personal scale. worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. if you do not like this kind of music, you may chose to avoid this film.
