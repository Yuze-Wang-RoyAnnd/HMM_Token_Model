i saw this movie as a child and i am longing to see it again. has it survived? i discount the 1980 version entirely as being fluff. i am sure that there are many that don't feel it is necessary to preserve these films. it is so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it is gone. young people today don't realize the hallucinatory quality and the impact on one's life a film seen in early youth can have in later life. this film, "the blue lagoon" had that effect on me. how many of us have wished to find ourselves in a place removed of the fears and chaos of the modern world. this was an idyllic story of a boy and girl castaway on a tropical island. there are troubles to be sure but in the end they fall in love and the have a baby. life should be so simple and beautiful.
