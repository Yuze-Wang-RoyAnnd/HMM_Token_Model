this is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007.<br /><br />the tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly told.<br /><br />beautifully shot, and scripted - from childhood to the adulthood it never falters.<br /><br />a brilliant insight into a lost culture, and a very good way to understand farsi cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right. it is both compassionate and thrilling, uplifting and filled with immense sorrow, joyful and depressing.<br /><br />with excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its best.<br /><br />highest recommendation: a real slice of life that uplifts and informs.
