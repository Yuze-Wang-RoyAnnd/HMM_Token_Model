i just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. it was never supposed to make sense. (duh! the writers were completely wasted on frodis at the time.) it was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.<br /><br />the monkees are good actors. they wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, davy is a broadway veteran, and peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life. don't tell me they can't act, because they most definitely can.<br /><br />they can also write. sure, jack & bob get the sole credits, but in reality, they got a big helping hand on that script from the monkees, who were also in that smoke-filled room.<br /><br />(it is absolutely impossible to spoil this film) head is very highly symbolic. among the more memorable elements is the black box, which was actually based on 2 things: the monkee image that the boys were bound to, and the real black box on the screen gems lot where the band was kept between takes. there's so much more symbolism in the movie that i'll just let you watch it and figure it out.<br /><br />the music is awesome. "circle sky" is one of papa nez's best tunes ever, and "porpoise song" & "as we go along" will have you enthralled. if you'd rather be weirded out, then "ditty diego", "can you dig it?", and "long title" should be satisfactory, great songs that they are. and then there's "daddy's song", without a doubt a homage to davy's broadway days, and the editing/color scheming for that sequence is superb. (at least for '68.)<br /><br />oh, for those of you who won't watch a 'pg' film, you're missing out. especially since head was originally rated r in 1968. the rating was lowered about twenty years later!<br /><br />now where was i? ah, yes: "we were speaking of beliefs. beliefs and conditioning...."
