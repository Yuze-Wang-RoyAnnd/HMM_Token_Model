i have watched thousands of movies in my life and i believe this movie is the most "perfect" movie that has ever been made. by perfect i mean the storytelling, the plot, the acting, the staging, the camera work, etc. (this is a lay opinion; i have no background in film production.) a lot of movies have perfect scenes, such as the bartender filing a report with the police officer in the movie fargo. (indeed, that scene could play well as a short.) in the dead every scene is done to perfection, making the entire movie perfect. perhaps, john huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. hopefully, daniel webster has gotten him out of the contract!
