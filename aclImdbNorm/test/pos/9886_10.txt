i saw the premier of this movie during the 2005 phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director, jeff hare, exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the screen. the cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on "his own terms" in a very warm and humorous way. peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles. the interaction of the family, friends and outsiders with morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignity.<br /><br />although this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family, it is truly a movie about all families. the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a "force of nature" are fresh and realistic. childhood rivalries, adult successes and failures, and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay. while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide "humorous", i thought the treatment logical and timely. if you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family struggling with this issue, then you must see this movie.<br /><br />the movie was awarded "best picture" at the phoenix film festival.
