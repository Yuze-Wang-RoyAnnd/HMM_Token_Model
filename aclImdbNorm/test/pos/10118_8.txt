<br /><br />having read the unemployed critic's, review, i went to a screening of "radio" not knowing what to expect. thankfully, the unemployed critic now appears, to me anyway, a frustrated film director/movie critic. his review is callous and totally uncalled for!<br /><br />this is a movie that will make you laugh, it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause!<br /><br />to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene "...and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio, truth is...he was teaching us. he treats us all the time, like we wish we treated each other, some of the time!"<br /><br />yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings. yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr. (in an oscar worthy performance) is a little over the top at times (see the christmas day dance scene) but you know what? so what! every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country. we need to be reminded how great we can be.<br /><br />this is a solid cast. i was particularly pleased to see s. epatha merkerson, portraying radio's mother, do something outside of law and order. i always wondered, is ms. merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order. after watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor.<br /><br />also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal, debra winger in a career-resurrecting role of coach jones's wife and chris mulkey as protagonist, frank clay.<br /><br />we cannot over look ed harris's performance as coach harold jones. after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self, it is hard to truly appreciate mr. harris and his contribution to this film. as coach jones, ed delivers a quiet, rock solid performance, that of a man on a mission. coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart, is the right thing to do.<br /><br />if you see this movie, make sure you hang around for the end credits. you will be in for a treat as the real james robert 'radio' kennedy, now in his mid 50's, is shown, still leading the t.l. hanna football team on to the field every friday night.<br /><br />one final note. if you were a teen in the mid to late 70's, this movie is worth the price of admission, for the sound track alone!
