wow, just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this. while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing (i.e. accident, hospital scenes, second to last end scenes), for a first directorial effort, i give this 10 stars! i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if you're a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box, i highly, highly recommend this movie. i think the director and writer, jay floyd, should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. based on his credits, he may be another quentin tarantino.
