i found this to be an underrated, quietly compelling spaghetti western (also known as dead or alive). despite modest credentials (apart from multi-purpose co-writer/producer albert band, the only notable crew member is composer carlo rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three american stars (newcomer alex cord is an ambiguous anti-hero, while veterans arthur kennedy and robert ryan lend a mythic quality to the proceedings) as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean-up of the town, and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of mexican bandits).<br /><br />there are several tough action scenes on hand
