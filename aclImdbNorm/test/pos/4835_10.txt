i watched the premiere of "path to paradise" way back and was stunned by it, dramatic license and all. i lived in nyc (brooklyn) a few years and kept in mind. today, given the links to groups such as al-queda, hamas, and the islamic jihad, i see it as a warning not recognized by our government. for that i place the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of gov't and there is no excuse for our gov't to prevent it, period. "path to paradise" was but a dramatic view of the '93 preview, and no one cared. now, nearly 3,000 deaths later, and years behind, we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve.
