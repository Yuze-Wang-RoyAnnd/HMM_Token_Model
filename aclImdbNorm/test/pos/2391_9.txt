i found the movie very interesting. i really enjoyed the film the actors were great. it was entertainment. benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character. the ending took a wonderful twist. i would recommend you seeing it. eddie mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail. i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn. i loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol. i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time.
