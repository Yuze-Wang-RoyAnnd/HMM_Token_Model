i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low. this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year. it really struck a chord with me. i had been anticipating this film for several months and i thought to myself, there's no way it can possibly live up to the expectations i had for it...seeing as how i built it up in my head as much as i did. well needless to say, not only did it meet my expectations but it far surpassed them. jordana brewster and cameron diaz were excellent in every way. their acting superb by far. they were both in their element and completely natural for the roles. the locales were absolutely gorgeous. every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully. i found this film very touching and took it very close to heart. i would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites. at the very least, certainly i could see it again and again.<br /><br />i swear i couldn't find one fault in this film. it's hard to say that about any film. i would highly recommend this one. it's touching, it's meaningful, and it says a lot about human nature and family.<br /><br />10 out of 10. well done by all.
