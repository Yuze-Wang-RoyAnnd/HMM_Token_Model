finding this piece sandwiched between a stale prequel and a rehashed 80s machomovie on a upn affiliate's midday saturday program would be misleading. it deserves better and definitely uses its talented leads' best attributes to its maximum advantage. bracco and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre, do the streetwise, 'troubled minds' routine that they are so good at portraying. for a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster a la fuqua's "training day," dive back into the world of early '90s tv movies to find "scam"!
