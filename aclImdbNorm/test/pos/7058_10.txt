yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an "after school special", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience. but add in bill murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit.<br /><br />it does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms. when you hear the title "meatballs", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp. the sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of "a christmas story", which i also love. the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. the only movie i've seen that comes close, is "indian summer", which i like almost as much as "meatballs", and also stars matt craven. let's hope he completes the trilogy. maybe he could come back for "return of the meatballs", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic).<br /><br />"meatballs" is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). it's a wonderful little film, that always makes me smile.
