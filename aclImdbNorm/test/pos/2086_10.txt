this film was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect made it a great mystery. fay emerson,(hilda fenchurch) who was married twice to the famous musician skitch henderson and also the son of elliott roosevelt, (fdr's son) fell madly in love with zachary scott( ronnie mason/marsh). ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even mona freeman(anne fenchurch) and proposes marriage whenever he can. rosemary decamp (dr. jane silla)(famous radio and tv actress in the 30's and 40's played mostly small town mom's) warned the ladies about ronnie mason's sick mind, and the abusive childhood he had when growing up, which caused his love/hate relationship with women. fay emerson and zachary scott would have been greater stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short lived in real life. this film is beyond critizing, it is a trully great 1945 film classic for many generations to view and enjoy!
