being a 90's child, i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons.<br /><br />i don't know why; early 90's cartoons had something special; i don't know if it was the uncertainty atmosphere, a generational change, whatever. but "tiny toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.<br /><br />the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show. easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).<br /><br />the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character. every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.
