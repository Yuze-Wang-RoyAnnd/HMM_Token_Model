house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before; namely that universal's three most famous monsters; dracula, frankenstein's monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together. naturally, the film is rather messy therefore, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring. it's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did, as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes. the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr. edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism. then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees lawrence talbot, a.k.a. the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! it turns out that dracula is on the prowl for edelman's daughter, but talbot really is serious. when it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf, the wolf man throws himself into the sea...where he ends up finding frankenstein's monster.<br /><br />overall, this film isn't as good as the earlier house of frankenstein. the 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does, as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each universal monster. dracula's plot is the biggest at first, but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end. the wolf man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops, and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand, as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought, and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. the story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting, but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film. the acting is good enough, with john carradine showing his sinister side and lon chaney jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. glenn strange is given nothing to do, and onslow stevens proves the real highlight as dr edelman. overall, this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of universal horror; but as silly monster movies go, house of dracula is worth seeing.
