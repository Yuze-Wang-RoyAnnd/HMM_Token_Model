just got back from the european premiere of the gamers: dorkness rising.<br /><br />all i can say is that if you are a gamer (crpg, rpg or larp), then this movie is for you. and if you're not a gamer? well, it's still a great deal of fun.<br /><br />the acting is certainly not oscar-worthy, but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm. the humour is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (the tribute to gary gygax is especially well done, if you can spot it). the cast are very down to earth in their appearance, befitting the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobby.<br /><br />the quality of the movie's sound and vision are adequate, but again, it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the dungeons and dragons movie, written and performed by gamers for gamers.<br /><br />not afraid to use terminology specific to one system, they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie, but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner. it also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have about other gamers and deals with that quite well.<br /><br />all in all the movie is very much driven by an well-thought-out equal balance of character, plot and entertainment (the bard is amazingly good value-for-money).<br /><br />in the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard, so i have given it 2 scores.<br /><br />score (for non-rp'ers): 7/10 (a few moments could go way over your head, but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much more.)<br /><br />score (for rp'ers): 10/10 (everything fits together, in the perfect quantities, and with the perfect charm and sentiment)
