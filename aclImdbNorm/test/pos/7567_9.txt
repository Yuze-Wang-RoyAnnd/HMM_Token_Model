first of all, despite the low rating on this site, i saw something quite worthy in this film and will gladly defend it. and no, i'm not connected to the crew in any way...<br /><br />i came across the dvd of the wind by accident, and had this strong feeling that it wasn't going to be quite like the video packaging described. so i took a chance, and was pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. i'm assuming the dvd marketing and summary were the work of mti home video to hook a rental or sale (the tag line "love comes in many forms" was changed to "terror comes in many forms"). sure, smaller films' rentals and sales depend strongly on grabbing a person's attention, especially if they've never heard of the film before (a similar case happened with the film the item). that's probably what is working against this release, as horror fans read the description of an "ancient wind" carrying with it "omens of the apocalypse." it's easy to think that that is what this film is all about, and will turn some college students in the story into crazy savages that go on a killing spree. thus, at the time this review was submitted, is most likely the reason for the lower rating on imdb. i can understand people becoming upset and thinking they were fooled by that summary , seeing the apocalyptic intro but then experiencing a dark drama. i can forgive the marketing choice since i enjoyed the wind and thought it was a refreshing change of pace from major hollywood offerings, it's just that if the intended audience was given the attention, more might voice a higher rating.<br /><br />the "wind" in this film is basically just a metaphor for society, and is the story of four friends who make some bad choices and how their lives quickly turn into ones of desperate self-preservation. after going too far in 'teaching a lesson' to one of their own, a death occurs and each person tries to save his/her own standing. manipulation between them becomes the norm, and by the end we see how self preservation becomes their main motivation over good judgment. civilized to savage, basically. this is very apparent throughout by noticing that the use of a knife, branches as clubs, fists and kicking are instruments of violence instead of guns. these characters are, in a way, doing all the wrong things for the right reason just to stay on top of the situation since they've already taken things too far. while there are many implied violent images, it's interesting to see that there is an absence of cussing and nudity. <br /><br />what works in favor of the wind are the "unknown" actors. bigger stars were originally intended, but i find it works better when you have lesser known, capable actors. this way you can get into the story without sometimes thinking "oh, that's tom cruise" for instance, instead of an actual tormented person dealing with an extraordinary situation. even unusual conversations (like between mic and billy in a field, and mic confronting claire in her bedroom) hold up well and feel quite natural in the strange universe of fairview...which has cozy homes,a forest, and wide open fields. i kept thinking of the calm landscapes concealing darker secrets in the reflecting skin, which director michael mongillo mentions as an inspiration in his commentary. <br /><br />the wind manages to get messages across without being heavy-handed about it.<br /><br />sure, if you look carefully you'll see many symbols and dialogue that other directors would just pound you over the head with. i even understood the infamous "kissing scene" between claire, john, and billy within the context of the story without being surprised it happened. i am still amazed at how some people (guys, mainly) who complain about two men kissing in a scene would obviously have no problem if the scene were of two gals kissing instead. all is handled nicely here, and additional viewings will make things more clear without making you groan and say "oh man, how did i miss that...." things sink in gradually and i appreciated that. or you could listen to the dvd commentary as well for more things revealed!<br /><br />for those of us that "got" the intentions of this film, the wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) in a time when most films are made in order to just make money and be heard knocking other films out of their "box office competition" standing when mentioned on entertainment tonight or cnn.<br /><br />years later, it's always the great little discoveries like the wind that stay in my mind, not processed star-driven blockbusters.<br /><br />get past the marketing ploy from mti home video, and you just might find this an engaging story indeed. i strongly recommend it to friends that seek out unusual films like this one.
