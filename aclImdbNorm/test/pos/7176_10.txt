this is a documentary unlike any other. it has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze it all at once is nearly impossible. documentarian william greaves shows us the process of film-making from a different perspective. we see the struggles of the actors, the director, the sound crew, and everybody else trying to hang in there and make this film successful. if this was just about a movie being made it would be ordinary. what greaves does is make it more complex by having a crew film the actors, and then this will be filmed by another crew, only to have another crew film the whole thing. three cameras, each with a different goal. it has an almost dizzying affect on you but at the same time is exciting. i like the parts where the crew organizes together and discusses what is going on. even they are somewhat in the dark as to what greaves is trying to do. half see this as an experiment while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure. no matter what side you choose, you can't argue that greaves doesn't get you involved in this process.
