a letter to the guys. i tried guys, i really tried! i tried so hard not to watch this movie. i would leave the room when it was on or jump on the computer when the wife watched it. this is her second favorite movie, the godfather being first (which i love).<br /><br />i ended up catching little bits of this movie and finally after maybe a year i was actually sitting down watching it with her. i can't believe i am saying this, but i loved this movie. dalton plays a great rhett and has his cockiness down pat. whalley plays a delightful scarlett. full of fire and brimstone and nothing is going to stop her.<br /><br />my favorite scene is when she is overseas in (ireland?) and the government is going to tear down a peasant's house because they are behind in the rent. scarlett gets all mad at this and pays the entire debt, thus making a huge name for herself around this small town.<br /><br />all i'm saying guys is you might want to try this movie... especially if you are a fan of gone with the wind. it does take a little bit to get used to the new actors, but i think you will find them refreshing.
