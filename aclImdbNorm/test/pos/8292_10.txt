i've loved this movie for a long time. i hadn't seen it in a while, so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now. i loved the chipmunks cartoon when i was young, so naturally i adored 'the chipmunk adventure.'<br /><br />i honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie. it's not wildly creative, but i've always wanted to travel all over the world, and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more. the part with elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry...<br /><br />'the chipmunk adventure' will remain a favorite of mine forever, i'm sure. i guess it's because i saw it when i was so young. i don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time. (unless, of course, they have a young heart)
