i am a college student and i bought this movie at a used book store because it sounded really funny from the back description. nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest movie ever made!<br /><br />it is especially good to watch if you are an atheist, like me. because then you can see how silly these christian people are. they seem to think non-believers like to live in really disgusting, messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors. it's a laugh riot!<br /><br />my buddies and i watch it every couple of weeks so that we may be entertained beyond our wildest imaginations! see this movie now!<br /><br />let's hope rich christiano makes some more of these movies to entertain us heathens!
