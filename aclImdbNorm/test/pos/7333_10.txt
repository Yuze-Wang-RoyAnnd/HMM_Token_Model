this is one of a very few movies with terrific acting, wonderful story line and worthwhile to watch. it is about changes in life. it is about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself. it is about accepting oneself and others. it is about life challenges. it is about coming to term with reality. it is about courage. it is about love. both actresses are very true to their role. the actresses had very good chemistry between one another in the movie. this is the key of the movie that made the movie. it is rare to see an independent film like this one. one could tell the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this movie. i wish to see more movie from this producer/writer. see the movie, you will love it.
