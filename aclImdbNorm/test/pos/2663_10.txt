i write this review just after hearing of stanley kubrick's death. it's a great loss, and i write about 2001: a space odyssey, because i feel it is the consummate kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. it is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. it was probably america's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of george lucas and countless other writers and directors.<br /><br />aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. kubrick and arthur c. clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. it is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.<br /><br />although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of dr. strangelove or clockwork orange, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like paths of glory or spartacus, i still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. if anything, hal will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. it was a half-decade in the making at a time when hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the new wave of french and italian cinema. kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. he will be missed.
