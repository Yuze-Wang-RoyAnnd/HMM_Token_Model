this movie is a perfect example of barkers cinematic gifts to the horror/ monster genre. i thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and comic books (or actually, the comics may have come second, i forget). this movie was made for barker fans. it helps to have read the book beforehand, but isn't that important if you can follow a film. i saw to anyone who is on the fence about this film, read the book, then re-watch the film. you might find a new respect for the movie. i came to this movie a big fan of barker already, and having read the book prior, loved the film instantly. there are great cameos, makeup, writing, directing, etc in this film. this movie does something that most monster/ horror movies fail miserably at, show the monsters. they are there in full color, not hidden in shadows, and taking most of the screen time. unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature, this movie celebrates the grotesque, and casts them into the forefront as the good guy. two thumbs up clive. we're waiting for the thief of always :)
