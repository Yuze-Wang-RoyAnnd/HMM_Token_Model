when the movie "the cure" starts, we find out about a young man named erik (brad renfro). erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named dexter (joseph mazello). one day, erik and dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where dexter gets his first taste of butterfinger. when erik learns out that dexter has aids, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. but when the front cover of the national enquirer says a new orleans doctor has found the cure for aids, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to new orleans for the cure.<br /><br />in my opinion, "the cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. it shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. not only do i give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun aids movie. and the tragic finale with dexter's contraction of aids is enough to make me shed a tear. very well done.
