universal studios. the name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintings...er...landscapes, fog-enshrouded countrysides, full moons, howling wolves, taverns and torch wielding mobs. yet, it is quite strange looking back on those films, how little the era which produced the true classics lasted. the '30's had it's masterpieces, but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. the '40's produced more mindlessly fun matin'ee films than it did high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of the gothic horror films ended in 1945 with 'house of dracula', bumped around with the abbott & costello comedies, and was officially dead by the 50's and the coming of the atomic age.<br /><br />so it's strange that perhaps one of universal's finest gothics was made in the '50s! that alone makes the film an oddity, since costume dramas were on their way out everywhere. it may not be comparable to the all time classics like the james whale films and 'the wolfman', but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat! get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! since various social mores had changed, the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras; there's no blood, but we see characters shot and stabbed directly, and there's even a burning torch to the face!<br /><br />the film may not really be a horror film, but it sure has the atmosphere, look and feel of one! it begins in the dead of night with howling winds(and wolves) as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers, but wait! one of them is not dead, but he can't move! he's trapped, but talking silently in his own mind, unable to communicate! what is his story? now that is how you start a horror film....<br /><br />english businessman sir ronald burton(richard greene, giving one of his best performances)sets out under the alias of richard beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of one-eyed austrian count von bruno(did sacha baron cohen see this?). it seems many years ago von bruno posed as a god to the natives in africa to steal ivory, he was exposed by burton's men, and the natives disfigured him. now he is lusting for revenge.<br /><br />the film has all the clich'es, a jonathan harker-style ride to the castle, an inn full of wary villagers, death traps, and a hulking manservant(lon chaney jr.). the torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful, including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon door(which makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on), a hunting expedition involving an imported panther(!!!??)and even an alligator pit! and then there's the romeo & juliet-style fake death that leads to the film's prologue....<br /><br />the plot is clich'e and the world-view is black and white. but it's still incredibly entertaining, with director nathan juran making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new. there are several plot-holes, too. why does ronald attempt to leave the castle so early? and he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though it's obvious, but he doesn't know that when he gives up, and he seemed so sure earlier. weird.<br /><br />all of the actors are great. despite being a rude upperclassman, richard greene makes burton one of the most likable protagonists i've ever seen in a horror film. rita corday is excellent as the count's 'peasant wife' who becomes burton's love interest, she may have the stereotypical 'falling in love with just a glance' problem of all film heroines of this era, but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing, she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do, even seeing a forced attempt by burton to quiet her(and to paw at her necklace, although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue) as a rape attempt, yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia, the audience sympathizes with her. even though he fails to make von bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldly(he is a villain in a horror film after all), stephen mcnally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman. when he reveals his burnt eye, and laughs maniacally, it is truly scary. lon chaney jr. is also great as his mute henchman gargon.<br /><br />but the best performance is undeniably by boris karloff as the mysterious physician dr. meissen. he has little screen time at first, but steals every scene he is in. it is a performance that is both creepy, sad, mysterious and ultimately, heroic. as he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of bruno's henchman, spies on our hero and speaks in that famous 'you know i'm up to no good' voice only karloff could make, you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain, always skulking about. and although he does function as the main agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human frailties such as greed and fearfulness for his own life, even cold-bloodedly poisoning a man for burton's benefit before he even gets burton to agree. his plan to help our hero & heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of von bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadistic(if unbelievably flawed)death for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in corman's poe series. he may not have much screen time, but this is easily one of boris's best performances.<br /><br />while the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some, half the fun is getting there, and there's much excitement to be had. kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains. it's no masterpiece, but it's escapist fun at it's best.
