ah! when good actors take on bland material! if you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed. while the situations are very true to life, the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there. many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. much of the dialog is just plain silly.<br /><br />but! if you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, then you will love this movie! sam elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the one-note character of detective falon come alive with depth and pathos. those of you who have never seen elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film. and also, in his early fifties in this film, he looks fantastic! his bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere! esai morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as det. falon's eager beaver new police partner. he could have easily played it as a robin to elliott's batman, but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into this role. he makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say.<br /><br />paul sorvino is fun to watch! he plays the eccentric police captain. he seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it. he makes it fun for us too.<br /><br />this movie is very by-the-numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances! sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do!
