roy andersson has managed to craft something that defies nearly all conventions of what a film should be, a piece of art that is both beautiful, funny and evocative at the same time. the end result is a moving, if somewhat fractured tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms.<br /><br />this is unlikely to appeal to everyone, in fact the humour is so finely tuned that many are unlikely to get on its wavelength. the almost absurdly long takes, awkward silences and consistent medium shots will most definitely put off even the most willing of audiences. but it is within these disjointed tales and unconventional thinking that andersson shapes a world where every character seems to take centre stage in their own absurd way. each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, with the characters seemingly left alone in their own oddity its a difficult piece to watch at times, not least because like many of its scenes, it requires patience. but whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne, others will simply look on in confusion. its a film that blends understated humour with own brand of heart
