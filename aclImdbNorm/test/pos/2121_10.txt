went to the preview engagement of "grand champion" today (dallas/fort worth, austin, snyder and a couple of other texas cities). there are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is, and it's great. though the plot is a little "hokey" (also the name of the steer in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. and i enjoyed it, too. <br /><br />the film pretty well represents west texas ranch family life, although a little exaggerated. director/author barry tubb ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment. he called the film his "love letter to texas." <br /><br />joey lauren adams plays the single mom of buddy (jacob fisher) and sister 'blow' (emma roberts). watch emma roberts (julia roberts' niece); she's very good and i think she will be in more films. there are also cameo appearances from julia roberts, bruce willis, musicians george strait, charlie robison, robert earl keen, joe ely and rodeo legends larry mahan and tuff hedeman.<br /><br />if you have young children or just want to see a feel-good movie, check out "grand champion" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). y'all will enjoy it and it will make you feel good.<br /><br />i guess since i'm from west texas, i might be a little biased...nah, i'm impartial. the film is excellent!
