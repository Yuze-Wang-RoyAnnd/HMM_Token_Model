greta garbo stars in 'anna christie', a very early 1930 mgm 'talkie', the first time 'garbo talks'. 'anna christie' is a powerful movie but not for everyone. the movie is filmed like a stage play, short on sets and cinematography, long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations. eugene o'neil who wrote the play 'anna christie' is known for his dark work and garbo's character anna christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past.<br /><br />the sound quality on the dvd was mediocre. not helping matters is that george f. marion who plays anna's estranged dad, chris christofferson, is verbally hard to understand. marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen who's teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil 'devil sea'. but his dialogue is written with a very heavy swedish accent, this is true to o'neils original play. marie dressler's dialogue as marthy owens is equally hard to understand. dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunken women, a 'wharf rat'. her dialogue also is true to o'neils original play as is charles bickford as the irish seamen, matt burke who pursues anna in a troubled relationship. garbo is actually the easiest to understand.<br /><br />the films strong point is greta garbo. she delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in hollywood. here her look isn't glamorous, it's tortured. her body posture nearly doubles over in agony. she scrunches her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. garbo conveys these angst-ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery.<br /><br />this is dark subject matter and garbo brings it to life. it's not light fare, not fun, not for everyone. 'anna christie' is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination, this is one helluva ride.
