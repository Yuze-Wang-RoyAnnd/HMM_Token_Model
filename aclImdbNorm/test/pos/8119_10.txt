bedrooms and hallways is the kind of film that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details. and that drama can be great fun too! even though your own love life and your own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this movie, every one is bound to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film. and that's the great strength of bedrooms and hallways, that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting/hilarious/funny/sexy/...things too! hope you'll enjoy the film as much as i have!
