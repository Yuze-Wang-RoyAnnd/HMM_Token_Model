venice, in 1596.jews are separated from the good christians.bassanio, a young but poor venetian loves the fair portia, who is a wealthy heiress.so he approaches his friend, a merchant called antonio for three thousand ducats to travel to belmont and propose portia.all of antonio's ships and merchandise are busy at sea, so he turns to the moneylender shylock, the one of jewish faith.shylock does not like antonio, for he spat on his face.he offers antonio a three-month loan at no interest, but if he will not pay the money in that time, he will own a pound of his flesh.also, shylock's daughter jessica elopes with the christian lorenzo.the merchant of venice is based on william shakespeare's play that's believed to have written between 1596 and 1598.i read the play last summer and now i've seen the movie, made in 2004 by michael radford.i liked the play, and i don't quite agree with the accusations of it being anti-semitic.the jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, even though he's ready to cut a piece of antonio's flesh.there's a lot of depth in his character, which all comes out in his speech where he asks "if you prick us, do we not bleed?" and so forth.there is much more human in shylock's character than in one of antonio's, who spits on the good jew.al pacino is unbeatable as shylock.he gives such a strong performance.jeremy irons is also terrific as antonio.lynn collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of portia.zuleikha robinson does great job as jessica, and charlie cox as lorenzo is also very good.kris marshall plays gratiano, and he does a good job.in the role of nerissa we see heather goldenhersh.mackenzie crook plays launcelot gobbo.as in shakespeare plays usually, also this one contains most brilliant dialogue.the movie paints a fantastic portray of the era.it deals with some great issues, in a shakespearian way.
