in my personal opinion i think this is the greatest video game ever created! i first played this game at my friends house years ago, the very next day i went out and got my own. since that day close to seven years ago i have not stopped playing it. i can't help it i just can't get bored of it. i've been addicted to other games on other, much newer systems but i keep coming back for more goldeneye. every mission is amazingly fun and challenging, the multi-player mode was like none other. i hope you can be as fortunate as i was to have played four player multi-player mode because i had brothers and friends who would get together and play this game all the time.
