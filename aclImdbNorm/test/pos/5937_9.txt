i have enjoyed both of the van dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again.<br /><br />just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />dick was good when he was younger but i enjoyed him more as he got older.<br /><br />son berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps.<br /><br />together they make a great team and work well together.<br /><br />i am disappointed that i have not found another murder 101 listed anywhere.<br /><br />i have seen both of the ones that have been shown. i am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch.<br /><br />you can sure tell berry follows in his dad footsteps, they talk alike and have the same mannerisms.<br /><br />would enjoy anything they do separately.<br /><br />will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together.
