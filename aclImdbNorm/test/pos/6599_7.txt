this is a pretty good documentary. i'm not a skateboarder, i don't particularly like skateboarding or skateboard culture. but somehow for about 2 hours this movie made me interested in the subject.<br /><br />i wouldn't call it the most intriguing film of all time, but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty southern california pools, i was interested.<br /><br />i should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too. i don't sit around yearning to hear more 70s rock bands, but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.
