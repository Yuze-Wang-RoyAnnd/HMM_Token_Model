at the beginning of this film, which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning, i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didn't know if i wanted to continue watching...although it didn't really seem to me that i had much of a choice, so compelling was the situation.<br /><br />gradually, though, that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely), and i felt drawn into tessa & bobby's predicaments, and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together.<br /><br />really just a moving, powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package. i had no idea that sarah polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia, so now i love it even more.<br /><br />i definitely recommend it. ...if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime, or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it.
