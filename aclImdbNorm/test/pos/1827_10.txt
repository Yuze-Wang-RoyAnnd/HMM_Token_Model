i don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy, and maybe i will in the future after seeing return to me. the plot was simple and no secret after the publicity. you don't have to be einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. what you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the "chemistry" abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. i love this movie....and have the dvd on order!
