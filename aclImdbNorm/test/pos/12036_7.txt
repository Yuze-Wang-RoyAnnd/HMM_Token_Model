okay, when it comes to plots, this film is far from believable and also a bit silly. yet despite its many deficiencies, the film manages to work--provided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all. if you can't, then you probably won't like this film very much at all.<br /><br />in one of the oddest plots of the 1930s, robert montgomery plays a guy living near the arctic circle at a wireless station. how exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain but into this very, very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guests--even though it had been years since he'd seen anyone but eskimos.<br /><br />first, reginald owen and myrna loy arrive when their plane crashes. they are supposedly on their way to montreal--how they got that far off course is beyond belief! reginald is a stuffy and dull fellow who is really worried about montgomery, since robert hasn't seen a woman in a very long time and owen seems in constant dread that montgomery is out to steal loy for himself. as for montgomery, that's exactly what his plans are! for the longest time, you never really understand why loy is engaged to owen--since he is about as appealing as soggy bread.<br /><br />soon, loy and montgomery fall in love but this is all for naught when, out of the blue again, montgomery's old fianc'ee arrives to announce she's there to marry him!! considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him, montgomery naturally assumed the relationship was over--but the chipper and annoying fianc'ee's sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans loy and montgomery were making.<br /><br />how all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself. as for the film, that the plot is very silly and contrived--i can't defend this. but, it also is pretty funny and charming and i see this film as a kooky comedy that is just a step or two below contemporary films like bringing up baby. silly, slight but also very charming. it's worth seeing despite not being especially believable.
