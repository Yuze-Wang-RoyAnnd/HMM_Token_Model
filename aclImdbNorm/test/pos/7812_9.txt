in a minute to pray, a second to die, clay mccord (alex cord) is an unhappy outlaw with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy.<br /><br />realizing his days as an outlaw are numbered, he wants desperately (though somewhat reluctantly) to take advantage of an amnesty being granted by rough and tumble territorial governor robert ryan, (excellent performance) who badly wants mccord to renounce his ways and accept the amnesty as an example to others while in the bandit hub of escondito, outlaw mario brega plans to kill mccord to stop that from happening.<br /><br />also starring arthur kennedy, aldo sambrell and a slew of other familiar european faces, this is co-written and produced by (american) spaghetti western pioneer albert band, also responsible for the pre-leone film gunfight at red sands.<br /><br />though the solution to the main character's "epilepsy" is lifted straight out of howard hawks' el dorado, the script is solid, pretty fresh and unpretentious. this has a great balance of action and story and alex cord is great in it. he really should have been a bigger star.<br /><br />in defense of the shorter (well dubbed) english version: personally i'm past that age where the longer version is always the better version and the ending where mccord is ironically gunned down by grimy bounty hunters after his pardon, is needlessly nihilistic and completely destroys the film's message about hope and redemption.<br /><br />call me old-fashioned, but i rooted for mccord and felt he earned that happy ending!
