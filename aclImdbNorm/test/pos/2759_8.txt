this game is very good for the n64. you can skate as tony hawk, bob burnquist, steve caballero, kareem campell, eric koston, bucky lasek, rune glifberg, andrew reynolds, elissa steamer, jamie thomas, rodney mullen, chad muska, and maybe some more skaters. the game doesn't have mike v or bam margera. dang! well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. the level school ii is a great level with so much to skate. in career mode, you collect skate, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes. there's create a skater, which is pretty cool. i created a skater named butt mulligan, a black guy with an afro, and a girl board. there's park editor, some cool premade parks, free skate, and there's single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. you can watch replays, which is always cool. each skater has 2 styles: a and b. the graphics aren't that good. well, they're good for an n64 game. i wish i had a controller pack so i could save my data. overall, this game is awesome. i give it an 8/10 for n64. but with the gba version, it's just as fun as the n64 version, but kinda hard to control. i give it a 7/10 for gba. so, go out to a place that still sells n64 games and pick up a copy. there's also versions for ps1.
