this isn't far away from the trash that bollywood normally makes but there's just something really good about it.<br /><br />the title song is one of bollywoods best and is haunting throughout. this is one of the films (along with baazigar - a must see bollywood film) that made shah rukh khan and it's for this you have to check it out.<br /><br />other reviews give away the story - it is a fairly basic idea - sharukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star.<br /><br />its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to bollywood or not! 8/10
