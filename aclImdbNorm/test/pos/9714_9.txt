it seems everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say "maha go go go"....the word is macha........like "mach".....pronounced maa - ka"...<br /><br />i grew up with this series in the early 70's here in la on the late and very lamented channel 56...before that there was tetsuwan atomu (astro boy), dating from 1963 on ol' khj tv. astro boy was the first tv example of anime we got here in the states...i was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's when, by then it'd become a series of badly animated "talking heads", a phenomenon which has only gotten worse. 'nuff said.<br /><br />as for "speed racer", i really enjoyed the basics there, the pov shots, the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted to animation...that was fairly typical of most japanese anime back then...graphics graphics graphics! take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by stanley kramer's film "grand prix" (1966), especially the redone american credits....<br /><br />oh yeah, i have the original comics from which the series is based, so i know of which i speak.<br /><br />what were we doing animation-wise besides crap like johnny quest?.....th' same ol' stuff we'd been doin' since the 20's....ho-hum!<br /><br />i guess the real problem i had/have with the way anime was/is shown on american tv is the hatchet job done on the scripts, credits, etc to "sanitize" them for american audiences...i won't go into other programs as we're talking' speed here.<br /><br />look at clowns like peter fernandez as one of the culprits here, as he was 99% responsible for the re-writes of the series...not to mention the voice of speed, racer x and others...between him and the goofs at trans/lux ( think felix the cat and the mighty hercules - oy vey!) they took a slick, very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of sesame street. think "cruncher bloch", the "forthebird company", "skull duggery"...if i go on i'll puke.<br /><br />this series dates from 40-odd years ago but i, at the time, was keen enough to feel insulted by the dumbing down of this and other japanese programs...i mean it's obvious when someone's getting' killed but they either remove it or gloss it over........pleeeeeze!<br /><br />good show - originally. sadly all the more recent incarnations of the series have that crappy "made in korea" look, not to mention being nauseatingly "pc" in content. even the japanese outsource their animation now..<br /><br />try watchin' the original japanese opening on youtube sometime...it sends chills up my spine.....if only......oh well. robert
