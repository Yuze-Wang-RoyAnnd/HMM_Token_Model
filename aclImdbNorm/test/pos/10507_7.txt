i put in the dvd expecting camp perversion from the creators of society and re-animator, and was quite surprised to become involved in an authentically suspenseful tale. acting was top-notch (nice to see vosloo in a protagonist role after a long string of villains), the storyline involving, and the few twists fairly surprising. i figured i would fast forward through much of it to get to the abduction scenes, but instead watched it through, only being let down at the very end.<br /><br />maybe i'm being too lenient, but as i stated before, i wasn't expecting much more than alien sex. of course, if you are looking for some hot alien sex, you will be let down. it was mostly quick-cut exam table nonsense with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it glimpse of an interesting 'impregnator' alien.
