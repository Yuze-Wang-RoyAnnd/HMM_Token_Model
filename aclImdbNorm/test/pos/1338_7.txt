this film is the most traumatising and painful horror film i have ever seen in my life. to know that this film is based on a true story and watching jeffrey dahmer(carl crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. i admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why jeffrey dahmer was a psycotic maniac. as he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer. every person that he lured back to his apartment, he was attracted to and had feelings for, and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him. in the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what i noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him. it was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons.<br /><br />the scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart. one scene that i found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with jeffrey. when the guy left the pub, the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at jeffrey. i also found that carl crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of jeffrey dahmer. his evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real, i was shivering in my seat. his facial expressions reminded me of the way vincent d'onofrio (private pyle/leonard) in the film 'full metal jacket' looked just before he gunned-down the general in the toilet barracks.<br /><br />if your an emotional person i wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not, than go ahead and watch it.
