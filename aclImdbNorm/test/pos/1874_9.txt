now, the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films (house of the dead 2, all souls day, etc.) but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor/writer and now director, bruce campbell, you get one of the best damn made for tv independent horror films ever made! i normally hate these movies, in my previous review, house of the dead 2, i could not believe how horrible the film was! but somehow i took a liking for this film, a very good liking for this film. the violence is good and so is the black comedy in the film and i recommend you get it, a true bruce campbell masterpiece! well, since there is only a few more lines left i can say whatever i want about this movie: ijajkasif jhjdj nxd fnehsd fhncfnfvhs djkealjwsns.uhhd sishsnhf ahcnakdjh hndchjndnh jacnd hchjnnhw jhj nashdnfhcka fhnkhad sakasdadj fjkdfa
