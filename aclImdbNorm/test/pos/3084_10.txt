cary elwes have to say puts on a better performance then costner did in rhpot but anyhow.<br /><br />have to say this film it just makes me laugh so much mainly because the actors seem really into what their doing and you just sit there and thinking 'what the hell are they on' but in a very very very very good way.the random outbursts of songs were brilliant and well and the musical score used i really really liked.great casting and as said before everyone seemed so into their roles<br /><br />10/10 from me defiantly<br /><br />'because unlike some other robin hoods.i can speak with an english accent'
