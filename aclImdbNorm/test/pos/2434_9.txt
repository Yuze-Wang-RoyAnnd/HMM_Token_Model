sacchi is the best bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as sam marlowe. the music from award winning composer george duning [from here to eternity, picnic, the world of suzie wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous ambassador hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director robert day [kojak, streets of san francisco, the avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. see this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.
