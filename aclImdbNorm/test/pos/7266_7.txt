a very watchable film, and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times.<br /><br />the whole thing looks superb, from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity, to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth, the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly.<br /><br />jonny lee miller plays maclean extremely well, though the part does not exactly stretch him, and robert carlyle seems a little wasted on plunkett, miller's highwayman colleague.<br /><br />the real star of the show was undoubtedly ken stott, who plays mr chance (a kind of 1740's chief of police) with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast.<br /><br />a great film, and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of peter greenaway's films will love the look of this, although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are up.<br /><br />well worth a viewing.
