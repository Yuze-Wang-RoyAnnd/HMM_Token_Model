it looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film! but do! i expected nothing from this movie, just something to pass the time, but i was hooked from the start! two interesting premises - a bank robbery gone wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - how will these two stories collide? just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed, it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot! it has a great but unexpected ending, and you are left wanting more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
