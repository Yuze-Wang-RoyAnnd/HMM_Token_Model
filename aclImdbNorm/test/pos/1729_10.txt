okay, i grew up on who, but haven't loved a doctor since tom baker. christopher eccleston made me love who again and i'll be furious with him forever for leaving. <br /><br />the writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. i was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (i have a ringtone of a dalek screaming "exterminate" then). <br /><br />a few of the things i love about the new programme -- 1) people actually notice when rose (billie piper) disappears off the planet. some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while, and then come home like nothing has happened, no one noticed. 2) chris eccleston's doc loves rose -- romantic or not will be debated, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion. he'd destroy the world if he had to to save her, which the old show was lacking -- often a doctor wouldn't care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) they talk and think like real people -- when rose is shown something outlandish or new (such as aliens) she acts like a real person would -- gobsmacked. i never liked it when an assistant from the old show, who never saw anything alien, would just fit right in and adapt instantly. i want to see the surprise on rose's face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life. she gives that to me. <br /><br />the few things i don't like about this series: 1)nearly everything happens on earth (london or cardiff) and i was sort of hoping for a more off-world sort of show. 2) that eccleston left so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. <br /><br />but i can let those few things go -- i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to, so i don't mind if they have stuff set on earth. <br /><br />just don't take this show seriously -- it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a super-serious heavy duty show. it's pure fun, and pure british, and i can't get enough. watch it with an open mind, and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy!<br /><br />ps -- don't watch series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant, the first few episodes of series 2 were good, but don't watch it once it gets to love and monsters. utter rubbish, completely destroys the show.
