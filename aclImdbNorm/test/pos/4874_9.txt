the first movie at the fangoria festival in vegas and the most challenging. it's not a movie for everyone. a number of the films that followed used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. this picture seemed determined to do its own thing.<br /><br />tom savini showed some comic chops as the over the top villain. he dominated every scene he was in, flipping his cape about like leslie neilson playing dracula. it was great to hear his explanation after the film. he had such a good sense of humor about the role.<br /><br />i was glad i didn't have too many preconceptions going in, because the movie offered a lot of surprises. the story was funny and profane and unusual. there was a lot of love lavished on the look. most important, it had a weird edge to it. unlike many of the movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, this was a movie that used its look for a purpose.<br /><br />there were a lot of movies at the fangoria festival with bigger budgets, but none that dared to be this different.
