i agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. here are some dialogue snippets:<br /><br />raisuli (sean connery) to eden pedecaris (candice bergen): "you see the man at the well, how he draws the water? when one bucket empties, the other fills. it is so with the world. at present, you are full of power. but you're spilling it, wastefully. and islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket." <br /><br />raisuli: the english have paid very well in the past. pedecaris: well you'll not have your way with the americans. president roosevelt will have your head for this. raisuli: roosevelt. this president roosevelt--he would try and take it himself? pedecaris: he certainly would! he is a man of grit and strong moral fiber. he does not kidnap women and children! raisuli: what kind of rifle does he use? pedecaris: a winchester! raisuli: winchester. winchester. i have no knowledge of this rifle. pedecaris: you will. <br /><br />teddy roosevelt (brian keith): the american grizzly bear is a symbol of the american character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. a little blind and reckless at times, but courageous beyond all doubt. oh, and one other trait goes with all previous. newspaper reporter: and that, mr. president? teddy roosevelt: loneliness. the bear lives out his life alone. indomitable. unconquered. but always alone. he has no real allies, only enemies--but none of them are as great as he. newspaper reporter: you feel this might be an american trait? teddy roosevelt: certainly. the world would never love us. it may respect us. it may even grow to fear us. but it'll never love us. for we have too much audacity. and we're a bit blind and reckless at times, too.
