this was alright. it was one of those we gotcha but we don't have enough evidence yet storylines. in the couple handfulls of movies i've seen her in, i've never really though much of stephanie zimbalist. a professional tv actress she is but nothing really outstanding. here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profiler. her character got along well with the motley bunch of special investigation unit cops she was assigned with. there wasn't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is... but when i found out i wasn't that surprised. oh well. one more thing that was good was the los angeles locations. quite possibly if this was made today they'd use toronto or vancouver but here they really shot in downtown l.a. like that a lot (even though i semi-despise l.a.) liked the movie, too. i don't know if i'd ever watch it again but it wasn't too bad. my grade: b-
