i lack cable-vision and no longer have "directv". so being a rural resident i have to wait for dvd releases. being a lover of blondes but not blonds, i of course not only have "barb wire", but i have "stripperella: the complete first season". i've not yet found "vip" or a second season for stripperella. i have the "baywatch hawaiian wedding" dvd. i have the issues of "playboy" that pamela denise anderson posed in. i could go on. i love pamela! there is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying stripperella. but there are certain elements that i dislike, but live with, for other series depict smoking and alcohol consumption too, some times. but those are my personal peeves and i try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me. i too was taken aback by the change in animation style, but i adapted. however, the amount of female nudity decreased, and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this. but then again i adapted. one of my favorite episodes of "mork & mindy" was when they got to meet robin williams! so of course one of my favorite episodes of "striperella" is when pamela & tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin! if there really is a "season 2" i hope that i can find it, for as a completest, i need to complete my collection. i recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes. (hey! psst! "blonde" & "blondes" are the feminine form for spelling "blond"! your software should already know that!)
