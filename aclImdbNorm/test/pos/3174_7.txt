an extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted "rodeo" western. no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's west. but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what i think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the "ups and downs" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style. he and mr. coburn teamed up extremely well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. also, check out anne archer as coburn's native american love interest in the latter part of the movie. must have been one of her first roles. <br /><br />not as flashy, perhaps, as "junior bonner", but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal. thanks to the encore western channel for showing this true grit of an under-rated movie from time to time.
