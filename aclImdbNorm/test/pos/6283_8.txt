i was cast as the surfer dude in the beach scenes. almost got cast as the muscle guy, since the real muscle guy was really really late that day. pauly had my brother and i (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place) do some vj stuff in between takes live from venice since he was still doing his mtv thing. this movie is really good as well. would it have made my top 100 if i wasn't in it........?
