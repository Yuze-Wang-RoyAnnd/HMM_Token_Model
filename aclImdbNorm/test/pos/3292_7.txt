this was on odd film. i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (spoiler ahead) ironically, the main character murders a federal official. then he's a fugitive on the run. they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.<br /><br />this was on odd film. i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children.
