this is my favourite indian movie of all time. it is comic genius. salman khan is hilarious. but amir khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. karisma kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy). andaz apna apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. there is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. i especially loved the scene in which amar (amir khan) 'regains his memory'. i've seen this movie so many times i've lost count. and i'm so glad to say that this time bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as i know a.a.a it is not a replicate of a hollywood movie (thank god). overall i recommend this movie to anyone who understands hindi/ urdu and loves good comedy.<br /><br />watch it you'll love it!!!!!
