the beloved rogue is a wonderful period piece. it portrays 145th century paris in grand hollywood fashion, yet offering a bleaker side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor. and the snow. it's constantly swirling about, adding to the severity of the setting -- brilliant! the setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarfs.<br /><br />a brilliant performance is turned in by john barrymore, outdone only by the magnificent conrad veidt, who portrays a degenerate, dissolute louis xi to perfection. and yes, veidt picks his nose on purpose, pushing his portrayal to wonderfully wry limits.
