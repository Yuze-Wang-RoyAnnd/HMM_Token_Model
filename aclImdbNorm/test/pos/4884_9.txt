league of gentleman has been the most disturbing british sitcom to be on t.v and how can a funny movie be so bad rated,they just have no taste this film will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny.<br /><br />it is surprising that it has done bad but it is british the cinema do crap most of the time but this time it (in my words) a boost with comedy with a giraffe spunks over lady's, this is a top british comedy and better than dodge-ball, so by this and it won't prove you wrong as i don't really laugh through films but this film was amazing through comedy with the best characters but i was a bit disappointed of how much edward and tabb's were in there for back to typing buy this film and it won't disappoint you.
