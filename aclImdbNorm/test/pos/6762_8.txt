this is a novelty in danish film. the mood is not unlike that of blinkende lygter, also by anders thomas jensen, but with a novel touch. one difference is fewer characters, leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into. and what characters?! the two butchers are perfect. mads mikkelsen is a dominating, deranged parody and nikolaj lie kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two.
