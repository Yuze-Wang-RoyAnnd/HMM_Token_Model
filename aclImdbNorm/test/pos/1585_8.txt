after the death of all senior officers, commander craig-scott, of the laundry and morale corps, finds himself promoted to command of an intergalactic spaceship owned by starcups corporation. its chief mission is to search for inhabitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets.<br /><br />craig-scott and his second in command, chief blather, find themselves ill-prepared for command, except insofar as they are fully able to keep the crew's undies clean--which is not to diminish the importance of clean undies, especially when incompetent commanders cause those same undies to be, well, soiled on a regular basis.<br /><br />the episodes are presented as a series of short, 2-3 minutes reports by the commander to earth. the humor is a mix of wry deadpan and outrageous physical comedy. think yes minister meets red dwarf, but on a shoe-string budget. all the usual plot devices of sci-fi are here--aliens, nuclear weapons, computer malfunctions--but each is improved by the fresh lemony scent of high-grade laundry detergent.<br /><br />commander's log is definitely low-budget, but the somewhat cheesy effects and props fit the absurd premise of the show. remember those hilarious hockey helmets they wore on the old battlestar galactica? with the "jofa" brand-name still visible? okay, there's a lot of that in commander's log, but it's cute.<br /><br />commander's log ain't high-art, but that's not what it's trying to be. it's just a little bit of off-kilter fun. it does a good job of being that.
