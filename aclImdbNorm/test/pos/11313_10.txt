i really liked this movie. i watched it last night on the public broadcasting system. the part i liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past. they basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs. i think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time. it did show the fact that england, or any other country, isn't prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed. i have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so i can't really say if they are normally their parts. after the movie, they had this panel of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the u.s. it was a thought-provoking discussion!
