the summary is only for those who hate this movie, as finding the movie ok or average is acceptable. visiting this movie on imdb has made me nostalgic as i can't help myself going back in the year 1994. i was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters. it instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite. how can i say what made this movie my favourite? was it the excellent writing ( story was ok but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous) was it the superlative performances? was it the mood of the film?<br /><br />after thinking about it for so many years i say it has to be a mixture. it is one of those movies which didn't have any flaws not even its music.(the other movie coming up in my mind right now is sholay)<br /><br />ps: rajkumar santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies. only 1 comedy is not enough. i want moreeeeeeee..........
