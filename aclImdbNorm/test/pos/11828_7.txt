i don't think this cartoon was as bad as some may think. of course, i was only five at the time it came out. but, i did find it very entertaining at the time and would still give it a look today if given the opportunity. batman and robin being voiced by adam west and burt ward was a nice touch, and gave it a sense of familiarity for me as i was also watching re-runs of the campy 1960's live action show "batman" at that age. this cartoon also introduced some new twists i had forgotten all about, like "bat-mite" for instance. looking back on it, i'm sure he was likely as annoying as many think, but he didn't bother me much at the time. the best i can recall, his voice sounded like a cross between dumb donald and orko. gee, i wonder why? :) anyway, give it a look if you can and make up your own mind. you might be surprised.
