for unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didn't get well-deserved recognition and has been vastly under-appreciated by many american movie critics. so it's easy to understand that i've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie. finally i watched it and it was so beautiful, sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life i watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape. the story is focused on the friendship between two young boys erik and dexter, eleven and twelve years old, who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best (and only) friends. the beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the cure so sincere and naturally as it has never been before. there are so many beautiful, heartfelt and poignant scenes (particularly on the river), which strike the heart and can't leave any human indifferent to them. the movie also is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism, (particularly strong with erik's shoe) which also greatly increases visual impression from such beautiful work. the story, written by robert kuhn, is well written and on the contrary to overwhelming majority of modern hollywood's products practically every scene, every phrase and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and bring something important about characters and relations between them. peter horton, who as i know had no major experience in movie directing before, showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere. the cinematography is also superb with perfectly selected locations for the movie, but the most important is perfect acting, which with all above mentioned makes the cure one of the best movies ever. both brad renfro as erik and joseph mazello as dexter created wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters. only one this movie (i haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation. annabelle sciorra also give a terrific performance as dexter's mother. it's terribly sad that such talented actors didn't get wide recognition, while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries. finally it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtrack written by david grusin, and terrific mark cohn's song (one of the best songs that i've ever heard in the movies) my great escape. so all that i can say about the cure is one simple word
