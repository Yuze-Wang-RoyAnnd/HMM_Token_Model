(note: i saw i sell the dead at the glasgow international film festival on 20th january 2009.) i sell the dead is a jet black horror comedy set in late medieval times, and stars dominic monaghan (lost, lord of the rings), ron pearlman (hellboy), larry fessenden (session 9) and angus scrimm (phantasm).<br /><br />the movie opens with grave-robber willie grimes (fessenden), still indignant and unremorseful, being dragged to the guillotine and executed. his apprentice and partner-in-crime arthur blake (monaghan) is locked in the tower awaiting his turn when father duffy (perlman), a whiskey-swilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult, pays him a visit with the apparent intention of recording blake's final confession. it soon becomes apparent, however, that duffy main interest lies in the more... otherworldly side of blake's exploits. most of the plot from here is told in flashback form as monaghan regails duffy with tales of his macabre career.<br /><br />initially, grimes and blake start out as simple wise-cracking body snatchers, working in the employ of the ghoulish dr quint (scrimm), a callous, corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as leverage over our two anti-heroes, and takes a rather unhealthy relish in his work. the pair have their first run-in with the undead when, one evening, quint sends them on a mission to a bleak moonlit moor to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously interred at a crossroads, apparently according to some ancient custom. but there's something different about this corpse. this one has been wrapped in cloves of garlic... and buried with a stake through it's heart...<br /><br />following a terrifying encounter, not only do they devise a plan to rid themselves of the scheming doctor's machinations, but they also uncover a secretive subculture of occultists who will pay good money for corpses, and even better money for living specimens of the undead. this leads our intrepid duo into the hidden underworld of the "ghoul hunting" trade, where they find themselves going head-to-head not only with vampires, monsters and zombies (and one other paranormal entity for which i will not spoil the surprise), but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the inbred and murderous murphy clan.<br /><br />i went into i sell the dead expecting a low-key, mildly distracting, low budget chiller. i was not prepared for the incredible imagination, giddy humour, quality acting, great dialogue, thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes i sell the dead a strong early contender for my horror film of the year.<br /><br />with the exception of a couple of rough edges, the production values are truly fantastic for such a low budget flick - it looks like it was made for about $20 million, and i was surprised when the director told the audience it was made for significantly less than half of that (although he was unwilling to give exact figures as the film was still being sold to distributors). the "look" and tone of the film is a visual comic book somewhere between tim burton and hammer horror, with smart little creepshow-esquire artwork inserts. the plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of a hidden underworld, running parallel to everyday life but which the general populace is either unable or unwilling to believe in, is one that actually makes quite good sense within the context of the film.<br /><br />the acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch. the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly grimes and blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic. angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist doctor quinn.<br /><br />conclusion - i loved it. it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie. i struggle to find anything bad to say about it. mark my words, this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.
