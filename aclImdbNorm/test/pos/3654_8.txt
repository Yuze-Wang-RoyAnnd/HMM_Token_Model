i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and indian ex-pats. the film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. the direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. while the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. the soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. if you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out hari om for inspiration. it was not disclosed in the q & a, but i imagine hollywood could take a lesson in budget film-making by learning from this director.
