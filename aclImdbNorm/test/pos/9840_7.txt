"the mayor of hell" has the feel of an early dead end kids film, but with a much harder edge and very few light spots, preceding the first appearance of the dead enders by four years. james cagney has a full screen opening credit, even though technically, the 'mayor' of the movie's title is actually portrayed by frankie darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. darro's character is jimmy smith, a young tough who's befriended by 'patsy' gargan (cagney), and is elected to the position when gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory.<br /><br />warner brothers made a lot of these types of films, attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty. this movie is quite gritty, with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping, as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school. the rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson (dudley digges).<br /><br />cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory, on the outside he's still nominally in control of a criminal racket. the film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation, the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this.<br /><br />warner brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled "crime school", featuring humphrey bogart in the cagney role, and billy halop in the frankie darro part. if you're partial to the dead end kids you'll probably like the latter film better, since it also offers familiar faces like leo gorcey, huntz hall, bobby jordan and gabriel dell. however the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too, with bogart's warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters, in 'mayor', madge evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for cagney's character.<br /><br />curiously, a lot of james cagney's early films aren't commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on turner classics, or source the film from a private collector. personally, i can't get enough of this kind of stuff, and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties.
