i agree with all aforementioned comments. this show was a delight to watch. funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. it's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. i would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on dvd. and as long as we're requesting smart series that never got a chance...how about dvd releases of maximum bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) and add to the list...middle ages or frank's place. there has to a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.
