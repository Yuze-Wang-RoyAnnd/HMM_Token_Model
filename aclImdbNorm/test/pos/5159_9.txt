this film isn't supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh.<br /><br />it isn't designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes.<br /><br />it isn't written as action adventure, but my pulse raced more than once.<br /><br />just like life, this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel. it simply is, and you react.<br /><br />if you don't find it funny or sad or moving, i suspect that says more about you than the film.<br /><br />it amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human, and embrace that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing, over and over for as long as we must.<br /><br />tomorrow is another day.
