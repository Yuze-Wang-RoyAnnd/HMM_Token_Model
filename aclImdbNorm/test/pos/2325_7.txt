this is a very underrated movie to say the least. as has been pointed out in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script but you find yourself saying "who cares?" while shooting milk (or insert beverage of your choice here) through your nose. it was indeed due to a rare mix of actors in sync. while kelsey grammar is obviously a gifted actor (reference 'frasier', this movie) the supporting actors/actress play their roles quite well. i found in interesting how they threw in the part about duane martin blowing the shot in the 'big game' for navy's basketball team; if any of you is a basketball fan you'll remember martin from 'white men can't jump' and 'above the rim' and you'll know that martin had a short stint in the nba with the knicks. nice how they threw in believable character attributes such as this. rob schneider's anal-retentive character was the perfect offset to grammar's calm demeanor. lauren holly played the gutsy-sexpot-with-a-brain well enough to make you want her to succeed. this is a movie that will make you laugh even if you've seen it many times before...the comic bits in this movie definitely last. i still find myself laughing 12 years later.<br /><br />"is that one of my chickens?" "uhhh...no. this a parrot....from the caribbean." "well don't let it fly away...that's supper." "arrrrr.....arr."
