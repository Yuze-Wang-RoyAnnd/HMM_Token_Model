spoiler alert! don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.<br /><br />i think this film had a lot beneath its shell. besides the apparent connections with "oldboy" (and park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action.<br /><br />the main actor, kang-ho song, is terrific in the r^ole of the priest sang-hyeon - coincidentally, "sang" means "blood" in some languages - who truly loved tae-ju, played by ok-bin kim. their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy spacek in "badlands", where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger.<br /><br />their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is entirely different. while moving, she is stiff, one-dimensional and taut, but paralysed, she says all through not moving, or through the wink of an eye.<br /><br />park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to stanley kubrick; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.<br /><br />the music is quite stock, using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian's monoreaction; it's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. while he does very little and loses at that, he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot. while his love-interest says and does a lot, her actions display very little thought behind it. in my humble opinion.<br /><br />all in all, a very disturbing film that is not made for action, which isn't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; it's magnificent, and repellant at the same time.
