15 park avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in kolkata. however as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships, social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia. i would say aparna sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 park avenue'. its an unending search within each of one of us...<br /><br />the powerhouse performance from shabana azmi is a treat to watch. her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene. indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way konkona sen's terrain. shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. she burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister ( who is more like a daughter to her ) and an aging mother played by veteran waheeda rehman. as for the leading actress from guide ( that's how i can recall her instantly ) there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there. ever dependable rahul bose plays another pivotal role in the film, he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection. this man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. from a musician in jhankar beats to a liberal muslim in mr. & mrs. iyer and so many others
