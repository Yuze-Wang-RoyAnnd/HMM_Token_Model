i have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter shane black ( lethal weapon/ kiss kiss bang bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. the final action sequence is one of the best i have ever seen in any film. the cast in this film crackles. genna davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a "lkg" sequel. samuel l. jackson is hilarious as her sidekick mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks. if baffles me how anyone could not like this film. it packs so many thrills and its so funny. the wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. in my mind the first matrix film and the long kiss goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90's. incidentally shane black made a fortune when he sold this script. at the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. it's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance, cause they would have witnessed renny harlins best film and genna davis like you have never seen her before. long live "the long kiss goodnight"!!
