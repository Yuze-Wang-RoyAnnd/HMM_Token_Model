i just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. it still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.<br /><br />i almost wrote bonnie hunt a letter to tell her how much i love it. david duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! minnie driver is so natural and honest. my favorite line is when duchovny says "i miss elizabeth but i ache for grace". oh man! i'm crying just thinking about it. also... bonnie hunt and jim belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect chicago area couple!! i know them i swear! i'm related to them i'm sure. <br /><br />this movie is in my three times a year rotation!!! i'd watch it once a week but i'm afraid i'd get too used to it!!! i always want to make it a special day when i watch it!!
