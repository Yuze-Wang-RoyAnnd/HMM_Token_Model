one of the few comedic twilight zones that's actually really good. we have floyd the barber from andy griffith show,the stock in trade old geezer dude from many old westerns,and lovable old frisby. it also has that cool spacecraft interior that i believe was used in the sci fi classic forbidden planet.or else the day the earth stood sill.plus the new guys in town are driving an exotic renault(i think) sports car back in the days when european automobiles were known as "foreign jobs" in the u.s.. the whole idea of harmonica as weapon is a hoot.and the fact that frisby's buddies love him despite being the fact he's a total bs artist is a heartwarming moment.
