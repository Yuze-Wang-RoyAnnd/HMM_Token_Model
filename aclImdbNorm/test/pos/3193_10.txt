this was a television show that i watched during the 1960s as a child and was captivated by it. in the many years that have passed, i have often thought about this show and how good it would be to watch it again, but being mindful that things of the past are not always as good as you remember them. this was a great show in the 1960s and has lost nothing, even now in 2007. sure there are a few odd production mistakes that you see when watching old shows, and it takes a couple of episodes to get used to the dubbed voices, but having done that, i was as captivated now as i was back in the 1960s. the samurai is played by koichi ose, who plays the role in a very humble manner. i remember during the 60s, due to the popularity of the show here in australia, he toured performing sword play etc, and was overwhelmed by the interest in the show and in him. it was great that one of my all time favourite shows still held the magic that it did during my childhood. a must see series.
