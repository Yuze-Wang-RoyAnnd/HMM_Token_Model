well to start with rajkumar santoshi is not a comedy film maker ,and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece.this film is really funny .loud in bits ,overacted in a few scenes but still the dialogues r really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun . story line in simple a billionaire's daughter come to india for marriage and two young chaps r behind her ,the story has a twist as well with a connection of a gangster .aamir playing a street smart guy amar has played his role with brilliance and salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection.raveena has done fine ,but karshima really turns irritating in some sequences .but real show stealer r paresh rawal and shakti kapoor ,they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing . overall such an enjoyable film that u can watch it any no. of times without getting bored.
