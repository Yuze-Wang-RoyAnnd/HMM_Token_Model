halloween:the curse of michael myers is probably the best sequel out of all of the halloween flicks. jamie, serial killer michael myers' niece, bears a baby who is then taken by the man in black from the conclusion of halloween 5. a kind nurse helps jamie escapes but myers quickly tracks her down and kills her. jamie's baby is found and rescued by tommy doyle, one of the kids jamie lee babysat in the original film, and myers arrives in haddonfield and begins to kill off the strode clan living in his old house. the film concludes with scenes revealing clues to michael's evil, the identity of the man in black, and a close to the whole dr. loomis/michael myers storyline. i highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece.<br /><br />halloween:the curse of michael myers is rated r for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language, and brief nudity.
