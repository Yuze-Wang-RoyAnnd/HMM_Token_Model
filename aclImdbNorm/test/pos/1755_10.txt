i have viewed this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grand-father. it is my favorite cartoon. i love the characters, the great little tunes, and the very good drawings. i totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon. i think it is a beautiful little cartoon. everyone i have shown it to simply loves it. it is too bad it opened on such a bad day (pearl harbor bombing). if it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success. i hope i can find a dvd of it because all the vhs tapes don't do it justice.<br /><br />i think if anyone shows it to their child they will come up with the same result. they will just love it.<br /><br />
