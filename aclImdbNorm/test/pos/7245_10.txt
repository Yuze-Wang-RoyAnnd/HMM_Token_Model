i have waited for ages to comment on this programme, and felt it was about time some justice was done to it. this is one of christie's darker, more sinister and engaging works, not simply someone being killed for money, this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery, intrigue, love and murder, made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor. the level of acting is utterly superb, joan hickson is sublime in the part, as always! the rest of the cast, including the likes of liz fraser, anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully, but it's my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack, the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical, the acting is as good as it gets, chilling, moving and totally brilliant.<br /><br />please let me know if you agree with my words. i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewan's version is. watch and enjoy.
