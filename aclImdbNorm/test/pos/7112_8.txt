coming at the end of the cycle of the universal monsters horror films, and before the golden age of sci-fi films, house of dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more cheesy {read:enjoyable} elements which would come to typify the sci-fi films of the coming era. lon chaney jr. plays the wolf man, and john carradine, dracula and glenn strange, the frankenstein monster.<br /><br />a mad scientist sets out to "cure" both monsters of their "sicknesses" by means of modern {read:mad} science. when the scientist's beautiful nurse-assistant is revealed to be a hunchback early in the film, the viewer is thereby alerted to the fact this film is not going to be typical universal fare; this film foreshadows the kind of sleazy exploitation we would come to take for granted in 1950's sci-fi.<br /><br />if you don't mind the slower pacing of the older films and black & white does not throw you off, this film is recommended viewing. afaik, this one is not currently available on dvd, but amc airs it occasionally, so keep a lookout, or you could always wishlist it on your tivo!
