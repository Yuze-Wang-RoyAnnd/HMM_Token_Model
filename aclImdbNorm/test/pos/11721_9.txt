great just great! the west coast got "dirty" harry callahan, the east coast got sharky. burt reynolds plays sharky in "sharky's machine" and i enjoyed every minute of it. playing a maverick narcotics cop in atlanta, ga is just what everyone wants. instead of suspension, he's sent to vice squad. like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies, the captain is always going to be the jerk. when i was a kid, i was curious what that movie meant "sharky's machine". well i knew who played sharky, i wonder what his machine was. it was his group of fellow cops. after uncovering the murder, he goes all out to find the perp. when it turns out to be a big time mob boss, sharky doesn't play around. when he gets the other prostitute into safety, sharky fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug. and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window. that was the bomb! randy crawford's "street life" really put the movie in the right mood, and the movie itself is really a great hit to me, always! rating 4 out of 5 stars.
