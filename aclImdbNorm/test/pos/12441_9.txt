this film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the british humour the germans can't understand. one-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in british cinema history (st.trinians). the story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables frank launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. it's probably the only film in which margaret rutherford meets her match, in alastair sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). joyce grenfell (bless her) and richard wattis both deserve mentions in dighton's masterpiece of english etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure.<br /><br />no rutherford/sim/grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. absolutely brilliant. why 9/10? only 83mins long.
