i enjoyed this film. the way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the film, is very good. plus, david cronenberg as philip k. decker was great! it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except for the killings of course).<br /><br />i was impressed with the creatures for this film, although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget, the mutants/creatures/monsters looked great, especially from 1990. this is definitely a unique film and not crap. it makes me want to go find a read the novella it's based off of. this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the "monsters" are the one with humanity.
