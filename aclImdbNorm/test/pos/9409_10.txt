i'd heard of the case, but hadn't really paid attention during the whole hoopla of fuhrman writing the book, skakel being arrested, etc. however, this movie did an excellent job of detailing martha, the skakel brothers, the murder, mark fuhrman's involvement and the results of his investigation. i especially liked the flashback scenes with martha talking about her last summer. the actress who played her literally glowed with life and made it even more poignant that the real martha was probably like that. it made martha seem like a real person rather than a victim. i'd definitely recommend watching this.
