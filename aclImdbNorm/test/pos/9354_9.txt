exceptional movie that handles a theme of great proportions with a very well-balanced direction. dmytrik was a very good director, at least from what i can tell from this movie and murder my sweet but he was seriously affected by the huac as other movie directors and actors. it is in a way ironic that crossfire received no oscars, because it is exquisite example of how to make a great film on low budget. everything about this movie is exceptional: a well-written script that makes use of extensive flashbacks, a great cast, superb lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actions proper. what more can you expect from a top-notch movie? might i add that noir is here used for its stylishness, and i might add financial advantages. but this proves once more that what was originally deemed a b-movie can have more impact today that most of the heavy-handed a-movies that lost their audience with the passage of time.<br /><br />this film is not a noir movie per se and this rises serious questions about what noir actually is. the style is definitely noir, in terms of sets and especially lights but the theme surpasses the recipe of the "noir genre". you can see things from the opposite perspective and claim that anti-semitism is only a pretext for the criminal investigation, the puzzle around the murder being the actual focus. this would have been the case had it not been for robert ryan in an outstanding performance. either way, the movie has a lot to offer and it is truly a pity that the director had to suffer so much iniquity for his former beliefs in a really "noir" period of america
