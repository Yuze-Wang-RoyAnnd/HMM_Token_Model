now, throw momma from the train was not a great comedy, but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh. the title may seem a little strange, but the entire movie isn't literally about that, although it is about something just as sinister.<br /><br />danny de vito basically wants to kill his overbearing mother, and fast forward a little bit, some random and funny events take place. the premise is quite funny, and the things that billy crystal and danny de vito get into were great. some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me, but this didn't make it a bad movie.<br /><br />for what it is, a wacky comedy, it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you saw it.
