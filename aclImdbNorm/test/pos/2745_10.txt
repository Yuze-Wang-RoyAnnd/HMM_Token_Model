every saturday morning at 11 a.m. i watched superstars. all the biggest events happened on this show at the time. challenge, which aired sunday mornings, was decent too, but all the big stuff happened on this show. wrestlers would do all their interviews with mean gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them. the matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see 2 mid carders square off in the main event. there were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud. these segments ranged from pipers pit, the body shop, the flower shop, the snake pit, the brother love show, the funeral parlor, and the barber shop. i don't recall any titles changing hands on this show. that usually happened at pay per views and saturday nights main event.
