arthur miller certainly knows. his stories give a clearer picture of what it means to live in the united states in the 20th century than any other writer i can think of.<br /><br />focus, based on one of his novels, is no exception.<br /><br />william h. macy and laura dern give fantastic performances here. emotionally bruising but ultimately rewarding, this movie is excellent.
