i was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan; you'll love this. i used to dislike horror movies, considered them stupid. but, anyway, it happens i make exceptions. i find something really extraordinary in this film. rarely have i ever seen a film that has scared the crap out of me but i tell you the truth this film gave me shivers down my neck. unlike most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters. i highly recommend this film and i'm glad that asylum are finally bringing out good horror movies these days <br /><br />i recommend! enjoy!
