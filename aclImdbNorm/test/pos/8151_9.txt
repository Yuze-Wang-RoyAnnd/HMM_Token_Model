i love a cute heartfelt movie with a happy ending. this movie could be considered a drama, bout two characters realizing true love, but the story's so touching and so sweet that in my mind its a romance. granted, the acting is not so great (thats y i didn't give it a 10) but they do the job, and they don't overact (thank god) plus they're cute, but the story's powerful and just plain adorable (some of u pansies will choke up)!!!!!! its a great watch for a love story, but if ur homophobic, stay away! for everyone else, i loved the movie, its soo sweet! i felt its a brokeback on a smaller scale...but with a happy ending....so enjoy!!
