definitely worth watching.<br /><br />ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. you don't need to be an opera lover to watch this film. (although, of course, if you hate opera, you're really going to have a bad time with this!)<br /><br />not surprisingly the segments range from brilliant to only fair. most of the fuss seems to be over godard's contribution -- whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment won't change your mind.<br /><br />some of the pieces have a clear narrative; others are more a montage of connected images.<br /><br />none of the pieces is more than 10 minutes or so; if you're not happy with what's on the screen, wait for the next segment, and think about how much culture you're soaking up.<br /><br />keep your eyes open for performances by buck henry, beverly d'angelo, elizabeth hurley, briget fonda, tilda swinton, and john hurt. (the buck henry segment alone is worth the price of admission).<br /><br />
