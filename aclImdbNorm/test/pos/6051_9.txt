having been a marine, i can tell you that the d.i. is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting marine corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men. jack webb is excellent as sgt.jim moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in paris island north carolina. the film centers on one recruit who doesn't seem to "get with the program." a more recent film, full metal jacket, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.
