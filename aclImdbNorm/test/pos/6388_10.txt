super original. really great movie! james franco and sienna miller really do go so well together on screen. i sure hope it comes out soon. i first saw this movie at a screening. because of my age and gender, i was asked to stay for a "talk." we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didn't seem to like it. i really loved it and i don't know why so many people didn't think it was that good. go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself! one thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it. i had not known anything when i went to the screening other than, it was called, "camile." it really is worth seeing.
