i am definitely not a gamer, but a couple people in my family and my boyfriend are. so, a little reluctantly i decided to find out what the big deal was with "fantasy stuff". i saw dorkness rising and thought it was hilarious! it's slapstick, but not disrespectful to those that enjoy role playing games. also, and most importantly, people who've never gamed before can enjoy it and not feel left out or lost trying to understand the plot. the acting was great and the field shots/set were believable. this makes me want to see other movies by this production company. i can't wait to see what the future holds for this group! three cheers - well done!!
