i love this film. tense with great characters. the kid from "sandlot" is excellent as is corey feldman. when the kids storm the bank, it is pure adrenaline. inside of the bank, it becomes a bit like a "lord of the flies" situation where they turn on each other. justin walker from "clueless" is wonderful. i saw this on "showtime" while channel surfing. it was a pleasant surprise. james remar is also quite good here as the small town sheriff. taylor nichols who i love from "barcelona" does a nice job too as a federal agent. i recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters. i was shocked to discover that roger corman was a producer on this, since the film is not a b movie.
