i guess i do not have too much to add. i found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out.<br /><br />the one thing that i did notice was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hook than it should have been. the use of songs is fine during the movie but the orchestral background is too busy, too contrived and if the movie was ever to be edited for dvd, i would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost inaudible level. it has cheapened the overall feel for the whole film and i can see subconsciously why a lot of people have passed it up.<br /><br />the film had a lot of levels working for it on the script, plot and comedy level. it is too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to enhance the mood. now knowing this, i find it hard to watch and i quietly curse whoever was involved with the musical editing in the film. it had all the subtlety of a jackhammer.
