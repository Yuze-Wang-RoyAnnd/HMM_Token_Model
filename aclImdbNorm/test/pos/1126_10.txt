...i cannot believe i was hooked on this show instantly, after seeing the first scene i was in it deep. <br /><br />anyway, first of all the guys are hot, cappy, evan, calvin, fischer, cappy, heath, cappy etc.<br /><br />secondly, the girls are cute, sexy, smart and are not afraid of being called bitches. i like that. which at the same time doesn't make them mean and greedy, just realistic.<br /><br />third the relationships are so great, especially casey and cappy. lately every show turns very away from it's original path and people end up with someone who wasn't even in the first season. cappy and casey's relationship is true love, a kind that lasts. they loved each other throughout the years and it didn't end when a guest star appeared. <br /><br />in todays world maybe it's kind of unbelievable for two people to love each other for a long time but it happens. and people define each other in college so i knew exactly who i wanted to be with in college. just like casey and cappy. <br /><br />i hope there are many more seasons of this show and i hope we can see the relationship between casey and cappy now that they will probably stay together, at thanksgiving... love this show
