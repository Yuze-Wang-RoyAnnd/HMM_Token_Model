bergman and comedy don't quite go together. some of his comedies are so naff you almost wince. this film has the odd naff moment - the last 30 seconds being the nadir, but on the whole this is a charming (rather than funny) piece, enjoyable throughout. bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well. there is a great scene on the train between david, marianne and an uncouth salesman which will stick in the memory. some of the marriage material is typical, cynical bergman, but this is bergman in a light rather than dark mood.<br /><br />this film has its moments and is worth the 90-odd minutes. not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for bergman.
