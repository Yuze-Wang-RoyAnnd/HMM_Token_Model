otto preminger was one of the great maverick film directors.like john huston he was a character from one of his own movies,like mr huston he was a wonderful ham who slipped in and out of performance at random but the final product of his labours was unmistakably his own. with a few exceptions films are now made by corporations,not individuals,and as a result are usually highly-polished "packages",a product in much the same way as a golf ball,a tin of dog food or a motor car is a product.the involvement of human beings in the process is almost incidental.such is the appetite for the product that there appears no end to the line of well-finished,glossy,superficially entertaining but ultimately empty films that flood the countless tv channels and movie outlets.there is no time for a man like mr preminger to stand a little apart from the torrent of "product" and craft a personal work of art. of course there has always been the "art for art's sake - money for christ's sake" ethos in film-making,but now "ars gratia artis" has,in all but name ,been consigned to history's cutting-room floor. today otto preminger would be lucky to get a job delivering pizzas in hollywood. half a century ago,having made the hugely influential,"laura","where the sidewalk ends" and "the moon is blue",he set about filming nelson algren's controversial novel "the man with the golden arm" in his eccentric and individualistic manner.rather than take his camera out onto the streets he stayed in the studio and used stylised almost expressionistic sets,quirky casting(mr frank sinatra - hot from his success in "from here to eternity",the young,inexperienced but breathtakingly beautiful miss kim novak and mr arnold stang,a man whose oddities were after his own heart)and a remarkable era - defining score by elmer bernstein featuring the cream of west coast jazzmen. an otto preminger film was always an all-round experience ,to be considered as a whole rather than breaking it down into acting,directing,photography.what appeared on the screen was preminger's vision,his creation and his interpretation of algren's novel ,not a film of algren's novel,any one of twenty competent hollywood hacks coud have produced that. from the first hi-hat cymbal beat that accompanies saul bass's iconic title sequence we are drawn into preminger's take on what is nowadays called "the life",in truth a murky area occupied by hustlers,junkies,cops,drug dealers,stone gamblers,jazz musicians,their women and hangers-on.the lines are blurred in "the life",and it's dog eats dog down there. the inhabitants circle each other like sharks,looking for a sign of weakness to be exploited.frankie machine(mr sinatra)a professional card dealer,ex-junkie and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victim.when things get tough he goes back to the needle.although he kicks the habit by going cold turkey there are absolutely no guarantees that he won't go straight back on it further down the line. mr sinatra's depiction of an addict in the throes of withdrawal has divided the critics,but the fact of the matter is that even fifty years later most of us have probably never seen such a thing in real life so we don't know how accurate the portrayal is.when i first saw the film in the late 50s i was very impressed,watching it recently on video,it seemed ,to put it unkindly,hammy.perhaps he is a victim of his own success as many actors subsequently "doing" cold turkey have,with the passing of the years,taken his performance and refined it somewhat. arnold stang is outstanding as machine's pal sparrow,a performance he exceeded only in "it's a mad,mad,mad,mad world". try and watch it on the big screen and view it as the cinematic vision of a true auteur,a giant amongst today's pygmies - otto preminger.
