an intense, dark action drama with unusually rich support from casey, keith, et. al, many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it. the film is oddly shaped -- often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in odd but well-done seemingly improved dialogues -- during the stakeouts, almost all of the "machine" get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues -- and reynolds the director deserves mucho credit for having reynolds the star step back and give them room. and unlike most action films, you really get to like the characters, which makes the 2nd half, when their various destinies good and bad unfold, unusually affecting. the combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazzy soundtrack (tarantino must be a fan -- watch this & then "jackie brown" and you'll see what i'm talking about)make this occasionally flawed film (the bad guys are a bit melodramatic) one of the better modern cop films, and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern noirs such as "body heat" & such.
