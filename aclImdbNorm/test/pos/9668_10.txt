this is a brilliant series along the same lines of simpsons. following a family as they go through life and problems etc. slightly less realistic than simpsons, talking baby and dog anyone? family guy goes where simpsons or futurama dares not, reaching past into the sicker jokes and more racy gags. and believe me, it works! almost all the gags hit the mark and they'll have you in stitches(especially the random, frequent flashbacks!) when my brother first showed me this i wasn't hooked but after a few episodes i was hooked. you will be 2. 10/10 for a truly brilliant show. congrats to seth macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)
