i was truly surprised when i first saw this movie directed by iain softley; it differs in so much ways from the usual hollywood mass-production. the plot itself is simple - kevin spacey plays a mental patient prot who claims to be from the planet k-pax who arrived to earth by a beam of light, while dr. powell played by jeff bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions... first of all, i must admit the cast is perfectly chosen: kevin spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of prot, always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not... some of the gem scenes include the one where prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with dr. powell; or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the k-pax system to the astonished astronomers... jeff bridges on the other hand is the subtle, rational side of this movie, and he delivers it perfectly. there is a whole other cast of excellent actors (like saul williams' convincing performance as ernie) who make this film truly work.<br /><br />k-pax has it all, elements of comedy; sci-fi, even psychological thriller (concerning the prot's identity) but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama. the main premise of the movie is quite intricate, but the director never lets it get loose, he always keeps it believable and yet two-ways interpretable. the camera and photography have almost a crucial part here, continuing the main idea of light travel, there is much focus on light-shadow play, lightning settings - one of the memorable scenes is where dr. powell holds a crystal figure in his office which refracts light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true? <br /><br />subtle and slow paced, intriguing and pleasurable, k-pax is truly a gem to watch, one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes, but those who see it - might fall in love with it.
