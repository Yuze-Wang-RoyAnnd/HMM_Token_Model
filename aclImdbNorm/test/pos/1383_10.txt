wow!! talk about a film that divides the audience! this is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. personally i really enjoyed it. i noticed that other reviews are comparing it to pitch black - this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is sand! people can be real stupid. no, this film is far more in common with the thing (how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music) lots of carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood. perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it's deference to other carpenter works. not least dark star which it has something in common with. i'd be interested to know how much it really cost? $8000? is that even possible? maybe it was based on a short film that cost $8000? but i did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died. they are so underplayed that it's like watching a documentary at times. having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and i'm not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them. but his gun is awesome!! give it a chance, if you like early carpenter you might fall for it, just don't expect 2001.
