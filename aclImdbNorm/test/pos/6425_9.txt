a very insightful psychological thriller! footprints is a stylish example of the 70's powerful italian film making.and luigi bazzoni, a wrongly underrated director and visually amazing 'auteur'. the movie develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints,especially in its sad and dramatic finale! florinda bolkan delivers an excellent performance,rich of nuances and touching sensitivity,being able to portray a dark lady who is not only fascinating,but also painfully real and tragically lonesome.but the all cast is a treat,as well! lila kedrova,nicoletta elmi(the mysterious kid by the beach),italian screen legend caterina boratto and stunningly beautiful b movie queen evelyn stewart in the brief but haunting role of the protagonist's friend! and klaus kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! it's peculiar to notice how incredibly well done movies like footprints were! vittorio storaro's moody and creepy cinematography,stylized locations and sets,nicola piovani's haunting score and first of all the story,so intense and disturbing,so intelligently layered and structured! a thriller with fantastic elements,but especially with a soul and a personal vision. i wish movies like footprints would not be forgotten! i wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60's/70's! and yes..i wish somebody will soon make a digitally remastered widescreen dvd out of this little masterpiece!
