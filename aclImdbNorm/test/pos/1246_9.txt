i really enjoyed this movie. yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but bruce willis learned, from the kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. this movie was a refreshing change from the trash that hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. there are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. i really believe this was one of disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. i was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos. it isn't perfect, but much better than most everything else out there.
