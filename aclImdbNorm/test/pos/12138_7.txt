pulling in 2.6 million viewers, one has to wonder what everyone's opinions on the storyline/plot is.<br /><br />reading the run down over at lifetime, i was led to believe that this would be an edge-of-your-seat thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker. sadly i was mistaken. while the main plot is interesting enough - single mother run off road one night, then is stalked by same guy, the reasoning behind the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />laura leighton plays the victim, and she does it well. whether it was all those years on melrose place or not, she does well in this movie, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm, and she's looking pretty good too these days.<br /><br />leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. i think many people will identify with the main character, after discovering why the stalker is stalking, it will be a view-only-once type of movie.
