before you watch this movie - clean your ears, take away the make-up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. she doesn't have to. this picture will give you both warmth enough to keep your relationship life-long enough. if you're jew/russian/ukrainian/immigrant - yes, what popular-movie-minority so ever - laugh within your memories. if you're something else or whatever your are anyway - laugh for the bittersweet memory of importance of friendship and family. it this movie, nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem. still, i'm afraid that few will see this movie, because it's not the type of picture people watch when they go to movies. but please, do it for the humanity, and don't forget to get the soundtrack, for pleasure.
