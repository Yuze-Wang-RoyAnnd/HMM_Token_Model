fantastic documentary. a movie within a movie. i'm so glad block forged on after his mother's death. makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. what might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? the audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. she was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. she seemed to feel trapped by the situation. i wonder if the therapist ever tried to get her to think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself? meanwhile, wife #2 was just the opposite. she was out there, working with his dad; ended her bad marriage, supported herself and appears to be a very confident, giving person. whatever the state of the marriage, the blocks did something right in raising 3 kids who could look at their parents' story, be ok with it and share it with us and maybe lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses.
