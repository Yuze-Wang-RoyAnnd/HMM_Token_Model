this video was my first introduction to the residents, and i couldn't stop playing it for the past three days. the visuals are dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than any i have ever seen on the big screen or small.<br /><br />the dvd loses points, however, for the pointless addition of new music. the original residents music is unlike anything else you've ever heard, and will really tweak your brain in the best possible way. the new music however is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is rather bad in comparison to some of the classic tracks. also, the uncompleted vileness fats video feels very incomplete, and i could only fathom the plot of the story from extensive reading of the notes on the disc.<br /><br />speaking of notes on the disc, this dvd features lots of cool easter eggs that will probably appeal to long-time fans of the residents. hint: look for icons on the notes pages that shouldn't be there.<br /><br />from a technical standpoint, the disc is one of the best dvd transfers available. there is virtually no observable pixelization, and only a little edginess in strong contrast points.<br /><br />kudos for a top notch presentation. this disc really deserves your attention.
