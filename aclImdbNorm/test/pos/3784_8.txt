charles chaplin's 'shoulder arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. with world war one just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and chaplin was no exception. and so the lovable tramp went to war! the film begins with the tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant. the tramp then finds himself in the trenches, faced with a more formidable foe, though the germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he. the uproarious moment when the tramp declares that he single-handedly captured thirteen german soldiers by "surrounding them" had me in stitches.<br /><br />there are plenty of other great moments in this film. chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface.<br /><br />however, the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. the reactions of the bumbling german soldiers, unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy, as they are single-handedly disabled one-by-one are highly amusing, especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood.<br /><br />this is a very enjoyable film, and one of the best of chaplin's pre-1920 efforts. highly recommended.
