not since j. michael straczynski's babylon 5, has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show. this is easily the best thing on tv right now! the characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their well-being. the villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they're up to next. and brian hensen's puppet work is the most innovative out there. kudos to rockne s. o'bannon for a job well done!
