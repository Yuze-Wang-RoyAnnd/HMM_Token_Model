i neglected this film when i used to go to the movie store but then the curiosity got to me and i decided to check it out. i loved it!!! the movie starts off with judy and jay heading for a halloween party at the abandoned funeral parlor hull house. then we meet a few more characters, angela and suzzanne ( the hosts), frannie, max, rodger, sal and helen. then of course they start to party and when they''re really in the mood they decide to have a s'eance which awakens a demon. the demon possesses angela and she starts her gruesome slaughtering. will they survive the night of the demons.<br /><br />the movie was overall great. the gore was fine but the nudity provided by linnea quigley (trash from rotld) once again screws it. i never was a fan of hers and never will be.
