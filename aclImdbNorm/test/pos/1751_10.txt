well, i may be bias as i grew up watching a vhs copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a dvd copy as a birthday pressie for my dad. the film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the disney store!!!). the characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of swat, the fly. and smack the mosquito), and the amazing night club scene. the musical numbers still have me humming 20 years after i first watched it. there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby-sitting, and in fact every child i know (thanks to my hoppity loving parents) have seen this film, many times. it will always get top marks for its fabulous love story, a brilliant baddy and over all originality.
