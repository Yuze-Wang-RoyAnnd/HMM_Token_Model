i'm not a sports fan - but i love sports flics! so, why ... what is a great sports flic ... this one. and the storytelling style, is very fine.<br /><br />if you are looking for a reliably fantastic 2 hours of entertainment, "greatest game" qualifies mightily. here is a movie that moves. bill paxton has gone to the same director school as ron howard - a.k.a. richie cunningham, "happy days". that is not bad. look at the immense body of fine work that ron did after moving behind the camera.<br /><br />bill like ron was a great actor, but will be a superstar director if "greatest game ever" is the indication of things to follow.<br /><br />wonderful cinematography - fantastic direction - fine acting, especially by elias koteas, shia lebeouf, marnie mcphail, josh flitter, stephen marcus, justin ashforth.<br /><br />this is a must see film not just as "feel-good", nor "sports film", this is very good cinema.
