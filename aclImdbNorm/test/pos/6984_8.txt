the influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film. the movies that come to mind immediately are alien, aliens, and starship troopers. the story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original, hibernated traveling through space, crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a "deserted" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival, while the body count mounts. this kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well. i believe that pitch black was done well. the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.<br /><br />vin diesel plays riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physically prowess, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently can see in the dark. you know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things.<br /><br />cole house plays the drug-addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to riddick, as his character reveals itself throughout the movie. it is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor. a very self-serving character that in the end gets what he deserves.<br /><br />radha mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed vessel, who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment. finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and being a leader. her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most, in that she actually grows some conviction, takes charge, and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens. she in some strange way connects with the ever-distant human side of riddick, who in turn in the end, respects her for her choices and her sticking with them.<br /><br />the story in some cases plays out as you would expect it, but i think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience. this movie is an entertaining train-wreck in progress to watch. go watch it!<br /><br />
