sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles (in this case danish) but the watching is worth it. as the story progresses, the reasoning for the choice of two sisters, to take care of their father, is questionable but their society is different. their choice leaves them alone until a french woman comes. there may be a question on why the french woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed. the feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from france is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before. it provides a fitting thank you for the kindnesses given to the guest. filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty, it is a beautiful experience for the viewer.
