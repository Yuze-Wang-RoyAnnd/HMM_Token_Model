i put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to nyc, and i couldn't believe i'd never heard of it anywhere! it has all the makings of a cult classic, starting with the characters. they are archetypal roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life, but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them (peter stormare and bai ling's performances were particularly strong). their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle, quirky humor that is (sadly) all too rare in american films these days. writer/director ramin niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past. highly recommended!
