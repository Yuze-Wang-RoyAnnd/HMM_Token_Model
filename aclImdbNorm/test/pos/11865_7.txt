if you don't have anything better to do, then go ahead and rent this movie, it's intelligent, funny it will sure have your attention busy for a while.<br /><br />i discover it by surfing channels in a boring sunday, it was on cable, and for the faces i saw, i thought it may worth the try, it made me laugh and for a movie in a sunday with nothing else on tv, it was ok. <br /><br />liv tyler looks amazing in the movie, even though her acting is not what i expected, it's kind of poor acting and for the rest of the crew, i liked reba in her role as a dr. also i found interesting seeing the guy from the sitcom "what i like about you" playing an almost gay lawyer.<br /><br />as for j. goodman i found it, as always a very good performance, michael douglas plays a small role but his characterization was hard for me to identify him..<br /><br />it's also a good movie to watch with company.
