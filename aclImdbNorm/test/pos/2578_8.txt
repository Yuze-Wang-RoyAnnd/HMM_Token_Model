in mississippi, the former blues man lazarus (samuel l. jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. he finds the town slut and nymphomaniac rae (chritina ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. when her boyfriend ronnie (justin timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of lazarus and rae, and tries to kill him.<br /><br />"black snake moan" is a weird tale of faith, hope, love and blues. the gifted christina ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives. it is amazing the versatility of this actress, and probably this is the most mature work that i have seen christina ricci perform. samuel l. jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of lazarus. the soundtrack is one of the most beautiful i have ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "entre o c'eu e o inferno" ("between the heaven and the hell")
