a rare lengthy kinski feature role as crazy johnny sex crazed outlaw who is wanted in san francisco. kinski's character is obsessed with raping women a sexual predator in the old west who has nothing more but stealing, raping, and killing on his mind. this movie maybe a major disappointment for many spaghetti western fans but not for many klaus kisnki fans. overall it had two things going for it a great performance from klaus kinski and a great music score by stelvio cipriani. <br /><br />another story line which needed much more work done to it to be impactive but still fun to watch!<br /><br />it would be nice to see this movie redone in the future. since most old movies are being re-made nowadays.
