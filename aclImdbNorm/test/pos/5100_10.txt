i first saw this in the theater in 1969 when i was 9 and immediately fell in love with it. i'm sad that sony has not seen fit to release this on dvd ("but one day, one day..."). i recently obtained a vhs copy of this on ebay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. i'm happy to report it still stands the test of time. the acting is spot-on, john williams' orchestrations are lush and leslie bricusse's songs memorable ("when i am older," "you and i," "fill the world with love," "london is london" are just a few of the standouts. and not enough can be said about peter o' toole, petula clarke, michael redgrave and michael bryant's acting. terence rattigan deserves an a+ for his update of the james hilton story. there really is nothing not to like about this film. it's a good cheer-me-up selection. glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three-cd set with lots of extras. wish sony would hurry up and do the same with the film.
