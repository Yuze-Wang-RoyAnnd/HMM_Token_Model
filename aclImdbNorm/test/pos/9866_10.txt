this review is based on the producer's cut: <br /><br />'halloween 5' was a major disappointment at the box office way back in '89. personally, i've always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection. but because of it's failure and also because of rights issues, it would be 6 years before we would see another installment. the film had the makings of being one of the best, if not the best in the series. a hardcore fan writing the script, the return of not only donald pleasence as dr. loomis and george wilbur as michael myers, but also the return of the character of tommy doyle from the first film, a major studio backing the project, and a fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making. so what went wrong? i'll give you two good reasons: re-shoots and poor editing. due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of donald pleasence, the film was changed, and not for the better. the film, like parts iii and 5, tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans. but then, thanks to the magic of bootlegging, the original cut leaked out and many fans, including my self, were very happy. i will end this portion of my review by saying this: this film is, so far at least, my favorite 'halloween' film and i'm not afraid to admit that.<br /><br />pros: the score is simply spellbinding. has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series. 'halloween 4' emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts, and 6 is the same way. great performances, especially from the late and very missed donald pleasence. moves at a breathtaking pace. an interesting explanation for michael's evil and why he won't die. some brutal kills. some pretty chilling moments, my favorite being the one involving kim darby's character. a lot of really cool nods to the previous films. some good surprises. like the previous two sequels, this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending.<br /><br />cons: though the explanation for michael's evil is fascinating, it does make him a little less scary. since when can michael move around from place to place so fast? <br /><br />final thoughts: this was the first 'halloween' that i saw in the theatre. i was so excited because i really had thought 5 would be the last and then i heard this was happening. i enjoyed it at the time, but over time i saw it for what it really was: a great movie trapped in an ok one with a terrible ending. why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings? if they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it's in right now.<br /><br />my rating: 5/5
