i really love action/adventure films and this is one of the best. of course, we love the stars of this genre, bruce willis, sly stallone, clint eastwood, kurt russell, arnold schwarzenegger and the rest, but its the story that really counts. the best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little "over the top" as in the comic book style of action. the more twists and turns, the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film; the more we action/adventure fans enjoy them. "in the line of fire" has all the elements required for a rip-roaring action thriller. it has clint eastwood as a near-retirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him. it has one of the most evil, despicable, maniacal villains in john malkovich, the type in which you can't wait to see him, "get his due". it has rene russo as the 'love interest.' it has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. it is extremely well paced by director wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the great ennio morricone. this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! don't miss it!
