as is the case with many films of this ilk, my non catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. the church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. we have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. i found myself thinking, "that's pretty cool. why did they do that?" there's this casual thing in the robert langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. i suppose it's like watching csi where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. they know the lay of the land. in this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. but if you create robert langdon, you need to set him to work. that's ok because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. i thought the film was fun. i thought the da vinci code was fun too. interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. this is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second.
