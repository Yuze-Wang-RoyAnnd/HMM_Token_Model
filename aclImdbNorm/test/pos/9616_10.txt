well as a life long fan of kung fu films i have to say this is one of the best i have ever seen. sure there is nothing special about the plot but man does it entertain. as does most movies of the genre. this film is packed with action and does not boar its viewers. it's so damn fun when i watch i have a smile on my face the whole time. this also has an impact on future films like kill bill. (many of kill bill's sound effects come from this film for example.) this is essential viewing for all knew viewers in kung fu. form open to close this film is filled with fights that really are some of the better i have seen in the genre. there are few kung fu films out there that measure up to the sheer magic and entertainment of this film. so if in search of a great kung fu movie check this one out for sure.
