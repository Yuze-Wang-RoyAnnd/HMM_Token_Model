i would not compare it to le placard, which imho had more comic moments, but romuald & juliette while being a slow starter certainly kept your attention going throughout the film, nicely paced and reaching a heart warming conclusion :) there were many marvellous comedic moments, some brilliant pathos and realistic situation acting by all actors.<br /><br />it was a typically french film, in which while confronting prejudices and phobias, which in turn the made the viewer confront his own shortcomings! i am certainly pleased to have this in my library, and will no doubt watch it time and time again, which to me is a mark of a great film.
