luis bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me. my first experience with him was the discreet charm of the bourgeosie, often considered his greatest work, with which i became so frustrated and bored that i eventually shut the tape off. likewise belle de jour, which is almost certainly his best known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces, didn't interest me very much at all. i didn't hate it like i did discreet, but i didn't like it. third, i saw l'age d'or. finally, i had gotten somewhere. fourth, los olvidados, also good. still, neither l'age d'or nor los olvidados blew me away. great films, but not masterpieces.<br /><br />nazarin is my fifth bunuel, and i like it just a tad more than those other two. it is about a priest from spain now in mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury most priests live in. he wants to be more like jesus, leading the meekest life possible. he's also willing to forgive everyone for anything, and to suffer without protest. i'm pretty sure bunuel does not sympathize with the character, and sees him as rather self-righteous. however, i only assume that because of my knowledge of the director, whose most famous quotation is "thank god, i'm still an atheist," which he apparently said in an interview over this very film (i get this information from john baxter's book about bunuel, if you're interested). the interviewer who dragged those words from bunuel's mouth must have been himself confused about nazarin. one who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction, who also knows nothing about bunuel, might see the priest as a heroic figure. this is especially true if that viewer has his/her own criticisms of organized religion. the priest may be somewhat self-righteous, but he seems to be basically a good man. when he harbors a violent prostitute in his room in order to protect her (and, presumably, to save her soul), people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual. his superiors assume the same and punish him for it. later on, he suffers even worse punishments from clerics.
