i had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival (which unlike the original 1935 production) which included extensive spoken recitatives. this had been the fashion at the time, so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition. the film should be seen if only for sammy davis jrs brilliant catlike performance as sportin' life, creeping in and out of shadows. his seduction of dorothy dadridge's bess "there's a boat dat's leavin' soon for new york," is one of many highlights. nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung. it certainly never bores which the recent pbs and met versions did. it was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie, and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven't had a chance to experience it.
