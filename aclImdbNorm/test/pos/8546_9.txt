anthony quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy. he portrays a romanian peasant with a below average iq, harassed by his wife to do more. it's wwii and the nazis have taken over his country. soon he finds himself digging entrenchments hoping to benefit himself in his wife's eyes. the nazis have different ideas. through the next years we watch events unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. his manipulations and ill luck just get him in further hot water. finally, through no fault of his own, we see his picture on the cover of "der spiegel" as the perfect aryan. the war ends and the allies put him on trial for war crimes. but all our peasant wants to do is return home to his wife.
