wrestlemania 6 took place april 1, 1990 at the skydome in toronto, ontario, canada.<br /><br />match 1: rick martel vs. koko b. ware - for what it was, a very solid opening match. koko was always fairly popular with the fans, and at this point martel was still getting over as a heel talent. in the end martel is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match.<br /><br />match 2: the colossal connection (andre the giant & haku) (c) (with bobby 'the brain' heenan) vs demolition (ax & smash) for the wwf tag team championship - at this point andre's health was really awful, so his performance was really nothing special. the crowd is 100% pro demolition in this match. in the end haku is pinned and we have new tag team champions. after the match andre lays out haku and heenan and turns face at what would turn out to be his last wrestlemania.<br /><br />match 3: earthquack vs hercules - very short match. big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. r.i.p. to both men in the match. john tenta (earthquake) passed not that long ago and same with hercules. in the end earthquake pins hercules for the win.<br /><br />match 4: mr. perfect vs brutus "the barber" beefcake - the first really good match of the night. r.i.p. to curt henning (mr. perfect). really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys. in the end brutus gets the win thanks to a lot of his major fan support during the match.<br /><br />match 5: 'rowdy' roddy piper vs bad news brown - not a technical classic, but a pretty decent brawl for wrestlemania. piper comes out half black/half white in what is considerably a classic moment. in the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner.<br /><br />match 6: the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks - complete squash match. the hart foundation gets an easy win. surprising that wwe used to have a tag team division.<br /><br />match 7: the barbarian vs tito santana - bobby heenan's "heenan family" fairs better in this match as the barbarian takes the win against tito santana. not memorable, but good to go back and watch years later.<br /><br />match 8: randy savage & sensational sherri vs dusty rhodes & sapphire - big inter-gender tag team match. dusty rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring. in the end rhodes and sapphire get the win over "the macho king" and sensational queen sherri.<br /><br />match 9: the rockers vs the orient express - surprisingly another tag team match. tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period. a young shawn michaels and his partner marty jannetty take a loss by count out in this match to the orient express.<br /><br />match 10: dino bravo vs jim duggan - duggan gets a decent reaction, despite his american patriot gimmick. bravo, a member of jimmy hart's group, comes to the ring with hart and earthquake. although he has support, duggan takes the win.<br /><br />match 11: "the million dollar man" ted dibiase (c) vs jake 'the snake' roberts for the million dollar championship - the first major main event of the night. roberts was extremely over with the fans. match was considerably good for what it was. dibiase is able to pick up a count out win on roberts. but roberts ends up possessing dibiase's money and giving it away.<br /><br />match 12: the big boss man vs akeem (with slick) - one man gang's sad attempt at being an african dream named akeem. a really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match. boss man wins with a slam.<br /><br />match 13: jimmy "superfly" snuka vs rick rude - heenan comes to the ring with rude for this match. snuka, never really got it good at wrestlemania. he always seemed to be on the losing end. after a short 5 minutes, rude gets the win over snuka.<br /><br />match 14: wwf champion hulk hogan vs intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior - dubbed as "the ultimate challenge" we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night. the match was actually very good, given that people tend to think hogan can't wrestle. a lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it. in the end warrior gets the win on hogan and wins both titles. a stunned crowd looks on as hulk hogan suffers his first loss at wrestlemania.
