nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry. never boring, always thinking positively, good with animals. okay, as one reviewer wrote, a bit too much peroxide, lipstick, and eyebrows (only madonna could get away with that). but that's why i love nikki finn, she's not your ordinary girl. she makes things happen, always exciting to be around, and always honest. sure, she steals, but she doesn't rob or murder (unless you're out to do her in). she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed. she knows what to take and what can't be stolen. if you need a favor from her, she's in 100%. bottom line: she knows how to enjoy life. nikki is always loving (which is why she has a way with wild animals), and completely dedicated to those she loves, and who love her.<br /><br />who's that girl? she's the girl for me.
