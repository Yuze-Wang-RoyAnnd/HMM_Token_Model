it gives the ordinary guy/girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars.<br /><br />for the majority of the time, they sound like the singer they are meant to be portraying.<br /><br />another twist to it - a team of make up people and costumers dress the contestant up like that singer. they might not look like them but the likelihood of getting someone that sounds like a person looking exactly the same as them are very slim.<br /><br />it's a load of fun for your saturday night - and the contestants aren't raging wannabes like they are on another tv singing show. the fact that there are no prizes involved and it is for fun means that it will attract a different type of person.<br /><br />the only gripe i have is with the kids version - it looks like they have done the round of stage schools- what happened to the normal kids?
