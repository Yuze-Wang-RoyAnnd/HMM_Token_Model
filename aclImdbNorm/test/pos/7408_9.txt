it is characteristic that this film is not better known. it obviously lacks most elements that a successful theater film needs: heroes, villains, conflict and resolution, romantic love interest.. <br /><br />everything is topsy-turvy here, nothing works out as it should, everyone is clumsy, sad, angry, hurt and hungry and nobody has a solution for anything. in short: it is war and it is hell for everybody involved. people try to do best, but interests, allegiances and so called duty interfere. the picture transports us back in time to the civil war with an intensity seldom seen in today's cinema. straightforward honest images of an intense beauty. the actors are very well cast for the story and they make the characters come truly alive in front of our eyes. <br /><br />a silver dollar in a heap of nickels!
