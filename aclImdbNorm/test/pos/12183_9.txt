***may contain spoilers*** ok, it wasn't exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than i had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie.<br /><br />i usually don't care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly (i mean duh he's a rock star) but anyway i loved stuart townsend in this, and aaliyah, although she had a small part in the movie was amazing.<br /><br />and even though tom cruise played lestat in the interview with a vampire, i have to admit that i am glad he turned down the role even though i normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff.<br /><br />overall, the movie was great and i enjoyed watching it, even if there were parts that could have been better. great vampire movie.
