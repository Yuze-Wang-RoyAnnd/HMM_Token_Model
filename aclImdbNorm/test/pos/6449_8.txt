when i first saw the ad for this, i was like 'oh here we go. he's done high school musical, but he can't coast along on that so now he's making appearances on other disney shows'. personally, i love the suite life and i'm a big fan of ashely tisdale. but for some reason, i'm not too keen on zac efron, although all my friends think he's the best thing since jesse mccartney. but he really annoys me. anyway, i watched the show (taking a break from english coursework) and was pleasantly surprised. the performances were good all round, especially from the regular characters on the suite life, and zac efron wasn't as bad as i had anticipated. all in all, a pretty good show.
