i thought i might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. on the contrary, i was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. in 1969, the transition among african-american groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. it took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. special mention should be made of arnold johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery. i'd rather watch this than "to sir with love" any old day!
