ocean's 12<br /><br />'if you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (alan rickman as hans gruber, die hard)<br /><br />this adage certainly rings true in this sequel. terry benedict has been informed that danny ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants it all back. the ocean gang need a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as benedict has made it impossible for them. so it's off to europe to perform acts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid catherine zeta jones' super cop, an old flame from rusty's (pitt's) past. <br /><br />on their first heist in amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'night fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. he issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of uma thurman-kill bill ii-buried-alive-type-sequence. interesting? well, yes. slow? sort of. entertaining? mostly. unnecessary scenes of character development? plenty. <br /><br />ocean and his band of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. too many. damon's linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; bernie mac talks too much and don cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as ever (i really like cheadle, but could not abide this). pitt and clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. however, what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was. and as much as these actors work well together, zeta jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight 11 sided hole. she simply doesn't fit and her chemistry with pitt is non-existent.<br /><br />the stars of this film for me, however, were vincent cassel as the night fox and soderbergh's choice of locations. cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born into both. his night fox is arrogant, 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (danny ocean) and a total contrast to the ocean gang. this is where i think the film loses its way. cassel and the european locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the american actors and the style of the first film. we want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. this is where the film doesn't work.<br /><br />admittingly, you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going to far left or right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this.
