this film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in burma. when i first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life. i knew very little about aung san suu kyi or her democracy movement. it effected me so i wanted to understand more about the situation. any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. patricia arquette is superb as the american lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict. it is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity. as the film itself says the 1988 massacre of pro democracy activists was not televised and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world. i implore everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the burmese people.<br /><br />it is about time this film was released on dvd. can anything be done?
