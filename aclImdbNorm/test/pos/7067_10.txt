i'm not american, but meatballs still really hits me. maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie. watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i can't really put my finger on and a place i can't quite remember.<br /><br />meatballs is just a great movie. it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible.<br /><br />if you're reading this you probably know what i mean.<br /><br />all i can say on top of what i've already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you're american.<br /><br />i guess you know what i mean by that too.
