man, i never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. while i expected some hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. this film-inside-film shows a female stabbed "victim" messing the whole set until she finally "die". her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that mute witness is not a typically horror movie.<br /><br />the main character, the mute american make-up artist billy hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina zudina. her performance is top-notch; her character can't speak, so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.and, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. her sister (fay ripley) is the girlfriend or the fianc'ee or the wife of the "in-film director" (evan richards). they were both very funny most of the time. i won't spoil more, but the scenes following the bathtub moment, with them two, the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.<br /><br />the plot get twisted near the end, possibly misleading at one particular moment. but don't worry. such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.
