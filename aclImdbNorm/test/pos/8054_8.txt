**spoilers** shocking yet true story of the horror that befell the alabama/georgia border town of phenix when it was taken over by a gang of organized hoodlums who turn it into the sin city of the south.<br /><br />with crime skyrocketing and no one to turn to a group of concerned citizens get well respected phenix lawyer albert patterson, john mcintire, to run for the office of state district attorney. with the criminal element of phenix doing everything, from intimidation to outright murder, to keep the voters form getting patterson the nomination he still wins with the other 86 counties of the state, not including phenix's russell county, giving him the nod by just over 1,000 votes.<br /><br />terrified in what patterson would do when he takes office head of the phenix mob rett tanner, edward andrews, has a hit put out on him. patterson is gunned down while driving to his office but his killers are spotted by ellie rhodes, kathryn grant, who soon becomes, through an informer in patterson's office, tanner's next person in line to be targeted for murder. what tanner & co. didn't expect is that the late albert patterson's son john, richard kiley, got the news from ellie about his dad's murder before his boys could shut her up! that major miscalculation on tanner's part will end up putting an end to both his criminal organization as well as his freedom!<br /><br />powerful documentary-style crime movie with the actual persons involved in the events given some 15 minutes, at the start of the film, to tell their stories. this despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by the tanner mob that was still at large at the time their interviews were filmed!<br /><br />finishing what his brave dad started john patterson single handedly brought the story of phenix city to the front pages of both the state and national newspapers giving tanner the very negative publicity that he tried so hard to avoid. with the now alabama national guard flooding into phenix city the blood-thirsty and gutless, in not willing to stand up to people with guns in their hands, tanner mob evaporated from sight like a morning mist after the sunlight hits it! and with john patterson now taking the place of his murdered dad as the state of alabama's new attorney general you can be sure that the patterson mob has seen its last days of pushing people around as well as murdering them. the only thing that they'll see now in the future is the gray prison walls and bars that will be their home sweet home for the rest of their rotten and miserable lives!<br /><br />very probably the most graphically violent movie to come out of hollywood up to that time "the phenix city story" didn't pull any punches in showing how a group of lawless and powerful criminals can turn a quite american city into living hell for everyone in it. no one was speared from these ruthless gangsters who didn't even think twice when it came to murdering even women and children if that's what it took to keep them in power! as for the phenix city police departmentn they had better thing to do then enforced the law that they were sworn and paid to uphold. they were out having coffee and donut's while their city was being burned to the ground by the gangsters like tanner who had them in their hip pocket!
