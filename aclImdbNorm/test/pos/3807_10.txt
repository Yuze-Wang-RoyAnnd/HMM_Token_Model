i loved this movie, i saw it when i was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, this evening i got to see it again. i really thought it had an interesting idea, they only thing that upset me was the ending which i felt was a cop out. 'round here it's hard to find this movie and i was lucky enough to have seen it on bravo. i also expected to see more drew barrymore in here too!
