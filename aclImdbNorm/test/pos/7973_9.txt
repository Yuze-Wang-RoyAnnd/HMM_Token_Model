this certainly is one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium. it's an homage to all the stars of the great tv western classics, and it is the ultimate revival of the western movie. the story of two brothers who meet after the war between the states and end up on different sides of the law isn't new but interesting nonetheless, and the shootouts and the atmosphere are great. there is some graphic violence like bad guys getting chopped to death with an axe or women being shot down in cold blood, and lee majors doesn't take part in the action until the very end, that's why i gave it 9 out of 10 points. but it still is one of the best new western productions i've ever seen. i've had the honor and pleasure to meet chris mcintyre at the festival of the west and have a nice chat with him, and i've had the chance to meet buck taylor who performs the role of town doctor. in my opinion, we ought to be much obliged to chris mcintyre for his efforts to gather that many stars of the classic tv westerns and sass around him to perform in a new western such as this. chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters, too. both are young and promising, and i think we should see more of them in future western productions. i sincerely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. i hope that chris mcintyre will continue to work on other western movies and present us with some more great productions such as this one. great work, chris! jasper p. morgan (pete)
