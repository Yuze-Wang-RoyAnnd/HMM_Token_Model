i saw this the week it opened four years ago and i really did not know what to expect being unfamiliar with sorrentino's work at the time. he has created a very intriguing and ultimately moving account of an odd character, one for whom the phrase 'life is for living' no longer applies. it outwitted me at every turn and i was constantly surprised by the story. i enjoyed the pacing very much and the way i was gradually given the pieces to work out what was happening. tony servillo is superb, as is magnani. it opens with a brilliantly stylish wide shot and concludes with a very moving image that takes the movie into sublime territory. i thought long afterwards about the main character and the position he was in and his final fate and i didn't shake it for weeks. i recently bought the film and that final scene where he thinks about his friend gets me every time. i still have yet to talk to anyone who has seen this. it's a shame that it did not reach a wider audience as if this is the direction of italian cinema it can only be a good thing.
