the best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. rudy ray moore is my personal hero. whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, i can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. when it comes to blaxploitation, rudy's the man. nobody is meaner. watch dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down mr. big and willie green. awesome plot, huh? there are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. if you say a couple of lines from dolemite, you are instantly cool. if you are in the mood for a laugh riot, rent this movie. also check out the human tornado, disco godfather, and petey wheatstraw the devil's son-in-law. now, can you dig that? <br /><br />"you no business barring, insecure, rat soup-eating, motha!!'"
