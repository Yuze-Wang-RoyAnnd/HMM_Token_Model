river's edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one. having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something. perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie. given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. very well acted and just unpleasant at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools. fantastic.
