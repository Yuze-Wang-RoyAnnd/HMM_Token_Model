tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen, not that there's much competition, but anyway...<br /><br />all in all, tromeo and juliet is definitely one of troma's better movies, one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung. it's a funny, action-packed, gory take on the world's greatest love story, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie. well, except for the ending, where tromeo and juliet kill juliet's abusive father, and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children.<br /><br />this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare's scripts. thumbs up!
