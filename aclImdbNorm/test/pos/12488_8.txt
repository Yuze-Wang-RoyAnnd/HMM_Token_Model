a nice, humorous mix of music hall (in the first third mostly) and police procedural mystery as the various suspects' stories start to collapse. the final exposure of the murder may come as a surprise if you don't watch closely. a gritty look at paris of the time. you can ignore the final scene (the hollywood ending). louis jouvet is best as the police inspector who seems to be just passing through, but is really on top of things.
