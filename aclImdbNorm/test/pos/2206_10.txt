first of all, i have watched this show since i was a little toddler, and i have always loved it. sure, maybe i didn't understand it when i was that young, but i still enjoyed it! and now that i have been able to understand it for several years, i love it even more. the score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score i have ever heard! every note is perfect, i don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!<br /><br />moving on to this particular production- this is magnificent! of course no one could play mrs. lovett besides angela lansbury, and she does it perfectly. and she should, she has been playing this part for several years. george hearn is absolutely brilliant. the best sweeney todd i have ever heard. he has a wonderful voice, yet he can throw his voice so well! his "epiphany" is incredible, as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it. the judge, toby, antony, and pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. everyone is perfect! well, i still have to fast forward through johanna's green finch and linnet bird. she just doesn't sing that song well at all.<br /><br />this show can be appreciated at all ages, but it is not always accepted. i am not your typical middle-aged theater lover, i am only 15 years old, yet sweeney todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than i have gotten from any other musical.
