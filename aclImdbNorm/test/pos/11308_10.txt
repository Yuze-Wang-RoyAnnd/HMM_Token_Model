this parody is cleverly done: from the songs (express yourself becomes expose yourself, like a prayer is now party in my pants and vogue is now vague) to the fake interviews of the cast of the show, this movie is hilarious. remember madonna saying she didn't know about the rain season in asia? in this one, she doesn't know about the volcano season. it is a precious jewel. they got a lot of money on that spoof, and it pays off. highly recommended!!!
