i loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and suited their roles. the story itself was great (and true, the setting was perfect and the message about human response to the war, danger and risk was exceptional. the person who wrote the music score also did the music for life is beautiful (another favourite of mine)- his comment was apparently that "...this was not a like an english movie, it was like an italian movie." i think he's right! callum blue is perfect for the part of eric newby. i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a story that is true and morally uplifting as well as a beautiful love story.
