better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the american box office. at times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, jekyll and hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the woody allen of "everything you always wanted to know about sex" to the mel brooks of "the producers", saturday night live to monty python, carlin to cheech and chong. watch it, listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly, and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensively hilarious.
