prot (kevin spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called k-pax. his psychiatrist, dr. mark powell (jeff bridges) tries to help him, all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from k-pax.<br /><br />this movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre. one big part of k-pax is drama/ science-fiction, another part fantasy, plus, add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what k-pax is all about. the story (as you see above) isn't too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me. no special effects or graphics accompany this movie, and there's no need to have them, the music in the film is great however. a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes k-pax sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes intriguing.<br /><br />kevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (prot) from the planet k-pax, emotional with great facial expressions, spacey does a fine job in the lead role. jeff bridges is dr. powell, that aids and attempts to understand prot. bridges is also excellent in his part. bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should, after all, they've both had a lot of experience. the wife of dr. powell is rachel powell, played by mary mccormack. mccormack plays her part well, showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient. alfe woodard plays dr. powell's coworker claudia villars, we don't really see claudia too much, but overall she puts in an alright performance.<br /><br />k-pax is rated pg-13 for "a sequence of violent images, and brief language and sensuality", and that covers it. as far as "violent images" go, we don't see too much. a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them, but that's all. language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "s" words, and a few uses of the lord's name in vain. not too bad really. the "sensuality" part is just from when prot explains to dr. powell how reproduction works on k-pax, nothing terrible, just something about it feels like "having your nuts in a vice." not too bad on the content level for a pg-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse.<br /><br />in conclusion, k-pax is not a bad movie. it won't stun you, but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch. it has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and, well you know what i mean. it's a story of a mental hospital patient, what do you expect? all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to, k-pax is a well done movie.<br /><br />bonus! if you've seen this movie already, like it, and are thinking about getting the dvd, i would highly recommend it. it has loads of extras to look through, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10
