i saw this back in 99 and i remember loving it. still to this day i can remember parts of the movie in my head, like the slanted pitch. unfortunately from 99 - now i could never remember the name of this until i was looking through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and came across this (he played clive kennard). straight away after reading the description i knew what it was. after catching up i was shocked to find out that not only did it not make a release on video or dvd but still has yet to be repeated. this is a massive shame, i am begging you itv at least repeat this superb tv movie. nick hancock showed in this movie he could do more than just host a show with his character mike tonker. this is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who aren't too keen on the sport would be able to enjoy the comedic value of this. yes this is a brief review but there is not much to say apart from this is an underrated movie, deserves to be repeated or released on video/dvd so itv, myself and other fans of this movie beg you. please consider one of those!
