almost no information is available about this movie, or its air dates. after an ongoing and exhaustive search i found the dvd to be available for 3.99!-release date february 28, 2006. try yahoo/dvd and video. in order to get this information posted i will continue to state that this is a well made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. it is a chance to see william l. peterson before c.s.i. turned him into a star. equally featured in the story is the venerable barbara hershey - does anyone remember when she was barbara hershey seagull? i have to keep writing to get this posted. thank you to the previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure tv film which obviously leaves a lasting impression on many.
