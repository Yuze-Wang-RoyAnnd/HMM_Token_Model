that pretty much sums it up ... corny. macdowell's inability to act is at times painful, and hurt must need money to take such muted roles, but i still enjoyed it.<br /><br />why? in a single word, travolta. he is great in this movie. still, i can't give the movie too high a score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting.
