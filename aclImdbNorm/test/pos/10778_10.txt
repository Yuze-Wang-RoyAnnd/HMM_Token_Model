with boundless, raw energy and an uncompromising vision, talk radio brilliantly explores the public's fondness for reducing strangers' private problems into entertainment via the radio.<br /><br />eric bogosian is sensational as barry champlaine, a rude, in-your-face talk radio host. he's a natural for this kind of role, and fine tunes one of the most impressive, interesting radio personalities i've ever seen on screen. the timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius.<br /><br />alec baldwin also shines as barry's boss. he demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992's glengarry glen ross. but the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned, seemingly brain-dead teen played by michael wincott. you have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />oliver stone and robert richardson do a great job with the photography, which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcasting room. the claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone. after all, one of the major points of the film is exploiting people's private moments to draw an audience. stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience.<br /><br />talk radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact - the likes of which are seldom seen today.
