the best of everything. just what is the best of everything? it is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. but alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. this story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. but as the saying goes,"we are the captains of our own ships", and so it goes for our lives. we are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. once we make those choices then we must live with them. as we watch this story and as we see these women making choices that most likely change their lives forever, we wonder, would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? who knows?
