are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary "don't look now" depicts venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see "just married" with ashton kutcher and brittany murphy). having never been to venice i can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from luchino visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. having seen the movie i now wish i had gotten around to reading the thomas mann novella it's based on (which also inspired an opera by sir benjamin britten). since i don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition, i'm left wondering about aschenbach (dirk bogarde)'s obsession with young tadzio. is he a homosexual? a pedophile? or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? perhaps tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long, and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace. the film benefits from the ravishing music of gustave mahler, on whom aschenbach's character is clearly based. dirk bogarde gives a moving performance, and the movie is graced by the presence of silvana mangano, one of italy's great beauties, as tadzio's mother.
