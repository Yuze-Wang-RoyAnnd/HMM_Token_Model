the first in a new style of films for lamas- no tattoo's, motorcycles or karate. i, for one, miss them. but this is a serious movie. he plays a fbi profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. gary busey is either a great actor or somebody i wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street. kristen cloke pursues lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer. there is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending. it seems to never come - there is always one more layer to the story. cloke and lamas start out as the good guys, turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes. but it's definitely worth the rental price. for maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar,a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. you're going to the movies!
