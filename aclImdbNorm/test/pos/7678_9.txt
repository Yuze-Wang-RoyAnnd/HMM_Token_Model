it is a shame that the gershwin family and goldwyn estate has pulled this great movie from the viewing, thereby depriving the public from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into one motion picture. <br /><br />it is also true that the singing voices for sidney poitier and dorothy dandridge were dubbed for this movie, and that is used as one of the reasons that the gershwin's do not want this movie ever released again.<br /><br />for in spite the flaws in the movie and the creative differences between the gershwins and the goldwyns, this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever committed to the screen. sammy davis, jr. and pearl bailey are especially deserving praise.<br /><br />this film was the great independent producer samuel golwyn's swan song. it was also ironically, the gershwin's greatest shame.<br /><br />finally, it is a loss to the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. for we can no longer see them at their best.
