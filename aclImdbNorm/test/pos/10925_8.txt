i've just seen this movie, and it made me cry. it's a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love, and i think it's a good idea, especially for the closed-minded, to watch this one. i have come to love the short-film genre after just having seen a couple, because they have to make an impression on you so fast, and i have to say that this one definitely sat it's mark. it described some things, that i haven't ever really thought about that way, incest for one.<br /><br />i have to admit that i did not care too much for the ending. just once i would like to watch a gay-themed movie without wanting to kill myself after wards. they seem to pretty much always end in tragedy. it was 'cute' though, how that they had to be together, even if it was in death.<br /><br />i gave it eight stars, and i recommend it too everyone, cause i think it gives an 'inside-look' in the world, that this movie make you enter.<br /><br />thanks for listening, enjoy.
