fame was released in the u.s. a year before i was born; i was too young to ever remember the original version of fame- and yet i heard and read numerous things about it. such as the fact that it spawned a tv series and that its soundtrack was led by the irene cara, giogio moroder hit, 'fame'.<br /><br />fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film. the lives, the struggles, the hurdles the students and some of the teachers undergo themselves were under the eye of the viewers.<br /><br />the performances were great, yet one which caught my eye in particular was gene anthony ray, who played the troublesome yet promising leroy. angry, frustrated and at first rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies- not just with the practical in the performing but in the theoretical too. irene cara was good as coco- the scene with her taking her blouse off while some pervy director was filming her was rather discomforting to watch-, as well as paul mccrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and enrolling on a performing arts school in new york, after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay. ralph played by barry miller was interesting but at times, his character did grate on my nerves.<br /><br />the choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. another scene that was great was when the 'fame' song was played and all the kids started rushing out into the streets of new york and danced wildly and without a care in the world. it was a street jam like no other.<br /><br />the only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is debbie allen- she later became a producer, director and star- though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as everybody hates chris and the fresh prince of bel air. paul mccrane later went on to star alongside peter weller in the movie, 'robocop', where he played a villain and e.r. as the judgemental, obnoxious doctor romano.<br /><br />british director alan parker shot this really well- he allowed the performers to dance, act, sing to their hearts content without wanting to interfere with and affect their styles.<br /><br />throughout the duration of the movie, we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years- from their auditions to freshman year, all the way up to graduation in new york's high school for the arts.<br /><br />fame is one of those movies which caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community- it is definitely not for everyone.<br /><br />i for one enjoyed it because i have an interest in the arts- not technically in terms of being a performer because i am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be channelled through hard work, commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents. therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor- or just someone who is creative, you might be interested in a movie such as this- though whether the events in fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college/school in real life, then that is a completely different matter altogether.<br /><br />the 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly, it virtually pales by comparison. <br /><br />as for the original fame, almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie, nonetheless.<br /><br />it's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic, in line with other 80s dance hit movies, such as footloose and flashdance, fame hits the spot. isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter 'f'? <br /><br />gritty, moving and intriguing, this one is worth a watch.
