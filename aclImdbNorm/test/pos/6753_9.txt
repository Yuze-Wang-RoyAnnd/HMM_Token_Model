i agree with most of mr. rivera's comments, and i just want to ad a couple of caveats. this film, "the mascot" is criminally neglected in its current form. for that matter, so is "vampyr". "the mascot" isn't a "bonus feature"-- it's tacked on as a chapter in "vampyr". even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie, it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers. and while i"m at it, "vampyr" needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well. i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like this.<br /><br />dude a: "we just transferred vampyr to dvd, but it comes up about 20 minutes short. we need to put something on there that won't cost much money. can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films!" dude b: "not to worry. i have this little animation thingy that's been sitting in my drawer. just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter." dude a: "you're awesome, dude b." the animation's of the mascot is great, and there's no need for me to repeat what mr. rivera's done so well. however, this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring, especially the audio. the plot comes through in the dialogue. and in my copy there were so many hisses, pops and places where the sound just dropped right off (i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box). no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable, it just brought up the tinniness and made the hisses and pops louder.<br /><br />bottom line is: starewicz's films need to be put into a respectful collection, cleaned up, spiffed up, liner notes and the whole nine yards. in other words, they need to be "criterionized" 9 out of 10 for the movie, not the product which would get only a 5.
