i first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and i loved it, i decided to get the dvd last year for my birthday.. it has the right amount of suspense, action and drama.. this movie is about prep school called the regis school and its packed with rebellious kids, in which one kid william tepper (sean astin) has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at the regis school committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader luis cali's (andrew divoff) father has been sent to prison,and the leader will do anything including killing the students, setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back.<br /><br />along side william tepper, is his rebellious friends at the regis school, one in particular is joey trotta (wil wheaton) in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent to the regis school because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school, so william, joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics.<br /><br />this movie was really awesome and i believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say "die hard" and even though i would have to agree with them, they need to recognize that toy soldiers was a good thriller, it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and i would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school ... but overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and if i had a decision to rent or buy it... i would buy it! i recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10
