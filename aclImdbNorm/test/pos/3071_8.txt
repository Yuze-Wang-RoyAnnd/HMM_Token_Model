i first saw robin hood: men in tights back in 1994 in the cinema. i went to see it because i always liked robin hood and i saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious. after i saw the movie i must say it was even better than i thought. not only is it very funny, it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by hummie mann. the acting in the movie is also good, cary elwes is funny as robin hood and also tracey ullman, richard lewis, mark blankfield, david chapelle, amy yasbeck, megan cavanagh, eric allan kramer, matthew porretta and mel brooks himself are funny. but the best part in the movie is played by roger rees as the evil sheriff of rottingham. he has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue ("king illegal forest to pig wild kill in it a is", which stands for "it is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest").he somehow mixes up all the words and speaks out a sentence that nobody understands. robin hood: men in tights is in my book one of the best mel brooks films to date and i can't say that i have laughed as much about a film as this one. it's just non-stop laughing.
