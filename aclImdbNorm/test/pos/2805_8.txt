this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their "erasmus year" in barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in europe and is an ideal location. <br /><br />the idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. there are some clich'es about the countries but most of them are true! the characters could not better represent their different countries.<br /><br />having experienced "erasmus" on myself during my exchang semester in italy i can say that is movie is incredibly authentic. i had many experiences which were similar to the characters (except i didn't get laid as often). the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college movies.<br /><br />finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work life.<br /><br />9/10 (i may not be very objective though)
