wladyslaw starewicz was a russian-born animator living in france who did incredible things using stop-motion. i've seen a couple of these films before and they feature his favorite subjects--insects, frogs and various animals. they are extremely realistic and lifelike and even today are amazing to watch--the quality is simply fantastic.<br /><br />this one stars lots and lots of frogs. they appeal to their god, jupiter, to give them a king. why do they need a king, wonders jupiter--their lives are perfectly fine now. so, to teach them a nasty lesson, he makes an egret the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects! then, the frogs once again appeal to jupiter, who states the obvious moral that it's best to be happy with what you have! <br /><br />while the animation quality is incredible, this is a very creepy film for kids. i would think this would terrify them both by how real the animals look as well as the story itself which is not for the faint of heart!
