although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. i saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...i just had to live in new york. it has great opening shots of the manhattan skyline with johnny mathis crooning "romance is still...the best of everything..." that rival those of west side story. there is a rather stilted performance by the world's real first supermodel, suzy parker (sorry about that, janice d.), but it's great eye-candy! it also offers a bit of insight into late 1950's american mores--our obsession with (and repression of) sex (in the workplace, no less!), romance, and marriage before women's lib. it represents an era in which new york was at it's finest and a super-bitchy performance by joan crawford is just the icing on the cake.
