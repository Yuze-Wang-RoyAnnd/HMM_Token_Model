it's strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you've seen. this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller, guns, techno, baddies, cash, etc, and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also-ran. i would credit this to two very charismatic people. christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women i've ever seen on screen. another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to jamaica after the beginning. the jamaican resort is so beautiful you'll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night, with a run'n'coke. . . .i know i did. i'm very glad i saw this movie - it was just too nice to miss!
