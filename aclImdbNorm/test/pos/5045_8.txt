"autumn spring" tells of the misadventures of a dapper, walrus faced, 78 (approx) year old czech man who haplessly befuddles and bemuses all who know him with his mischievous ways while his wife meticulously plans her funeral. centerpiece hana (brodsk'y) shows us how to get babes to kiss you when your 78 and how to cop a feel in an elevator and get thanked for it as he pranks his way from day to day in this warm and glowing look at old age and one man's creative, amusing, but socially unacceptable ways of enjoying life while refusing to be relegated to the old folk's home. "autumn spring" is a plodding, subtle comedy with messages for all ages which will have the greatest appeal with more mature foreign film buffs. (b+)
