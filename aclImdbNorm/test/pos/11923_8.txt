it's really not worthy of a 'best picture' consideration, but as entertainment goes, it does the job! this is one that i've watched, with pulse quickening every time, at least a dozen times.<br /><br />most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other work. those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it.<br /><br />this was a fun adventure. sort of like the little rascals if they just had to be serious.
