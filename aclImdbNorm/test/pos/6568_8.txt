it's very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer. while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves, i embrace "uzumaki" for its irreverence. there is a plot, it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. this is a film that invites numerous interpretations, as all great art does - however, this film is also very entertaining, making it a rare film experience. it's simultaneously provocative and fun.
