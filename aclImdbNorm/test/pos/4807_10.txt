having seen 'only' about 200 hong kong films in my time, i have to say this film is among my very top favorites. not only is the plot engaging (and in some ways surprising, which these days is rare for any movie), but the chemistry between the two lead actors is superb. top notch casting! and while often even the most serious hk films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action, often spoiling the mood a bit, here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot, even improving character relations. the music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very beautiful. with the release of the hk special edition, they've even cleaned the picture (first release was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). all in all, if you have to see a hk film that isn't directed by john woo or have chow yun fat in it, this should be at least on your short list! a truly fascinating and entertaining watch!
