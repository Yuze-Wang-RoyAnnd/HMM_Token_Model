unfortunately, due to a sluggish start, i can't say that this is one of hitch's best films. it very excellent none the less. the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back. they both give excellent performances, not surprising of course. really, however, i was most impressed with hitchcocks amazing use of music. the climax at the opera house was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius. absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. also, the use of doris day singing "que sera, sera" was excellent. especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film. so, this film to me ends up being hitchcocks best use of music that i have seen to date. unfortunately it had a slow start, or i could have recommend this film a little more highly. even then, it is still well worth a look. 8 out of 10.
