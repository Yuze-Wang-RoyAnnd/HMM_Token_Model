[minor spoilers follow]<br /><br />steve allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula: tragedy+time=comedy. 1939 before the german assault on poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events, including the blitzkrieg (following the sitzkrieg) which took germany to the channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation at dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine france prostrating its honor before the nazi conqueror.<br /><br />the stuff of romance, comedy and a big dollop of serious drama? yep. director jean-paul rappeneau, with a well-matched and outstanding cast, creates in "bon voyage" a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining.<br /><br />viviane denvers (the sloe-eyed and beautiful isabelle adjani) is france's top actress as war clouds gather over europe (what an overused cliche, sorry). a veteran self-venerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be "whatever is good for viviane is good for...viviane). following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent reynaud administration, jean-etienne beaufort (gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, she goes home only to tiredly encounter an ex-lover who doesn't understand the word "no." she decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau, the still besotted frederic (gregory derangere), to help deal with the mess in her flat. frederic is a novelist-in-expectation.<br /><br />a comic accident that once again highlights, almost as a public service message, the importance of working windshield wipers puts frederic in jail on most serious charges. fortunately the breakout of the germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes, making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state.<br /><br />the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story. who should frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant, camille (virginie ledoyen) who is accompanying the obligatory jewish refugee scientist, professor kopolski (jean-marc stehle). kopolski has some bottles of "heavy water" he needs to get to england. of course the germans musn't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what (this part is pure fiction-there was never any heavy water in france in 1940-just perrier). and camille is so winsome as well as dedicated.<br /><br />what next? peter coyote as a supposed french journalist, alex winckler. be tipped off as to his name. he's really an officer in the abwehr (german military intelligence: a spy). and he used to bed viviane too (and wants a reprise of their affair). apparently the kind kopolski is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress.<br /><br />what follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fast-paced and enjoyable film. partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on "casablanca," this is is a remarkably funny movie (except for the heavy nazi bits).<br /><br />isabelle adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal i've seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few if any redeeming features. and depardieu, disloyal to reynauld and ready to jump ship and join the traitor, petain, is convincing as a man whose ardor for viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the republic. as a human being in power at a critical moment in french history, beaufort is mundanely vile.<br /><br />not shown in too many theaters, "bon voyage" should be available for purchase or rental soon. see it!<br /><br />9/10
