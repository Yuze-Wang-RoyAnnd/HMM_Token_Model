this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space 1999 (first series). of course it isn't some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudo-mystic tripe fest, but a subtle movie that has a slow pace, yet it conveys the creepy, eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions: for lovers of 'cerebral' sci-fi. lynn loring's voice is absolutely awful. sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well. two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home instead...or do they? ah, videophones! every now and then peddled as the next 'everyone's gadget next decade' but still to happen 40 years later. the device of earth's twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron (1969), so who copied whom?
