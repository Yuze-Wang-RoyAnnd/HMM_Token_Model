this film does for infantry what das boot did for submariners. if you appreciated das boot then that is all you really need to know.<br /><br />this is a well done piece of cinema. on a par with das boot. basically it follows a company of elite german "stormtrooper" infantry who leave garrison duty in an idyllic italian seaside town and are immediately thrust into the chaos of the disintegrating russian front. <br /><br />a good war movie illuminates both the senselessness and brutality of war and at the same time gives us insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight. this movie does that. the film is full of drama and action and so is entertaining on that level as well.
