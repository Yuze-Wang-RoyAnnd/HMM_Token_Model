i saw dark harbor at the '98 seattle film festival. filmed against a autumnal maine backdrop, this movie boasts an excellent cast and a plot that keeps you guessing throughout. at times eerie, at times funny, i have to say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it. rickman and walker are wonderful as the icy marrieds and reedus is someone you'll be hearing more from, i'm sure. the opening shot of a winding, deserted road in a downpour at dusk (and the score that accompanied it) set the tone so well -- just terrific. nice, nice work from a new-ish director/screenwriter and his talented crew.
