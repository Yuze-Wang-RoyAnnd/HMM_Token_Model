i think it was a pretty good film. it shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him it led to his destruction. it shows that you can't trust anyone especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy.the character that i mostly liked was sebeva. she was another ambitious, powerful and ruthless woman in a man's world who loved and respected kilo. she also knew that business was business and a dangerous one. everything she did was risky but got the job done. she helped kilo become rich with her connections. overall, i really liked this film and have it in my collection and waiting for el padrino 2.
