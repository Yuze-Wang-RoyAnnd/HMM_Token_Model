this film was so well-paced that i don't think i actually blinked while watching. one intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. however, i would have liked to have seen corey feldman a lot more in this picture. he just steals every scene that he is in. this could be my favorite grown up corey performance. the ending was clever and unlike other films which back away from severing body parts of likeable supporting characters, this film goes for it! i liked that it was not graphic blood and gore but left more to the viewer's imagination. bravo. i literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. ultimately, the film works because of its likeable lead character and the awesome presence of my all-time favorite bad guy, james remar(48 hours, remember?) i strongly recommend this film for anyone looking to break a sweat.<br /><br />
