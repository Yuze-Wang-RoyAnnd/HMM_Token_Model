gore hounds beware...this is not your movie. this little nail bitter has very little blood and guts. its basically a version of open water that is effective and worthwhile. but what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads (unlike open water) who find themselves up a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boat and munches up their guide. we don't want any harm to come to any of them. so when they start getting into dangerous situations...we actually care. <br /><br />now i like killer animal flicks but i haven't been too impressed with lake placid up to primeval (although i'm still waiting to see rogue and hoping it is somewhere as good as this one!) but this little bugger did the job and did the job well. it's scares are creative and it only lapses into the run of the mill frantic crying sobbing and arguing for brief stints of realism so i never got annoyed. <br /><br />i remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile . but the thing that always impacted me that gets left out from the film was that the crocodile didn't eat up the buddy. no. for hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree. seeming to stay, if you come down here this is what will happen to you.
