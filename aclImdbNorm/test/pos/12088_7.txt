first of all, i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary. not only it had great music in it, but the shots and the editing were also wonderful. however, all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist "east meets west" clich'e that bothers many turks like myself. okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds. however, the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as "east" from the eyes of the "west". i mean, like one jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no east and west, maybe it is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of "western" countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and "keep the cash flowing"? <br /><br />why don't you think about that?
