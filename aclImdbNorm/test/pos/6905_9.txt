this film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of hollywood crap i've seen recently. the acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing. there really isn't much to the story, it's simple and it works well. an easy film to just sit down and enjoy. the mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals. the film obviously has aspects of horror, yet is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things. you won't be laughing out loud hysterically with this one, but you'll be smiling the whole way through. the humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn't hurt. i really watched this movie based on the fact that ron perlman was in it. his role is a bit smaller than i expected, but it doesn't matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged. if you like horror, watch this. if you like comedies, watch this. just go ahead and watch this anyway, it's really quite excellent.
