my god, this was a fantastic film. every time we watch it takes us to another place of "wow". rhett & scarlett were played brilliantly by joanne & timothy. they did a fantastic job revising the roles of our two favourite heros. everyone! it is a must see..... dont deprive yourself of this movie. if u loved gone with the wind you will love this mini series. go rhett!!! go scarllett!!!
