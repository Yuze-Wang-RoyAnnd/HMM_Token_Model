a wonderful film in the best scandinavian eldritch magic tradition, with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face.<br /><br />should be compulsory viewing for all politicians.<br /><br />take your pick from privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life.<br /><br />reminiscent of thoreaus' walden, but with modern twist, and considerable humour. <br /><br />i'm not finnish, although i've travelled there and have good finnish friends, but i found it totally accessible, and also culturally informative.
