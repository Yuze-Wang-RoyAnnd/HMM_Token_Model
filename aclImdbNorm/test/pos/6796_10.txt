ccmovieman-1 must be, as the reviewer in the new york times who preferred the janis joplin big brother and the holding company album to the just released beatles'"white" album was called, either evil or insane. national velvet is a great film. elizabeth taylor's performance is fantastic, and i fail to discern even a trace of accent, much less too much of one. her performance is very natural, authentic and unbelievably charming. the rest of the cast is superb, especially rooney and revere. <br /><br />as far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental, i suggest cc has dined too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine straight-forward emotion and human interaction. there was a time when people actually did think and talk in such a manner. not that this film doesn't have a slight hint of the magical permeating through it. that is the reason to tell the story. one might as well criticize the wizard of oz, king kong, the maltese falcon, casablanca, the black stallion ( the other great horse film ) or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem richer than real life. no my friend, national velvet endures because of its belief firmly in itself, with tongue firmly not in cheek. something today's jaded filmmakers find nearly impossible to recreate.
