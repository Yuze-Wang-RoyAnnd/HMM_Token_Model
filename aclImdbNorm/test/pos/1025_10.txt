there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around , that 20 years later , it wont hold the same magic as it did before. i must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised. p'tang yang kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old .this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess. it is engrossing , it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that. john albasiny and abigail cruttenden's rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now. i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me. p'tang yang kipperbang eehhh! 10 out of 10.
