to be honest fellow imdb reviewers, i enjoyed this show a lot. the reason? well, it didn't try to be more than it is; i mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, with a well known and repeated plot, funny and talented actors, and clever jokes oriented for a post college audience.<br /><br />this is what grown ups is all about: trying to be mature but in a funny way.<br /><br />jaleel white is funny as always and delivers some witty, and hilarious sex oriented jokes. the humor is very 90's without taking in account the tendencies of the new millennium and that's the main reason in my opinion why the show didn't have success. it got stuck in the 90's.<br /><br />oh and mrs. ribisi was really funny and perky.<br /><br />my favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma biting the ass! not a cult classic but i'm sure it's part of regular early 2000's nostalgia.
