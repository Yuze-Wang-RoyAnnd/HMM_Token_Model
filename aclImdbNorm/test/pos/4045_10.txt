people comparing this movie to big blockbusters like lord of the rings or the matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. the acting talent, although not a-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an a-list cast. my particular favourite from this movie is bridget fonda, whose performance as the snow queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup. she injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from hollywood, which i think is a good thing since hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on cgi and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger.
