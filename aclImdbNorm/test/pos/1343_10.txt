one of the best memories of my childhood. should be on dvd. it captured everything we grew up with in the seventies - peace, mellowness, flower power and great acoustic music. the two hosts, carol and paula, were the definitive peacenik hippies, with long hair, peasant blouses and bell bottoms(they looked like a katherine ross(ala "the graduate") and ali mcgraw(ala "love story"),respectively.)<br /><br />they made us happy with jokes from the daisy "chucklepatch", gave us lessons on being nice through conversations with the crotchedy garden squirrel, and entertained us with music from their guitar. they were the best, and carol was also the original sandy in the original production of "grease"(cool).<br /><br />this show should be in a time capsule from the era that would also include, "the yellow submarine", "arrow to the sun", and marlo thomas', "free to be...you & me.", also, "sunshine", and "the point."<br /><br />and last, but not least, that theme song, "see ya, see ya, hope you had a good, good time, ah ha, glad we got to say good mornin' to ya , hope we get get to see ya again, see ya, see ya, glad that you could stay awhile, ah ha, hope we get see ya again, see ya, see ya.
