this bbc series is excellent. i am no paleontologist, but this series gives the best historical representation of dinosaurs i have ever seen. the 3d animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe you have travelled back in time. the bbc deserves a pat on the back for such a fine series as well as tim haines who must have spent a great deal of time getting this series to air.
