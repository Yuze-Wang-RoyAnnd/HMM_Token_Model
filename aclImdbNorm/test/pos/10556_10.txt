what a great movie this is. i found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl. and it is set in a tropical island 'paradise'as well. <br /><br />gerard depardeiux brings his special european flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl. they are on holiday together and she begins to add to the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways. but you will need to see the film for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves.<br /><br />there are a few cult classics which all teens should see. this movie should be added to the list. in addition to dirty dancing, ferris bueller's day off, bill and ted's excellent adventure, rocky horror picture show and animal house, my father the hero should be required film study. watch it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll be rolling with laughter. watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to be laughed at for months.
