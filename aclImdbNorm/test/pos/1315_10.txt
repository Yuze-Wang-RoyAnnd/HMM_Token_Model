this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art. this is an oblivious labour of love by the schrader brothers about the life of yukio mishima that is full truly artistic elements. the movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works by mishima to him. all without being confusing in the least bit. the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in japanese. still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won. criterion, if you are reading this, this is a film that should be released under your imprint with as much extras as possible. this film truley deserves more. 10/10
