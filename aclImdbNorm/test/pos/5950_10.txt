this is the latest entry in the long series of films with the french agent, o.s.s. 117 (the french answer to james bond). the series was launched in the early 1950's, and spawned at least eight films (none of which was ever released in the u.s.). 'o.s.s.117:cairo,nest of spies' is a breezy little comedy that should not...repeat not, be taken too seriously. our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in egypt (with morroco doing stand in for egypt) to find out about a long lost friend. what follows is the standard james bond/inspector cloussou kind of antics. although our man is something of an overt xenophobe,sexist,homophobe, it's treated as pure farce (as i said, don't take it too seriously). although there is a bit of rough language & cartoon violence, it's basically okay for older kids (ages 12 & up). as previously stated in the subject line, just sit back,pass the popcorn & just enjoy.
