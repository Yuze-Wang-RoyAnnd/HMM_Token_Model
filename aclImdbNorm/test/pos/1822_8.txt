this movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong nicolas cage fan. back in the mid-80's i taped this movie (when vcr's were impossible to do this with!!) and would watch it over and over. nicolas cage is just brilliant here. and, he looks wonderful and has no affecting "acting-isms" (see "peggy sue got married" to know what i mean about that!!). i measure all his performances against this one. he was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends. the music was great. the plimsouls! the psychodelic furs! modern english! men at work! whenever i hear "melt with you" i am taken back to the finale of this movie. <br /><br />what ever happened to his cute costar, deborah foreman? and his hysterical friend, cameron dye? certainly took a different turn than nicolas! interestingly, the slutty friend (elizabeth daily) ended up being the voice of tommy from the rugrats (she is billed as e.g. daily for that horrid show)! bizarre!<br /><br />if you want to take a great trip back to the 80's, watch this movie. it is definitely a classic. like totally!
