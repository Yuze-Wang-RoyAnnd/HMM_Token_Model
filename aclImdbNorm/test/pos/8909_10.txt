in fact, the nature of the whole series is irrepressibly funny! but not always funny... there are moments of extreme poignance as the deeper aspects of human emotion are touched on. <br /><br />over and again, the series comments on the frailties of human nature and the life long, or in this case eternal, struggle to overcome them. monkey is both smart and stupid at the same time, his arrogance and reliance on his own martial skills lead him into trouble in almost every episode. pigsy is just plain gross. sandy has a philosophical turn of mind. he has many of the wittiest lines. <br /><br />the english translation is a delight. "ignorance can always be improved upon," drawls sandy in his laid-back manner, "but you can't do anything to help stupidity!" "who are you?" the group of travellers are asked. "we three kings of orient are," says monkey. <br /><br />this is not just for children, it is a magical romp for anyone who can suspend reality
