this movie is breath-taking and mind-blowing. but i think maybe it can only be appreciated by die-hard rpg funs. it is like a game. one problem is the plot is too game-like and just has too many twists. the twists are excessive. jude law gives a very good performance. i really like him in this movie, just as jerome in gattaca and gigglo joe in a.i.
