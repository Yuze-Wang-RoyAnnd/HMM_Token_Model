let me just say - i love the horror genre to the extent that i see every single one that i can get my hands on regardless (except really low quality b-movie horrors which i could do without) and recently have become a big fan of eastern horrors. little did i know that a korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the japanese ringu (or the american ring), or even quality us movies such as the sixth sense and the others, and the widely acclaimed hong kong horror 'the eye'.<br /><br />previously 'the ring' had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that i prefer the beauty of 'the tale of two sisters' any day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot... the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date. the acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the ring - i did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off. <br /><br />still i am glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that sadako/samara did from the ring - after all such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of two sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling, but one that hopefully won't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special. but do remember.. if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing, a repeat viewing is more than advised.. i personally didn't have time for this since it was late so i flicked through scenes on the dvd, some numerous times until i had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net, seemed ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation. and the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful.<br /><br />all in all - a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same 'level' remake (its been purchased by dreamworks) simply because of the korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on dvds while they can... its one of the best you will get. unfortunately due to the type of movie this is, there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'a tale of two sisters'! and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.
