rowan atkinson's mr. bean ranks right up there with laurel & hardy, buster keaton, the marx brothers and other comedy greats. i have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when i introduced them to mr. bean via my videos and now dvds. i'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. he was over for a visit and i asked him if he'd ever seen mr. bean? "who?" he said. so i got out my video and showed him the one where mr. bean is in church and starts to nod off. my brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard. he became an instant fan of mr. bean. we all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the fun is in sharing them with others. i have seen so many people laugh 'til it hurts! favorite episodes are: the visit of the queen, the hotel room stay, late for the dentist appointment, the christmas episode (a classic...plus kids love it!) and the new year party. rowan atkinson is a comic genius!
