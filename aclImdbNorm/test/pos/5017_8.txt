what is it about certain films that generates such polar opposite reactions?<br /><br />some people here have called high roller "disgusting." some have called it "extraordinary" (as would i, actually).<br /><br />why? i think it's because films like this don't make heroes out of jerks, or glamour out of degeneration, and some people just can't deal with that emotionally. they need a hero. and i'd also add that if they're gamblers or poker players, they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isn't justified.<br /><br />high roller in not a poker movie. it's a people movie. it's not perfect, but it looks good, is well-written, and wonderfully acted. and best of all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection.<br /><br />and maybe that's what makes some people so damn mad.
