20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around. never has a movie surpassed valley girl's incredible soundtrack. the movie completely encapsulated the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later. nicolas cage at his best. a movie that just has so much character to it, that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become (as far as quality goes). the special edition dvd is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to sift through. for sure.
