i saw 2:37 at the toronto international film festival in september and was blown away by it! a scene of panic opens this film, at 2:37 pm set in an adelaide high school. this scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day, and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school. the audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters, and explores the day-to-day issues facing teenagers - including drugs, promiscuity, being gay, bullying and violence. each scene is played again and again from different teens' perspectives, and is reminiscent of gus van sant's elephant. this is a remarkable film by first-time director murali k. thalluri. it was made with non-professional student actors, and work-shopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script. it features stunning performances by a number of the student actors, particularly teresa palmer in the role of melody. this coming-of-age film is both intimate and thought-provoking with a surprising and disturbing ending.
