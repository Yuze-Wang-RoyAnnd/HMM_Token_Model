yes, let's get this out of the way before we begin: *this is the one that sean connery returned to in 1983 after the stint we had of roger moore. *it's connery's last film. *and yes it's a (kind of) remake of thunderball, but more of a film inspired by it. if all you bond purists out there think i'm gonna get controversial, you're right. bond is one of the greatest movie series ever, but that doesn't mean that a series should go on forever. this, i think, is one of two films where they could've done themselves a huge favour and ended the bond saga. not offended yet? then i'll continue... hey, if you're thinking i'm indifferent about bond flicks, you're wrong. i grew up with my mum being obsessed with them. any spare moment, bond and his antics would be on the tv. bond rules, and 'never say never again' (directed by irvin 'empire strikes back' kershner) is one of the best. it may not be 'goldfinger' or 'from russia...' and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others (which i hear is why they refuse to accept it was ever made!?), but still stands head and shoulders above the recent brosnan outings... (if you haven't spat at the screen, read on). characterization!!!!! something so many blockbuster films forget about these days, but something which is essential to telling a good story. 'never' played a superb hand by treating 007 like he had been ageing since 'dr. no'. he's 'getting on a bit' and so has to do things like go to a health farm - a direct order from 'm' (!). yeah, if you haven't seen this film, i won't give too much away with the plot because a) loads happens and b) obviously, i want you to see it for yourselves. don't be put off by my 'old bond' revelation, connery still get plenty of superb set pieces to charge, swim, punch, speed, smash, and snog his way through. the man is a legend, and this film is one of his most enjoyable outings as bond. high tech gadgets galore, some great villains, and an excellent supporting cast (including a fantastic cameo by rowan atkinson) lift this movie high above audience expectation.<br /><br />this could've been the last bond film ever, and it would've been a party to remember. playing the secret agent as someone nearing retirement was refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene wraps things up perfectly for the series.... ...but still we had more, and then more, and more still, and one more moore. still, if you fancy finding out what "fatima blush" is all about, get this film. then you can at least pretend 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent, in the arms of kim basinger, and smirking at mr. bean. (p.s. * that other film that i think could've finished it all off? the gritty 'license to kill'
