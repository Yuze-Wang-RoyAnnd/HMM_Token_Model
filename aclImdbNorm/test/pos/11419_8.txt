with all the shoot em up, blood horror movies that have come our way in the last little while "saw, hostal, saw 2, the hills have eyes" yes, they have their place, don't get me wrong! i went to see "when a stranger calls" with my buddy the other night! why? because it's a remake of the 1979 classic, which at the time was excellent and scared the you know what out of everyone! i didn't know what to expect. however i was pleasantly surprised! it was a film made of mood, atmosphere, suspense! because remember people, what you can't see, what you think you see, what you can't hear, or what you think you hear, is far more scarier then what you do! if you love films with mood, creepiness, suspense and atmosphere!! you'll love it! it brought it back to the roots of the original halloween. thumbs up, a solid 8.5 out of 10 remember folks, it's well done! not perfect! it's spooky, not bloody, it's creepy, not gory! it was nice to see a film come a long like this. our minds have been conditioned and warped by the glitz and shock value of modern day horror movies, we forget, what's really scary.
