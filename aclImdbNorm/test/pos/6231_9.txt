i really really liked this one. i know, it's rampant with what are now clich'e plot lines, and plenty of overacting, but it was hell of a lot of fun.<br /><br />in our quest for 70's and 80's horror cheese, we come across many flicks that are so bad they're good. we also have some that are so 'good' they suck, and then, we have some that are so bad they are just bad. this is definitely so bad it's good.<br /><br />some teens traveling come across an 'oasis' in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten slice of roadside america, and they decide to 'check it out.' they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it. they pay dearly.<br /><br />i would not normally give a movie like this a 9, but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the 1970's: ditzy, scantily-clad and fit. these aren't the anorexic broads from today's horrible horror; they look awesome in booty shorts.<br /><br />i give it a 9 out of 10, kids.
