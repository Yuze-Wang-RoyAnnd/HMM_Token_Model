wtf!! do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? the notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. i'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. don't we already know what really happens in real life? can't we - for one moment (an hour and a half) live vicariously through a movie that ends on a happy note - that gives us hope for our own futures??? <br /><br />yeah - wah. i know. but for real, i think we need to preface movies that end like this one with a warning. "beware: no happy ending."
