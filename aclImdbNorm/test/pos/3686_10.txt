i wonder why i haven't heard of this movie before. it's truly a magnificent comedy (i'd say farce, but it's too well acted and i'd hate to denigrate it's quality). a comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs kathy bates and rupert everett to a wonderful effect. forget julia roberts and rupert; kathy bates and rupert should do another movie together. the anxiety-ridden, acerbic and outrageous daughter-in-law, maudie (meredith eaton), is a truly wonderful character. if you liked the tales of the city films, you'd like this quirky charmer.
