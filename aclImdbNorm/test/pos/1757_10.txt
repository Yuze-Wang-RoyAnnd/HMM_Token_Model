i have for years remembered a song "just a couple in a castle" ("no. twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in castle in the air"). i couldn't find the song, but i remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs. i located a reference to the movie on the web. i had seen the movie when i was only 9 year old at the ligonier pa theatre. i was pleased to find that it had kenny gardner the singer with guy lombaro (i am a lombardo fan). and then to see that it was produced by the fleisher bros. who did another very good full lengh cartoon feature of "gullivar's travels" (also remembered fondly). also the songs were associated with hoagy carmichael and frank loesser who are among the very best. no wonder i remembered the film, the song, and the colorful animation. as a full lengh musical this is a movie which should be remembered as a one of the best of the early full lengh musicals. now that i remember it, the plot may not have been earth shaking, but was very well presented and makes for a easy to watch abd delightful movie.
