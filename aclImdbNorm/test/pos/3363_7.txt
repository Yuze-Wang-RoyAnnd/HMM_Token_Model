overall, the dad's army movie is very funny, although the humour isn't quite as catchy and sparkly as in the tv and radio series. so where does this leave us, the viewers? if you've never seen dad's army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of walmington o/s. the downside is that you might not "get it" because, as i said, the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid side.<br /><br />for dad's army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a cutup of the tv series, but it's a unique chance of seeing your favourites in "high def" as compared to the shitty quality of the bbc video recordings.<br /><br />the movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe. i can't make up my mind if that's a positive or a negative, though.
