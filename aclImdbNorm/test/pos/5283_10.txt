my first exposure to japanese animation director hayao miyazaki and his studio ghibli production company was when an english-dubbed version of spirited away was released about 7 years ago. what a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was! so on that note, i managed to get my movie theatre-employed friend to see this new film of miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things disney (this movie's u.s. distributor). once again, all i can say is "wow!" what awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean...and what about the title character's transformation from a goldfish to...and seeing how some characters' demeanor changes...and, well, watch this movie if you want to know what i'm talking about. oh, and the voices being used for this american-dubbed version: tina fey, betty white, liam neeson, cloris leachman, and lily tomlin. good choices all. does everything make sense? no, but that's part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout. there's plenty of funny scenes concerning ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter. oh, i think i've written too much so i'll just highly recommend hayao miyazaki's ponyo.
