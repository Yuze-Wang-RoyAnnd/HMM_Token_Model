i, having both read and watched gone with the wind, found it very difficult to not compare this movie with the original. although i thought scarlett, the novel, was superb, the movie didn't add up. it was a completely different story. of course, there will never be another scarlett and rhett besides leigh and gable, but the new actors did a fine job, considering. i loved the way the book and movie wrapped up the story of gon with the wind, because after reading it i felt a surge of disappointment because it just stopped and left the readers to wonder what happened. scarlett finishes the story very well, and alexandra ripley did great on the book. i just wish the movie followed the story more, although it is great in itself.
