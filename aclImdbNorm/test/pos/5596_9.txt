race against fear has to be one of the most moving tv movies i've seen for a long time. all of the performances from the main actors were superb, especially that of ariana richards (mickey carlyle), william bullimer (coach kurt ansom), and susan blakely (margaret carlyle). ariana in particular put on an extremely emotional performance, with facial expressions to match. she portrayed the emotions that mickey was feeling perfectly, and you could easily believe that she really had been raped, so realistic was her performance.<br /><br />raf is an incredibly realistic movie, due to the moving performances from the cast. bullimer came across as a rapist incredibly well, and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed. blakely also put on an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl (mickey carlyle), and you felt increasingly sorry for the carlyle family because no-one believed them about the rape.<br /><br />all in all, raf is a great movie. it is both moving and full of suspense, as you are continually unsure if ansom would be prosecuted for the rape, due to the lack of witnesses, evidence, and belief in the claim. i thoroughly recommend seeing this movie.
