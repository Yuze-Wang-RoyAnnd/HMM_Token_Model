bullets may not have bounced off his chest, but the lone ranger was every bit the symbolic icon to me as my other boyhood hero - superman. he represented truth, justice and the american way in a classic tv western setting, living by the principle that he would never use his gun to kill, while scouring the american southwest with his faithful indian companion tonto to bring every single outlaw to justice. the advent of tv provided the perfect opportunity for a post war generation to find it's ideal in an enigmatic masked man who stood for law and order, while providing unparalleled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years.<br /><br />today i had the opportunity to view for the first time the complete three part origin episodes start to finish without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. for fans of the ranger, this is the grand daddy of all western sagas, telling as it does how texas ranger john reid survived the ambush by the butch cavendish gang, and how he was nursed back to health by an indian friend from his childhood. tonto (jay silverheels) declares his companion a 'trusty scout', and names him kemo-sabe. i've read various interpretations of the origin of the term kemo-sabe, but i'm satisfied with tonto's explanation. reading too much into it just detracts from the story, just like the english translation of 'tonto' from spanish, which i won't reveal, because it's just better not to know if you can help it.<br /><br />i thought it quite clever how the origin story created the mystique of the lone ranger, like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the rangers died in the box canyon ambush. you never see the face of the man who becomes the lone ranger, as it's always turned away or obscured to hide his real identity. even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly; the voice of the story's narrator describing the wild stallion's sterling qualities. would that relate, say, to sterling..., silver? i got the biggest kick out of that.<br /><br />of course with the passage of time, watching the lone ranger episodes today offers a view of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the origin story. some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy, particularly when it comes to a lone ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock a gun out of it's owner's hand. and how about that little wave he gives to tonto whenever they're about to ambush the bad guys - it's always the same gesture, but tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances. then you have the episodes where clayton moore takes off the ranger mask to don a different disguise to impersonate another character in service to the story. he even went under cover once as an actor portraying president abraham lincoln to uncover a villain, top hat and all!<br /><br />few fans that i come across ever know that actor john hart replaced clayton moore for the 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that moore had with the show's producers. if you ever saw that "happy days" episode where fonzie idolizes his boyhood hero, you'll notice it was john hart listed in the credits. it's difficult actually, to tell if you're watching a hart episode or not, the key is to listen to the voice; moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead giveaway.<br /><br />if you ever get the chance to sample some of the final season color episodes, you're in for a treat. the renditions i've seen on vhs are absolutely gorgeous, although i don't know if commercial prints are available. most of the black and white episodes around have been re-packaged by any number of distributors in different configurations, so getting your hands on those should be no problem. the must see of course is the three part origin, and if you don't watch anything else, this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the west's most famous heroes. hi-yo silver, awaaaay!
