i think this is a great, classic monster film for the family. the mole, what a machine! the tall creature with the beak, the flying green lizards, ranthorincus/mayas or whatever they are and the ape men things the speak telepathically with them. the battle of the men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast umm! yummy! class, what else can i say? how would they make a 2002 remake of this one?
