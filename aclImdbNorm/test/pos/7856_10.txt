this film was a surprise. the plot synopsis sounds kinky, and stars clint eastwood and the great geraldine page. i didn't know what to expect. there is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a lingering, and very adult, mouth to mouth kiss. the child takes him to the girls boarding school where she lives. he takes advantage of the situation by attempting to seduce the headmistress, played by page, her assistant and another student. jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue, and the macabre all meld in this wonderfully original story.<br /><br />i've read the other comments here and find little to disagree with. however, i wanted to clarify a point made earlier that there are no sympathetic characters in the film. i find that there is one. the attractive female slave successfully resists the soldier's advances in a scene that works well because it touches upon the common history of black women slaves taken advantage of by white men. even though her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience, she is what i would consider a sympathetic character. she, more than any of the other women and girls at the school, has a legitimate reason for participating in what happens in the end.
