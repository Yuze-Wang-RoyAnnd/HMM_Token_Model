i absolutely love this movie! evil dead has nothing on this film! night of the demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest, but this one is a classic. it's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best, but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie? stooge has some of the best one-liners to ever hit the screen in this one. (he's my favorite character) a lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the ending, sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man eats his left over halloween apples in a pie, and his throat is mangled from the inside out. the sound track is awesome. the scene with angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. the make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; angela gave me nightmares as a kid. if you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience, you might want to give this one a pass. but, if you're like me, and you really dig the whole halloween, haunted house with the demons clich'e, than this one is definitely a must own.
