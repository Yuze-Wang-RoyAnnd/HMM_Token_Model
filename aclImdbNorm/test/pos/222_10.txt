the funniest show ever on tv, albeit the humor is not for everyone. i realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer, but it's a shame only six episodes were filmed. the gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end, when you would see drebin and his boss, ed hocken, pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled, during which the criminal (still moving) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape. in another episode, the building started collapsing around them as drebin and hocken remained in freeze mode.<br /><br />leslie nielsen was comedic brilliance as frank drebin and the perfect fit for this show
