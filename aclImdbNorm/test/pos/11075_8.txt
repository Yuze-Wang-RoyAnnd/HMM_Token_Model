being from eastern pa, right on the border of northern new jersey, i still get a feeling like this was a documentary more so than a movie. i have friends from new york and new jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that "still" exists today in lower income area's outside of the "big city" lifestyle. if you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what really goes on in the urban jungle, check this movie out. no really big name actors, its as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said act, which adds to the realism of the movie, the performances are fantastic none the less! see this film!
