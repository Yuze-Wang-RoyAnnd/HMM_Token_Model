this is a film that has to be taken in context. it shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films, but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set, or at least know someone who does. and you shouldn't go in expecting blade runner; the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far, and it's a far more zany ride.<br /><br />essentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama (shot in hong kong as is obvious) about a society where it's illegal to procreate. sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive 2 and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops. takashi miike isn't one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter, but one can assume that the law on procreation (enforced by giving people the pill) is there because of over population, increased life spans and so forth. interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese, whilst sho and riki (who play their parts, as always, brilliantly) speak japanese, and a few speak english. people have criticised the english as being wooden, but i found no problems with it. also, another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive; said that takashi miike was anti-homosexual. he may very well be (and not all artists have to be left-wing), but i can't see this film as an insult to homosexuals. he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common. the film contains similar proportions of action-packed and poignant moments to doa 2, although in this film the action is more martial-arts based, and are done in a very good hong kong style. the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes, with symmetrical shots, a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look, and it's nice to see uncut, lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days. basically, there's a lot to like in this film: a good sense of humour, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. it's a great finish to the series. you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy, but isn't that part of the charm?
