this is ten times better than "who wants to be a super model" on bravo i think it is more true to the business. tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model. the photos look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure attributes, and the ability to endure and work for what they want. i enjoy seeing tyra's personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway. i don't always agree with the judges decision's or tyra's comments and at least one of the winners, i feel did not deserve to win. but this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance.
