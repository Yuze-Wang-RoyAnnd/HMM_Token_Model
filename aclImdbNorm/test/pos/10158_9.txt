i have been getting into the hitchcock series very much lately. i find myself always renting one of his movies when i'm at blockbuster or hollywood video. like i said before, hollywood is loosing it's touch incredibly, i needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there. not to mention, i want to be a film appreciator, not a movie buff. is there any better way to do that than with alfred hitchcock's movies? <br /><br />the man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller starring alfred's favorite leading man james stuart and the woman who steals the show dorris day. they play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells james some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. james seems to just doubt dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back, but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick.<br /><br />the acting again, i would say that dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast. james did a great job keeping up, together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film. i loved the little bit of comedy at the end that alfred added. you'll see what i mean. i would always highly recommend this film, despite not being the best hitchcock film, it's still a treasure.<br /><br />9/10
