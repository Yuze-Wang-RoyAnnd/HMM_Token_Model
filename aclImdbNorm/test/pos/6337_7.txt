episode no. thirteen of the fanciful (excuse the incredibly gay terminology) "supernatural" tv series relocates sam and dean winchester to missouri where they have been called upon by an old flame of dean's to investigate a string of mysterious murders occurring in their small town. as it turns out, a large pick-up truck with an unseen driver is running down african americans on a desolate stretch of road... while dean attempts to rekindle his past love affair, more towns people turn up as roadkill. the cause appears to be due to a past racial incident back in the 60s, causing a frustrated redneck spirit to remain in ghostly limbo, seeking to kill black motorists. "route 666" is another good installment (which isn't uncommon, i've noticed) which contains a few notable aspects pertaining to the pair of main characters such as dean getting laid and sam's admitted regret for having left college... the killer truck does't come across as the most terrifying thing in the world, though, for an hour long show, it does it's job well. not a hands-down fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more horror movie references.
