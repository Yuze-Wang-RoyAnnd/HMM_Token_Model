after my 6 year old daughter began taking riding lessons i started looking for horse movies for her. i had always heard of national velvet but had never seen it. boy am i glad i bought it! it's become a favorite of mine, my 6 year old and my 2 year old. it's a shame movies like this aren't made anymore.
