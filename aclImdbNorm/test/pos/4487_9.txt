during the sci-fi tz marathon of january 31, 1999, this episode was the last one aired in the 20th century in my time zone(eastern). it was new year's eve, and when the clown starts singing, "we're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're here..." i realized that this was tz's clever nod to it being new year's eve because that tune is also the tune to old lang syne. coincidence? we will never know.<br /><br />i love this story for the little touches: the tear on the ballerina, the antics of the clown, and the hit-yourself-in-the-head ending. this and the art carney santa tz are the only ones that are about christmas. <br /><br />my personal top five episodes, after five characters...: 1. the hunt 2. the after hours 3. the hitchhiker 4. the lonely 5. little girl lost
