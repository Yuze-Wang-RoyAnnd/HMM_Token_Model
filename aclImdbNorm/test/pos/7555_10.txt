a wonderful movie about people. i first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theatres and i've seen it many times since. if i'm not watching it when it's on tv, i'll get together with friends and rent it. invariably, the people i've watched this movie with find it enjoyable. it deals with friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50's and 60's. it's very funny and touching, dealing with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics- the whole 60's shebang. it can also be quite dramatic. if you enjoy movies about people, this one is definitely worth the time.
