i was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when i first saw it i was only mildly amused! i must say however, that i am still very disappointed that donald o'connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! he was an enormous talent.<br /><br />there is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and matthau has never been funnier.<br /><br />i am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see lemmon and matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. brent spiner proves that "data" from star trek the next geeration is not the only good character he can play.<br /><br />the storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and i laughed heartily throughout this movie and i highly recommend it.
