having seen other bollywood flicks with salman khan in them, i can say this is my favorite of the more recent ones. the songs are all quite fun, especially 'o priya o priya' which seems to have a nice mix of beatles, indian music and (dare i say this) a bit of prince. the love stories are a bit more believable than, say, chal mere bhai. the occasional focus on prem's use of alcohol is at times troubling as it doesn't really seem to make sense to me, but it's played well by khan--although his voice does become squeaky when he's portraying drunkenness.
