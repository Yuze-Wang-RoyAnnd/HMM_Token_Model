i have loved one true thing since the first time i watched it in the theater, and cried my eyes out. i bought it as soon as it was available, and have lost track of how many times i've watched it.<br /><br />to me one true thing is the ultimate family relationship movie. i love watching the relationships in the family change and evolve into what they end up being. i can relate to many details in the movie. my mother died of bone cancer, so it really hits home with me. maybe this is why i love it so much.<br /><br />i like the relationships between the children and their parents, and the relationship of brother and sister, but especially love the relationship between husband and wife. to me it is truly beautiful.<br /><br />i highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie.
