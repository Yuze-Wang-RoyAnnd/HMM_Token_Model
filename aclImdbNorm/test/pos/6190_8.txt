to be completely honest, i completely intrigued by the original concept of 'sleeper cell.' having watched the best part of the series on fx channel (uk), my sky got broke meaning i missed the crucial finale. but what i did see of it, i assumed it to be a great story line, good acting and as i don't watch '24' i thought it was great, and it's been confirmed for a second season...<br /><br />one of the best tv programs i have seen. much more realistic and believable than "24." excellent character development and plot line. does not bash islam, but gives a thoughtful and considered approach, showing the difference between radical terrorist islam and true islam. everybody should see this show!<br /><br />stringy xx
