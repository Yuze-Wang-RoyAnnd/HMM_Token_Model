what can i say? i couldn't sleep and i came across this movie on mtv. i started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti-drug movies do but i got sucked into this movie and i couldn't stop watching. nick stahl did an amazing job with his character, and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching. i was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie (or even the movie itself) and mtv.com was no help at all, but believe it or not amazon.com is taking pre-orders for the august 5th release of the movie on dvd. i know i had a hard time tracking it down, and i'm sure other people might have had the same problem. i'm buying my own copy so i can drool over nick stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline!
