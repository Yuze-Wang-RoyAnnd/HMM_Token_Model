yes, this is one of the greats of the black action genre. confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence (at times reaching a disturbing pitch, even for a fan of the genre) this movie isn't your shaft in the park. wonderful bits of rudy ray moore comedy stand up that don't seem funny, at least not to a white boy like me, but great in context. much better than its dissimilar sequel, "the human tornado"
