one of my favorite westerns and one of john ford's best in my opinion. no major stars, but ben johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. matching him is ward bond as the crusty mormon elder leading his people west. john ford's stock of character actors, including harry carey, jr., jane darwell, russell simpson and hank worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent james arness, a member of the outlaw clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train. the mormon trail into utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken. we can't really get the feel of that, but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west; river crossings, long stretches of dry, waterless desert, encounters with indians and the like, all set to glorious song by the sons of the pioneers. the mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels, as depicted in the movie. my main regret is that it wasn't made in color, but i believe there is a colorized version. by the way, those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the fisher towers, located near moab. highly recommended viewing.
