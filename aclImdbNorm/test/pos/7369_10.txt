this movie is about a group of four friends who wreck a car while driving. they build a campfire to get though the night and wait for help. to pass the time, they tell each other scary stories. to tell about it would ruin the movie, so rent and enjoy it!!<br /><br />i will say it starts out a little slow, but each tale get better and better. this movie stars some of today's hottest actors christine taylor(the brady bunch movies), james marsden(disturbing behavior) and ron livingston (office space). so you can see there are big name stars just not the really big ones!!go rent or buy it asap !!this movie is awesome!!
