'in the line of fire' is one of those hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit, but although i've seen it a few times, i usually end up sitting through the whole thing again. why? - it's good! clint eastwood is great as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual. the character, secret service agent frank horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect president kennedy in dallas, and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. however, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. he's charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. he's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by rene russo. the killer, played by john malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. he even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, john booth.<br /><br /> the film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. it's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it!
