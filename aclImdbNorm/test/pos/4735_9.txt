when i began watching i thought i was watching some pro-koresh amateur documentary. however, i had never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. they interviewed people saying that the fbi/atf instigated all these things, which sounded so far fetched, but then followed in up with fbi video and testimony. i was amazed. the documentary followed up with the senate investigation after the fire, and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the senate and attorney general turn their backs on davidians basically to cover up the aggression by the fbi/atf. if you start watching this you must finish it. otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that.
