this film shows up on the premium cable channels quite often and, i find that i keep watching it over and over again. the performances are wonderful, and the material has so much happening that there is always something new to take away from the film.<br /><br />maybe i am too often distracted when watching films at home, you know the drill, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn finishes during the credits. but this film is about people and what motivates us, what enlivens us, what causes rifts between us, and what inspires us.<br /><br />for me, it is films like the love letter that keep me taking a chance on new films. frankly, i am surprised that the film is not better known. i would love to see blythe danner and geraldine mcewan in many more roles. they are a delight to watch. kate capshaw is wonderful and i had no previous idea that she would be. ellen degeneres plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief.<br /><br />this film provides interesting visuals as a proper background to the characters and their interactions. i find it refreshing every time i take the time to watch it.
