this is an excellent movie. there were several parts to the movie i liked. this movie is very funny! visit the ernest fun club web site at www.ernestfunclub.com there are several movies such as the following: ernest goes to camp, ernest saves christmas, ernest goes to jail, ernest in the army, ernest goes to school, ernest rides again slam dunk ernest etc. i highly recommend these for family movies. all star jim varney again try visiting www.ernestfunclub.com which is the best ernest movie? in my opinion there are actually 2 ernest goes to camp and ernest goes to jail. so if you have never seen ernest p. worrell its time to go and see him. you will find him quite satisfactory "no what i mean"?
