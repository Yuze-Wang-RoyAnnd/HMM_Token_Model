a story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and most of all, friendship set in the very interesting time of the american civil war.<br /><br />gets you interested in history, gets you emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episode.<br /><br />moreover, the casting was splendid. many superstars appear in short cameos, the leading roles are played by a big array of talented mimes - kirstie alley and terri garber should be mentioned here - this is simply a superb example for a tv production as it should be.<br /><br />not to forget the sheer loveliness of wendy kilbourne portraying constance :-)
