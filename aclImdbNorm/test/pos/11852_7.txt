[warning: contains spoilers]<br /><br />written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky (who also directed) and maya forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory.<br /><br />jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fianc'ee wants to bed other people and he's allowed to do so, too. julianne nicholson, who was so good in "tully," plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. <br /><br />good supporting performances help immensely, too. lauren graham, who made last year's "bad santa" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, bryan cranston (the dad on tv's "malcolm in the middle") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - helen slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman.<br /><br />what surprised me most about "seeing other people" was how funny it is. there are some genuine laughs here. ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there's a m'enage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked.<br /><br />the film's premise isn't unusual, but i liked that it was alice (nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of ed (mohr). given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, alice's plan is doomed. we see how the couple works through this strange situation. initially, alice and ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it.<br /><br />i appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. yes, there's sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work here. the "other people" alice and ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. in one case, too many feelings.<br /><br />granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the richter-slater subplot isn't necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic. but that's forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where ed rummages through alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed.<br /><br />unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film.
