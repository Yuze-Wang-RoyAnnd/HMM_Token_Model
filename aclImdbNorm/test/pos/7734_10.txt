i just cannot believe the low scores for this movie. probable reason has to do with the low number of votes meaning few people have seen it. this is simply a fantastic movie! there are so many stories inter-wined within but it's not complicated. each character grows with the movie and we experience with them undergoing life changes. the scenery is simply amazing and the end credits are the best ever in any movie i have seen (just like a shakespeare play). yes, it's a little dated (filmed in 1982) but the issues the characters face are very current. it could have been filmed in 2002 without modifications to the story line. raul julia is amazing, best role ever in a movie - this is his signature piece. a young molly ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. susan sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and john cassavetes is the force that puts this all together. do yourself a favor, find this movie, view it & enjoy it. come back to imdb and score this movie into the top 250 of all time where it really belongs.
