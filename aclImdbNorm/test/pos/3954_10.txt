when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it. nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on dvd neither on blue ray. absolutely nothing!!! how it's possible this could really happen??? the direction is impeccable, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and james franco is hot as hell!!!<br /><br />please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!! this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance!!!!!! <br /><br />edvard
