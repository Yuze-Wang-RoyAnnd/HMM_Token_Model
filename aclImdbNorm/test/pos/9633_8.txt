basically, this is a very good film. it is very different from seagal's other films though, which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans. unlike some of the other films, this does not feel like a 'seagal vehicle'. you get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of mr. seagal's actions are not the same as we've seen before. the concept of him being an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change. although there are some unrealistic parts to the film (some more obvious than others), in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch.<br /><br />it boils down to this: if you are looking for a classic seagal action film, sorry, but you're going to be disappointed. watch it anyway for the fun of it. if you're open to seeing seagal without the action, it's well worth a look. i personally believe it is some of the best work he's done in quite a while.<br /><br />
