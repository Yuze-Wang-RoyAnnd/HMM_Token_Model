first, let me say that although i generally appreciate mike judge's work, i've been merely tepid in my response to office space, king of the hill, and beavis and butthead. i generally prefer more intelligent comedy, and therein lies the irony with respect to idiocracy.<br /><br />in a future world where the embodiment of beavis and butthead's views, basest instincts, and intellectual capacities are the framework of a chaotic, messy, semi-mad max semi-blade runner society, where every trailer-trash guy's fantasy becomes reality, a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay, and the mob mentality takes over. and this world is also incredibly funny.<br /><br />yes, it's obvious that carl's jr., starbucks, costco and fuddruckers executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year 2505.<br /><br />there were some missed opportunities with the film, and the relationship between the time travelers - the other being an average intelligence woman who's worried about her boyfriend's (pimp's) retribution - could have been stronger; the chemistry is there. and there don't seem to be too many women in the future.<br /><br />i did leave with a grin on my face, but the experience is a bit better than the memories. thus, it's my kind of popcorn film, and it will be fun to revisit on video. recommended! fyi stay through the credits for an extra scene.
