this movie from what i remember was such a great movie! i watched it on television when i was 11, and couldn't remember the title of it. if i remember correctly, i do believe that it was a christmas television movie special. one of my friends at work and i were discussing it several years back, but neither one of us could remember the title. but we did remember almost the entire movie. no one else at work remembered ever seeing it! thank goodness someone at a tv movie website answered my post! now i have the fun job of locating a copy of it! it's amazing what you can remember as a child, but this movie definitely remains vividly playing in my head... even after 28 years. and i do believe i only watched it once. maybe it was because i am the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because i babysat and worked in day care centers, that it stuck with me that long. regardless of the real reason, it has remained one of the movies that i have been really wanting to watch lately!!! if anyone knows where to watch it online, or has a copy, please let me know. i would so love to see it again!!!! thanks so much! seriously, i tried to post this and it says my comment isn't long enough. so, apparently i have to type more, did you know that melissa michaelsen is the sister of peter billingsley who starred in a christmas story? i know i'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea on where to find this i would greatly appreciate it.
