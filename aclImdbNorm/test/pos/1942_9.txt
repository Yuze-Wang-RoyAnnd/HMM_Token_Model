crispin glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. he gives layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. as well as feck, which role is done very well by dennis hopper. it's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult. rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers. i really enjoyed it watching. i saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like a nice 80s feel, this is the one that you have to see. i'ts a same that i didn't know of it earlier.
