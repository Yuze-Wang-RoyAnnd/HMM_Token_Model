now i like victor herbert. and i like mary martin and allan jones. but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert. walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter years<br /><br />jones and martin sing beautifully though. the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers. jones's john ramsay is a frail character, very similar to gaylord ravenal in showboat who jones also played.<br /><br />as for mary martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career. she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one. she performed well, but movie audiences didn't take to her. the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone. the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet. there's also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride.<br /><br />the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study. he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing. i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles sakall would have been a good victor herbert. sakall as irish, hello.<br /><br />nice movie, but the real vic would have been so much better.
