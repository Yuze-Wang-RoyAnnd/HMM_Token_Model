each story has a lesson for young and old. but what more i have to say may spoil a future story. but, i believe what i have to say is for everyone; just for one particular episode: the soldier and death.<br /><br />okay... of all the stories the one that sticks out for me is "the soldier and death" because is was the point in my life i realized that life was terminal. i am not kidding. the airing was on my 8 1/2 birthday... and i will always remember it. i didn't remember its title until tonight, but i new the synopsis. (may 15th, 1988)<br /><br />it is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part in life. it is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. i am living proof (currently 28 yrs old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults...<br /><br />i write this with tears in my eyes. heath ledger - a wonderful actor my own age - died today. it kinda reminded me of many lessons i have learned in my life. so i write this as a reminder to young and old... no one is immune to whatever is in store for us.<br /><br />i hate to say that death is going to happen, but this story was the first time i saw death as not a bad thing; but a part of life, was quite literally in this story. i can't help it. it was a life changing moment for me and will alway be.<br /><br />and for that...<br /><br />i love you jim henson (and i still remember much of your work in life up until the day you died, and your memorial muppet show) and thank you brian henson for keeping the workshop alive!!! honest, i do thank you, all of your co-workers, editors, and interns.<br /><br />the stage is just a stage/ and a show is just a show/ but imagination will create magic/ that forever the world will know.<br /><br />thank you!!!<br /><br />(and for all who doubt me... dance, magic dance)
