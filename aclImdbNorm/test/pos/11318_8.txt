this movie was really interesting... it also is quite shocking as the similar events of the movie occurred only 10 months after the movie premiered.<br /><br />it was interesting seeing the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you think you are - you aren't. if this was made for an american audience - it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda film and not as a wake call which the bbc did! it still is propaganda, in some extend - no film today with these themes can not be - but it dealt with the issue successfully.<br /><br />a film that should be shown in all terrorism/counter-terrorism courses but will not because it shows faults which is not allowed to be acknowledged! a great film in which the bbc took a few risks and unfortunately, london does not need a fictional tale any more, due to the reality of july 7 2005.
