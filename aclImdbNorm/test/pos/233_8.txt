i'm not a big fan of musicals, but i was always enamored of ms. hayworth's looks, so i thought i'd give it a try.<br /><br />this may be the best showcase for the multi-talented ms. hayworth. she's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of 'gilda', where she is sex symbol par excellence).<br /><br />rita is more than ably assisted by gene kelly and phil silvers. the comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing. kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.<br /><br />but rita drives this whole movie. an excellent cast, featuring otto kruger and the always- wonderful, wise-cracking eve arden doesn't hurt.<br /><br />rita sings, rita dances, all the while looking impossibly beautiful! the music may be short of classic, but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever.<br /><br />i find this movie works better than 'gilda', which i regard as a flawed film. to ms. hayworth's credit, she also drives 'gilda', and gilda drives any red-blooded male insane.<br /><br />the film holds up well after all these years. much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus!
