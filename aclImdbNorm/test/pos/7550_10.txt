unfortunately, many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores "adjusted" by imdb. this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde, little big man, night moves, mickey one, and the chase.<br /><br />if you click in the user rating area, you'll see that the actual median for four friends is 7.6. however, imdb has "adjusted" (dumbed down?) the rating to 6.4.<br /><br />per imdb: "imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages. various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at 'vote stuffing' by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it....the exact methods we use will not be disclosed. this should ensure that the policy remains effective." in other words, we won't disclose our methods, so you can't question how we arrived at the score! what a shame to see fine thought-provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb's "filters".
