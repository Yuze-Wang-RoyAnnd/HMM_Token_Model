garlin did a great job. nice concept well executed, and tightly produced. came across as a very sincere story. as a fan of "curb your enthusiasm", where jeff was pretty much the straight guy role, i was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayal.<br /><br />much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on poignancy, which i really liked, rather than being slapstick or over-explained. and there were some nice little surprises and twists. the convenience store vignettes were a delight.<br /><br />when i say it is a wonderful "small" film, i don't mean budget or quality. it is simple, intimate and hand-crafted. it tells a highly believable everyday story. relax and go see it. let it wash over you, and you will feel good for having done so.
