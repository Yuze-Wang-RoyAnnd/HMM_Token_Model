this film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive. the indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes. one major difference for this film, "only the valiant", is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline, but at the same time, deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all, even if they don't accept that charge.<br /><br />gregory peck embodies the tight-lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory. the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort; they, in turn, have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasn't taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause. eventually, the captain and the small band confront the hostiles, and at the same time, each confronts his own flaw. the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond, gig young, neville brand, lon chaney, jr., and warner anderson. <br /><br />a sleeper of a film, and a good solid western for fans of this genre.
