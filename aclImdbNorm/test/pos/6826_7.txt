i cannot understand the need to jump backwards and forwards to scene set, and pad out the plot. showing that someone has a skill right before they use it, i believe, is offending our intelligence. it's starting to feel a little contrived, and as though they are making up for being so vague for the first three series. a little disappointing this episode.<br /><br />furthermore, using past quirks, like locke's ability to know when a storm is ending, is frankly insulting... are we supposed to ooh and arr, or laugh at the softer side of locke?<br /><br />this episode was all over the place.
