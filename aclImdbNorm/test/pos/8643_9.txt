originally filmed in 1999 as a tv pilot, "mulholland dr." was rejected. the next year, david lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. he did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.<br /><br />the film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be betty (naomi watts) and rita (laura elena harring). betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. she finds rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. you see, rita's lost her memory. she has no clue who she is. she takes her name, rita, from a "gilda" poster in the bathroom. so the two set out to discover who rita really is.<br /><br />david lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. it's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. it's like a dream captured on film. by the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. having watched the movie and then read an article on the internet pointing out things in the film, i now understand the movie completely.<br /><br />the acting is very good. watts is terrific. justin theroux is very good as a hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. the music is excellent. angelo badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. and the directing - hah! david lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.<br /><br />is this your type of film? well, that depends. you should probably view more of lynch's work before watching this movie. you'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues lynch has left throughout the movie. for lynch fans, this is a dream come true.<br /><br />"mulholland dr." is a masterpiece. it's brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed. i love it.
