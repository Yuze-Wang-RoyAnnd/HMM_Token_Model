a straight-forward x file that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence. rob bowman's direction is crisp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago. david and gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage - it's a standalone x file that even non-fans could happen upon and enjoy. junior brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them, he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to. bryan cranston is intense and energetic as patrick crump, he has since admitted in interviews that he knew next to nothing about the x files prior to this role, a fact that makes his hit-the-floor-running performance all the more incredible. a brilliantly dumb episode.
