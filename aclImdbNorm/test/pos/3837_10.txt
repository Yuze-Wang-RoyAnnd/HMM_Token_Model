i really enjoyed this movie and i usually don't like animated pictures. but i thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming. there is a good song called "everybody wants to be a cat," that is a lot of fun. it has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure. i think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film.
