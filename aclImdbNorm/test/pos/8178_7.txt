the pace of the film is ponderously slow in parts, but if you can tune into its languid speed and lengthy silences then it is a satisfying piece of courtly intrigue. the story of the first emperor of china, his childhood sweetheart and the personal cost of power. the film is very atmospheric, the extremely mannered and polite courtly ceremony and ritual contrasted with sudden brutal violence. filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces. battle scenes are rare and short, the focus is on the battle within the individual on what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means. the emperor's journey from idealistic peacemaker to ruthless tyrant is aiming to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into the motivation of the emperor, indeed his actions and aims do not really change throughout, only gong li's attitudes to him are altered. the most interesting performances are gong li's and the titular assassin as they reassess when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. the most expensive film ever made in china at the time, the emperor and the assassin does not rely on hysteric emotion or big battles, but rather a brooding atmosphere of menace and inevitability. gong li fans will be unsurprised to hear she is as stunningly beautiful as ever, giving an understated performance.
