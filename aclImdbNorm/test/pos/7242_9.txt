'nemesis' was the last book to feature miss marple written by agatha christie (the official final case 'sleeping murder' was written in the forties) and i've always had a very soft spot for it. i loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent bbc adaptation with joan hickson, terrific as ever, as miss marple.<br /><br />on the whole it is very faithful to the book. a few characters are dropped, the first (new) murder is slightly different and a couple of new characters are introduced. personally i felt that the added character of lionel peel was unnecessary and rather irritating. tour guide madge was irritating in a different way but often quite amusing. it's largely because of lionel that i don't award 10 out of 10! the other characters are beautifully done especially helen cherry as a dignified miss temple and all of the three weird sisters but particularly margaret tyzack who gives a towering performance as clothilde. she threatens to go over the top towards the end but just avoids it. the female bodyguards are good value too and the episode contains one of my favourite hickson lines...'an archdeacon?!' <br /><br />this is another relatively early bbc marple that looks wonderful and is has a gloriously nostalgic feel to it. highly recommended.
