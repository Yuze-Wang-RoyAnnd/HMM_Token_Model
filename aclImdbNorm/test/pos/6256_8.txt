okay, this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life. despite the fact that it's lower budget, it's a pretty decent movie, though. the monsters are unique and believable. heck, they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family. although, when you finally do get to see the monsters completely, you really think "wtf!? those itty bitty things are after them?!" the only part that really disturbed me is when *sniff* they killed the kitty! not the kitty, noooooo, why? seriously though, if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore, this is not the movie for you. go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines. if you have small children, i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room.
