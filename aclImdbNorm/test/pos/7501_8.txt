this movie has some of the best dialogue ever written. the really good lines are all given to george c. scott, a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue. i just saw this movie again, for the first time in 20+ years, and the dialogue is as good as ever. the bizarre goings-on at the hospital are so imaginative as to dazzle you. they frequently involve such marvelous poetic justice as to be near strokes of genius. i love this movie!!
