i've loved this movie since i was a little kid. i remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me. i loved it and i still do. i think it's very funny and original. there are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. lou is also a surprisingly good singer. the actors that portray prince arthur and princess eloise are okay too, but abbott and costello are the best. former heavyweight boxing sensation buddy baer, also brother of former heavyweight champion max baer is good in this movie as the cop and the giant. he's a better actor than boxer. he had a natural talent. the beginning of this movie is hilarious how lou costello keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with buddy baer. the slapstick in the house is good too. i especially like the comedy in the giant's castle. my favorite parts are; the part were lou is climbing the beanstalk and they're all singing as a farewell. jack is singing back to them that he'll return. lou costello is a very good at singing. my other favorite part is the part when jack is fighting with the giant. i like when jack makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the giant an omelet they keep exploding. abbott and costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time. this is only one of their great movies that i will love and cherish. the reviews for this movie aren't very good and i can't understand why. this is a very good abbott and costello movie. i also love how lou costello comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when bud hits him. he starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around. very good movie.
