i was looking in the tv guide for movies that come from germany and i found one called the bunnyguards, so i watched it and i laughed myself silly! i wanted the dvd but its not available here (i could order it from germany but it doesn't have subtitles) it was played again so i taped it and watch it from time to time.<br /><br />anyway, i looked for info on it and found out its real name is erkan & stefan, but i know it by its australian title: the bunnyguards.<br /><br />some people who i know from germany do not like erkan & stefan because of their accents, but not being german myself, i didn't notice anything. the jokes are good, but some germans might find their accents off-putting.<br /><br />i think this movie is funny and if the dvd had english subtitles on all the extras (having a 2 disk edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad) i would buy it up in a snap!<br /><br />i recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.
