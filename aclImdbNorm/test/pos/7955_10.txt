this film would have put the typical hollywood "tearjerkers" to shame. the emotions portrayed are subdued and understated in a very comfortable fashion. the plot is cliche enough with a lead role having terminal disease (this is not a spoiler and was well established quite early into the movie) the method of execution is somehow unique from most love stories you ever saw--not even a kiss was being exchanged and yet you will feel the enormous current of love between the two leads. initially, i assumed this "restriction on emotions" to be something analoguous to the typical "eastern values" but later decided against it.<br /><br />this film is so understated that if you compare it with movies like "cinema paradiso", cp would have felt overtly manipulative by comparison. so, it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea.<br /><br />after watching the film, i have this strong feeling that holly- wood love movies, (or love movies all around, to be accurate) have been glorifying romance or passion and label it as "love". i am sure we all have our own definitions and i wouldn't say these qualities are mutually exclusive. but, i would venture to say that the movie will let you wonder if there is any added dimension you have with you loved one.<br /><br />it's very obvious that i enjoy this movie a lot. considering the fact that the movie is so plain in appearance, it is paradoxically one of the more "cinematic" movie i saw lately.
