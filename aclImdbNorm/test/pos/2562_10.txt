initially i was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the dvd. in fact, this held true with friends of mine who didn't rent it due to the art and the mental image(s) it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me (or to my friends). but, i rented and watched it and was truly amazed.<br /><br />i agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual inferences, so it is definitely not something i'd want young children to watch (and doubt seriously if they would understand it anyway).<br /><br />i enjoy movies like this whereby the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a no-nonsense, direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad. the acting done ... was it acting? ricci and jackson performed so well, i was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting. same thing with the story ... may seem far-fetched somewhat, but it was done so very, very well. it reminded me of another movie with mel gibson, tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so were well-defined.<br /><br />i found much depth in this movie with the character's involved, so feel that everyone involved (from the cameramen to the actors) should be commended on a perfect fit/result. after viewing this movie, i had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like i did, so after hearing my comments, they rented and watched it. they, too, were quite surprised at how good it was. it is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off. i can see now how the art applies, but i'd not heard of this movie before, and the art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys dvd sales/rentals.<br /><br />these characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the "feel" for each. i felt i could trust the movie to flow well, and it did. so, with the jacket art aside, i would recommend watching this movie.
