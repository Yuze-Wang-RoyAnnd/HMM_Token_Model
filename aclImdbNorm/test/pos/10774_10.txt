this film is totally mindblowing. it manages to be thought provoking, funny, tragic, and cinematic yet claustrophobic.<br /><br />although the flashbacks are unnecessary, the film maintains a pacy, punchy grip and the performances are all excellent, in particular alec baldwin, and the mesmerising eric bogosian as the film's anti-hero, barry champlain.
