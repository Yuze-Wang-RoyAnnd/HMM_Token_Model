the movie "everything is illuminated" comes from first-time writer-director liev schreiber, adapting jonathan safran foer's first novel. the book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen. the movie, wisely, attempts less. while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it's still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip, or, as one of the characters would have it, "a very rigid search."<br /><br />that character is alex (eugene hutz), a young ukrainian man who loves american pop culture but can't seem to get the english language straight. nevertheless, his grandfather (russian actor boris leskin), who runs a tour company catering to american jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for jonathan (elijah wood). jonathan is investigating his family history, and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis. more than one family secret gets revealed during their quest.<br /><br />the movie's jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi- kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother's dentures to add to his collection of "family things". wood's quiet, wide-eyed, earnest manner works very well in this role. hutz makes an impressive debut as the loose-limbed, easygoing alex. his malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to pull off the character's growing self-awareness. the dog mikki is very funny as the demented sammy davis jr. jr., and one of the few movie dogs i've ever seen that isn't cloyingly cute and precocious.<br /><br />"everything is illuminated" eventually puts the holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of specific, small tragedies. reminiscent of a european movie, it also ponders the effect of past events on present-day young people like jonathan and alex. with its original perspective, strong performances and some very striking visuals, "everything is illuminated" is great work for a first-timer, and hopefully schreiber will continue to direct movies.
