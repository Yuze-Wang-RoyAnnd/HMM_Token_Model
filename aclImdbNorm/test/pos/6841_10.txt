emma thompson, alan rickman,carla gugino and gil bellows are a delight in this sexy caper. this film is smart, edge of your seat entertainment for adults, and what a relief that is in these days of big concept predictable cartoons. great music and camera work add to the fun that is this new orleans-set puzzle. highly recommended. ten stars!
