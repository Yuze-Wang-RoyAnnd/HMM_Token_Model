this movie rocked!!!! saw it at a screener a coupla weeks ago. kinda a strange story, where james franco plays this jerk who marries sienna miller just to get out of the country and they go to niagara falls for their honeymoon. don't wanna give it away cuz the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens. i kinda thought i would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which i like a lot. the acting is really good and sienna miller is totally smokin' and plays this really sweet girl. i think she should do more roles like this. james plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good. david carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. i gave this movie a 10 because i came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which i didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date flick
