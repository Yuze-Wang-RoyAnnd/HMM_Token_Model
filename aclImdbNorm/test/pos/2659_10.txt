like a circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering. or not, depending on the audience.<br /><br />a monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement. if one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made.<br /><br />
