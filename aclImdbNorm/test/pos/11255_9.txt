spoiler begin the movie focuses on three friends, samantha (summer phoenix), chris (nick stahl), and owen (aaron paul). the movie starts out with sam and owen as the drug addicts, and chris, the track star, as the one who takes care of them. as things get increasingly worse at home for chris, he asks sam what the drug is like. sam is out of rehab and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better. chris then catches up with owen and they start using. it takes chris two times till he is a " full time member". after some trouble with a dealer and a confession to sam, she gets in again. so begins the downward spiral for them. chris od's when he breaks a promise to sam (i want some of the movie to be a surprise). he dies, sam gets in to college to be an architect, and owen gets arrested. so ends the story<br /><br />spoiler ends. minor spoilers throughout<br /><br />nick stahl is amazing. he will have an oscar one day. his portrayal of chris was heartbreaking. he was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes. aaron paul who played owen acted as if he were on speed not heroin. summer phoenix was fine, she is talented but what can i say nick stahl stole the movie. his drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /><br />the writers needed to show withdrawls in the movie. that is a main reason why people don't want to quit. other then that there are hilarious scenes (the mall scene, and the backstreet boy scene,man stahl nailed the reactions right on the head.), touching, sad scenes (like the scene between sam and chris in her bedroom after he gets beat up, i bawled, and the park scene.). it was realistic too. like s am using again when chris wanted to flush the drug down the toilet, and chris using again after he goes to own's, even though he had been clean for two weeks, the pull was too strong. it is all realistic. <br /><br />watch the movie for a great cast, great music, and a semi- truthful account of drug addiction.
