i love those kind of movies. blood, revenge, a lot of action, very dark, cheesy and more. but this one doesn't deliver the genre that you might expect. when i saw kite birds and ichi the killer before, i had fun watching those but why this one not? dead or alive: final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't even expect nudity in this movie.at least add some more action to entertain the audience. even the drama wasn't that good. well, i don't want to spoil the movie nor the plot.but i felt that dead or alive: final is a bit nerdy. so, without further to do. i don't recommend this movie to everyone but i recommend for the people who love decent and well directed anime.<br /><br />dr jacques coulardeau, university of paris dauphine & university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
