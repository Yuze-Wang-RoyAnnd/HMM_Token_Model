this film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. this is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and "man of the house". it could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. it touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. i laughed, i cried, i couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really? especially a documentary. this is an excellent film and one that i highly recommended to anyone who enjoys documentaries, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, soul searching, yearning, wandering through life and finding your way, or not.
