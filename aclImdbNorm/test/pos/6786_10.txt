i just wanted to say that i am watching national velvet on tv, it is now feb 2006 and i was checking on dates details, etc. surprising to see it was made in 1944 and rooney was 24 years old whilst liz taylor only 12, what an accomplished english actress she is.<br /><br />to put some americans contributors right: there are no irish villages in england. ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the english countryside. the scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of england between brighton and arundel (county of sussex). no such scene exists now unfortunately. like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches.<br /><br />so please, all you lovely americans, do not confuse ireland with england, ever! we take great exception to it. like confusing texas with coney island.
