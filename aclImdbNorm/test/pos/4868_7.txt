chuck jones's 'beep beep' (so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says "meep meep") is the second of the exceptionally popular road runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but lacklustre 'fast and furry-ous'. while it features several predictable quickfire gags, 'beep beep' also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. chief among these is a fantastic, extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small lights. there's also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket-powered roller-skates. 'beep beep' also sees a great improvement in the representation of wile e. coyote. not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in 'fast and furry-ous' but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain. although it's a little slow to get going (too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags), once 'beep beep' arrives at the mine shaft sequence it's clear that jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them. there are better road runner cartoons than 'beep beep' but there's a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario.
