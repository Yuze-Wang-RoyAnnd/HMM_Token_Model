star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />one time heroin addict frankie machine (frank sinatra) gets out of prison to his bumbling jailbird partner sparrow (arnold stang), needy cripple of a wife zosch (eleanor parker) and bit on the side molly (kim novak.) he's trying to make it big as a drummer in a band, but until his big break comes along he's stuck doing the only other thing he was any good at other than being a junkie- dealing cards in high stakes games. and try as he might, even prison hasn't cured him of his addiction to the devil's drug- causing him to lie to and deceive all those around him and driving him to desperate measures to feed his habit. his yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending.<br /><br />when people think of frank sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like under my skin, new york new york and it had to be you. but lest anyone forget he was actually a renowned actor too and, if his performance in the acclaimed from here to eternity wasn't enough, he will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama, dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse.<br /><br />the film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use (probably the reason behind the 15 certificate) in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground. in his portrayal of the main protagonist, sinatra is fine, perfectly conveying the despair, desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to him. his cold turkey scene is much more intense than ewan mcgregor's in trainspotting. the first co-star to make an impression is parker as machine's demanding, needy cripple of a wife, using her husband's guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can. novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than parker. stang does his usual comic relief thing, as the bumbling sidekick who trails the leading man around with his waspy new york accent.<br /><br />director otto preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so powerfully to life. ****
