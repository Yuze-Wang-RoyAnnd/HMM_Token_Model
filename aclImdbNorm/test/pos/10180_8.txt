when one watches the animated superman shorts of the 1940s, the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring - the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarter, threatening metropolis with some evil invention - death rays, mechanical monsters, electric earthquake, magnetic telescope, what have you.<br /><br />this one is refreshingly different. the bad ones drive around in a car, shooting and bombing, but the center of action is the gold train (on which lois lane travels, as the only press reporter, it seems). train movies have their own typical ingredients, from the 1903 great train robbery on, and quite some are featured here: decoupling cars in motion, running on the roofs, taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back, fighting with the engineer, a switch turned to deroute the train on a side track, the fall (of people or the whole train) from a high bridge... it's all in the few minutes of this lovely piece.<br /><br />but it wouldn't be a superman film if he didn't do some incredible feats (involving balancing and high-precision placement) to ultimately win the day. if you're a fan of train movies, don't miss this. it's in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive.org.
