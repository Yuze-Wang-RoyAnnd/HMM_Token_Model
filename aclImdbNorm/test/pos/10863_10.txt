tipping the velvet has just three weeks ago been released in the uk and already i watch as countless letters flood to the national papers and tv guides, claiming that it possesses a thin plot, weak performances and an even weaker script.<br /><br />you find me incensed. this is heresy.<br /><br />i would really like to dispel all doubt by first congratulating andrew davies on enabling geoffrey sax to create this wonderful dramatization of sarah waters' novel by cushioning him with such a fantastic script. kudos. but i fear i must now change tack.<br /><br />i saw one of the premiere tv guides here in the uk (which shall remain nameless) relentlessly describing tipping the velvet as a "lesbian love story". if they are, and i assume they are, trying to promote interest in the film, then this is completely the wrong way to go about it (aside from the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description). by saying such a thing, they are either a) turning away those who would instinctively be repelled by "that" subject matter or b) attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some "serious girl-on-girl action". buy a video! through this display of serious inconsideration, this and other magazines are cheapening what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent literature's greatest works. tipping the velvet is a story of love, of passion, of moving on, of loss, and of heartbreak. it's not a lesbian love story. no siree.<br /><br />the end result is a stylish affair, with excellent performances all round (particularly from stirling, hawes, chancellor and may). direction-wise, it's intoxicating and immersive - sometimes, fast-paced, sometimes not - but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling. as a whole, it's polished and well delivered, the sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy - and although many will not class it as a real "film", it will remain among my favourites for some time to come.
