this was a very funny, fast paced movie. i watched it more than once and am keeping my rental around to show others. i'd just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone in the know, how do hk producers choose their subtitle translators? i'm most curious. please direct me. <br /><br />again, to return to review, it is a really rollicking film with plenty of content, subtleties reminiscent of the classics, though full of slapstick. reminiscent, say, of the mexican comedies of cantinflas.<br /><br />the film does not disappoint fans of the director who have noticed that he chooses distinctly chinese themes, trying to get to characteristics rarely explored. the director's entire collection is way of getting a look inside the culture in a disarming way.<br /><br />and i don't see how his funny girl in chinese feast could be topped.
