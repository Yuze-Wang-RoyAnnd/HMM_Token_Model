this is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you. the makings of a real cult classic. it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. a beautiful girl, a hero, the buffoon, a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers. this one is full of blood,guts and gore. i strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours, and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of monster trucks, bad {but funny } one liners and our hero eating eye ball stew. not as good as the evil dead but a close second. just remember warning..... do not eat before viewing this film...
