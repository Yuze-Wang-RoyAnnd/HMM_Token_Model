i saw this at the san francisco independent film festival and liked it a lot. it worked for me as a slightly weird comedy, because i don't like horror, but there were only a couple of minutes i had to close my eyes.<br /><br />the dialog was good, the costumes and settings were not far off bbc-quality, which is amazing for an indie film. i liked the way the plot twists and even meanders, it kept surprising me in good ways. i even warmed up to the willy grimes character, who i quite disliked at the beginning. it would have been better if there'd been any motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island: that felt very much like a plot device.<br /><br />i am fond of dominic monaghan, and he did a good job at pratfalls, horror, and at the more thoughtful moments. nice voice in the narration, too.<br /><br />this would be a fun and unusual date movie.
