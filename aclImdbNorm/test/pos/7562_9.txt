i haven't seen this film for over 20 years, but it had such an impact on me that i remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after in complete awe. this is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. i just ordered a copy of it on dvd and paid for overnight shipping and can't wait for it to arrive. it is uplifting at times, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. it's a story of a close-knit band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the sidelines, rather than watching on a movie screen or television. hard to explain, but it is something that must be experienced. the story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life. the entire cast did an incredible job and it's by far the best work of jodi thelen's career. i'm hoping that the dvd lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this friday with a good friend.
