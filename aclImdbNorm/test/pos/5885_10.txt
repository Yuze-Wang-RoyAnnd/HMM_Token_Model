the movie features another exceptional collaboration between director william wyler and cinematographer gregg toland, the first after toland worked on citizen kane. but the talent of both these men was focused on achieving a perfectly crafted movie, understood in the good old american sense as a great story. the technical aspects of the movie are covered so as the viewer gets absorbed into the action that takes place on the screen without submitting to the power of the image. technique is seen as a vehicle of representation unlike in citizen kane where welles' baroque style almost drew the attention from the story to the way the story was told. one of my favorite moves with deep focus in this film is the drama conveyed by the returning home welcoming of homer and al. if homer's girl, wilma comes towards him perfectly in focus, al goes over to his wife also perfectly in focus. this is a brilliant move because it shows only through the use of the image the nature of these relationships as we will see them throughout the movie: wilma loves homer and she accepts him as he is, al's wife loves him also but she feels unprepared to fully welcome him home. also later in the film we find out that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses.<br /><br />wyler is a director whose force lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to boast. he wanted to show his audience how hard it was for the american soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that either didn't understand them or treated them with contempt. with a perfect cast and great dialogue goldwin and wyler produced a movie that will forever be the template for any other returning home movie. the three hours which coincide with the "rough cut" because the test audience back then never felt for a moment that the action was slow and indeed every scene from the film seems perfectly justified. the whole thing is constructed beautifully, every character gets a fair amount of exposure, nothing is left to chance and it is quite pitiful that hollywood nowadays never manages to bring so much character conflict to the screen. tbyool explores the depth of the american way of life, of the american family and society to an extent that makes other movies look like "the children's hour".
