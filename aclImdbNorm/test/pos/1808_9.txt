valley girl is the definitive 1980's movie with catch phrases filtered throughout this wonderfully acted movie. the characters are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual "day-in-the-life" of any high school, usa. this flick is to the 1980's what the brady bunch tv series is to the 1970's. if you don't like it, well then "gag me with a spoon."
