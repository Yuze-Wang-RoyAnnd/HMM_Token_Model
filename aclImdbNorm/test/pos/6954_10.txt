i'm not sure how the imdb "weighted average" came up with such a low rating on this film. it is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie. rip torn is fantastic as the stubborn noel lord, and tantoo cardinal superlative as his housemate. torn and cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft on.<br /><br />their relationship isn't always pleasant, but it's very real. this is not the "humerous and touching love story" it's billed as on the dvd jacket. in the end it is a tragedy. lord simply aims too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to move.<br /><br />the music is fantastic, as are the period sets.
