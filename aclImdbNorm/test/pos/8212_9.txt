when this movie firt came out in 1995, i found it amazingly great. especially with sandra bullock.after having watched her brilliant performance in speed , i was ready to enjoy any of her movies.<br /><br />back to the net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspence.all in all, i enjoyed it so i give it a **** out of *****.
