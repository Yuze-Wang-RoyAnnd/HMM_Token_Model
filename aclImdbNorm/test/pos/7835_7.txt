let's get one thing straight, this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun'd by everyone else. <br /><br />i went in with one promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and it delivers! <br /><br />the gore itself is really good, and the characters have awesome roles. come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs, even a electrical engineer getting his pimp on! you get to see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore, and a mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face!! as i mentioned and many others have, the movie pacing is a bit off, but respectable nonetheless. <br /><br />movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this. there can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /><br />it could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as alien lock-down or boa vs python, but those are some big shoes to fill. <br /><br />a solid 7 out of 10.
