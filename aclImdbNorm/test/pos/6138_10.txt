i watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it. i was very intriguing and suspenseful. it is amazing as the events unfold and this man's past catches up with him.<br /><br />the acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims... "twist of fate"... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie.
