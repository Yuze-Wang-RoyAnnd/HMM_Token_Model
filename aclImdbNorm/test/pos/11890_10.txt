i have seen this film more then once. actually el padrino was one of the best feature films that i have seen in a great deal of time.<br /><br />there was a big cast jennifer tilly, faye duanway, brad dourif, and damian chapa who really shined like a real star in this part of kilo.<br /><br />i heard this film was shot for under two million dollars. i have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value.<br /><br />damian chapa why are you not getting offers and more film work!!! excellent job!!!!!!!!!! i cant wait to see the sequel, and i hope it has the same action.<br /><br />jennifer tilly has made a cult classic character with sabeva.<br /><br />damian chapa moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40's and 50's so sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like ben stiller getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show. a great film.<br /><br />go go go kick some but in sales el padrino!!!
