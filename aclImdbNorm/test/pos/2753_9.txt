the show is great. no words to describe it. wonderful music. incredible dance. the editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.<br /><br />the editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. it's ok to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average... they manage to film the start of a jump with one camera, then cut it in the middle, and show the rest of it in another angle.<br /><br />no matter how much they tried, they couldn't spoil that wonderful show. it's a must for dance and music lovers.
