i just want to say that i was thrilled to find these comments about the show. i have tried online searches for info about the show in the past with no luck. i loved the show. i have a hard time getting motivated to exercise but this show made it fun. as another comment mentioned that it wasn't so complicated as the routines nowadays. it was an ideal workout that got the job done! i would give anything to be able to buy a copy of just one workout. i remember many of the moves but not nearly all of it. somebody please try to get it back on the air and also make it available on dvd. it is so great to know i wasn't the only one that loved that show! thanks for making my day!
