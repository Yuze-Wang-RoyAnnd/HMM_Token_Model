if you like madonna or not, this movie is hilarious!! i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release. however, over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun. sure there are some bad lines & cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast. she is cute,funny, and is the only comedic role of her movie career. madonna usually just plays 'herself' in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film, she really seems like somebody else for once. of course the film is directed by james foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting 'at close range' with sean penn & christopher walken) and co-stars griffin dunn ('after hours') who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material. the story is nothing genius and don't expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80's romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see. the soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 madonna songs: the #1 hit "who's that girl", the #2 hit "causing a commotion" and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads "the look of love''(top 10 hit in the uk) and "can't stop" a left over pop ditty from the 'true blue' sessions the year before. it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd.
