this movie has everything going for it: fully developed characters, a realistic portrayal of working washington, bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely albert brooks. the dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987. remember, this was pre-cable! so satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals -- and it all moves along with lightning speed. such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance. see if you can spot john cusack as the angry messenger! and do you recognize peter hackes from real life broadcast news? finally, if you're from dc, see if you agree with holly hunter's directions to cab drivers!
