i remember watching this film in 1981, when i was 7. it was absolutely brilliant! i found the dvd just a couple of months ago. i was nearly jumping up and down with glee!! i bought it and showed it to my kids. they loved it too. they asked what words the seahorse was singing (i didn't tell them, though, because i don't think telling the words 'gay' and 'ecstasy' to 6 year old kids is very good parenting). the songs are brilliant. i still remember them all. i'll still remember them when i'm 60! there, or near abouts. tommy pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. it's a pity he gave it up.<br /><br />if you find the film, buy it! you'll love it!
