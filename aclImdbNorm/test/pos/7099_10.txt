this movie has the look and feel of having been put together in a matter of days-kind of like plan 9 from outer space. in spite of this, it's still a classic-ranking among my favorite creature features. *****possible spoilers ahead******* count dracula and larry talbot; aka wolfman, arrive at the laboratory of dr. edelman seeking a cure for their nocturnal anti-social behavior, such as killing people. in the meantime, kindly dr. edelman discovers the body of the frankenstein monster. becoming obsessed with bringing it back to life( a common character trait among scientists, mad or otherwise), he goes against his better judgement, resulting in monster mayhem and madness. one of the final universal classics of it's time (abbot and costello meet frankenstein followed 3 years later), it rates a 10 with this reviewer. onslow steven steals the show as good doctor gone bad after being infected by the blood of dracula and becoming a half- werewolf/vampire creature, coming to a tragic end. at 1 hour 7 min. it packs quite a punch. a worthy addition to my video collection.<br /><br />rating: ***** out of *****
