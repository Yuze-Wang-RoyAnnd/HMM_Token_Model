this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full, the first was rope, which i really enjoyed. with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas rope took place all in one room. i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.<br /><br />it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. as a thriller, i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states. the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. the sound design is almost non existent. you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.<br /><br />the film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.<br /><br />the performances are there, but nothing amazing. everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. the one stand out is otto kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.<br /><br />in the end, i wanted more from this one. i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films, but i did have a good time watching it. i can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.
