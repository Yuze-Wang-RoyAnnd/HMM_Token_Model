the first time i saw this movie, it didn't seem to go anywhere. when i watched it a second time though, it made a lot more sense. give it a chance, watch it more than once, there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it. the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline. the combination of clooney's leading role blends well with turturro and nelson's supporting acts. john goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. the soundtrack is great as well. this movie has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.
