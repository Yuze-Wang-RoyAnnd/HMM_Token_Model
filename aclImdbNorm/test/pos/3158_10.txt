i like movies that show real people "americans" and tell truth. the movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. it played here in norway fine (amazon says above that it's usa/canda but the box states "all regions". i have to say it is not for the american viewers. it played in here in world raw views, a theater. i saw it and later i ordered it. the cut was different and much better. see it and you will like it or maybe hate it. sorry bush lovers but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense. get angry and hate it. disagree with everything in it but i for one stand by it. it's not for the empty minds. it is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense. i loved owen's words and the poem made me cry.
