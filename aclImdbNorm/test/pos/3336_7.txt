this is a better-than-average entry in the saint series - it holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.<br /><br />many films from the golden age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. they date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. who nowadays asks for a highball? or wears a suit and tie everywhere? and the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. frankly, much of value is missing from those days.<br /><br />in any case, go with it and enjoy. it's good - in an old-fashioned sense.
