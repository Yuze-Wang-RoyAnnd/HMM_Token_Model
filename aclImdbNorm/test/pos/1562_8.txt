judith ivey as the scamming old whore is awesome. emily grace the young girl. is innocent and exciting as she learns whats going down. excellent direction and camera. story is dark and disturbing.supporting cast is good. shows what happens and can happen with a run of bad luck. great independent film. small cast. pace is slow at first and then moves good. a good movie to show your teen age daughter who has aspirations of leaving home early, for the open road and adventure. this movie, film has a low budget feel to it, but it works because of the low lifes and areas that these people move in. i will never stop a rest stop again with out thinking of this movie and checking my tires before i go.
