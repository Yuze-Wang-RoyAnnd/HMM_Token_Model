i didn't catch gilmore girls when it first came out, so still doing some catch-up on the first season. i read through most of the users comments and for the negative ones, i have to ask, what show are you watching??<br /><br />this show is a classic, great lines, characters and good acting. and best of all, not your standard formula show always with an occasional twist to the story. there are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the lorelai/emily relationship then in the lorelai/rory relationship. the people and storylines are not pc but they are real!!<br /><br />if you find the dialogue annoying, i suggest you tape the show, so you can rewatch the parts don't understand.
