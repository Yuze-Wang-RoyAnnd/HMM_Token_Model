"house calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they used to make them." it stars walter matthau (in one of his best roles) as a recently widowed doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits paydirt as he seems to have a different woman every night. he then meets hospital patient glenda jackson and soon develops a relationship with her. but it's one that will be severely tested as she informs him she is a one man woman and expects him to be a one woman man.<br /><br />this is a sweet, very funny film also starring art carney as the senile hospital administrator and richard benjamin as matthau's friend and fellow doctor. it's a must see for any matthau fan or any fan of light comedy.<br /><br />you won't be disappointed.
