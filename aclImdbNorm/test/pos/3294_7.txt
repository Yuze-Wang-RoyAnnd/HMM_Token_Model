director: tay garnett, ford beebe, cast: mike mazurki, vic christy, fritz ford, tay garnett.<br /><br />based on the number of comments i see on imdb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. this seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that i remember. my mom took me and my little brother to see this film at the garland theater in spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and i still remember it.<br /><br />i am going by memory here but i believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him. i believe it to be set in 1800's alaska. a narrator tells the story of the trapper played by mike mazurki. really, this is a very good film with a great setting. it could be compared to the 1981 film death hunt with charles bronson. the two films have a very similar story line. the main difference between the two is death hunt is an adult orientated film whereas challenge is a family friendly film. <br /><br />mike mazurki and tay garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which i find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of alaska. this was the last film made by tay garnett before he died which was just a few years later. they both had been around since the silent era.
