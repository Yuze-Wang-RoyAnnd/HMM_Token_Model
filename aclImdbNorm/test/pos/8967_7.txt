mike nichols' film "charlie wilson's war", set in the 1980's, tells the story of how the title character (played by tom hanks) managed to wage a covert war with the russkies by way of aiding the afghan forces. of course, we know how well that turned out in the long run but, thankfully, the film does not gloss over the unpleasant after-effects.<br /><br />the cast is star-studded, with tom hanks and julia roberts being among the most bankable stars in hollywood. as a bonus, you've got the versatile philip seymour hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, one for which he received a not unwarranted oscar nomination. i'm not much of a fan of roberts but hanks is always dependable. nevertheless, i can't quite buy into him as a drug-using womanizer, although the real charlie wilson seems just as eminently likable as hanks. apart from the big three, though, there's not much worth remarking on, even from a recognizable name like amy adams.<br /><br />the story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from aaron sorkin. the verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines. the later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the bookending scenes honoring wilson seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended. on the whole, nichols' direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably.<br /><br />this is a film that, like charlie wilson himself, has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly likable. certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light-hearted feel.
