i very much enjoyed this movie and i think most fans of lauren ambrose will too. her character is much softer than her role in six feet under and all of the performances are strong. i especially enjoyed the way the role of emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without clich'e by the actress, taylor roberts. also a standout was fran kranz, whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script. what maybe worked well as a stage-play didn't hold out quite so well on screen. however the lovely cinematography by paul ryan definitely makes up for that, as well as the pace of the film, which is surprisingly not slow. i recommend this movie to fans of six feet under and also fans of plain good acting and cinematography.
