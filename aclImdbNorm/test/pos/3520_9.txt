just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. the backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like friday the 13th, the burning, and madman. just before dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. the cinematography is gorgeous. the acting is top notch. the heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.<br /><br />constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in. there's a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality - coinciding that alongside her will to survive.<br /><br />just before dawn isn't for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as close to perfect as you can get. the killer(s) are very menacing - almost like it's a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory. the end scene is a bit off kilter. for the first time viewer, it may be a little shocking. i'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher. even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it. the setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy. the death sequences aren't particularly gory, but i'm not sure the film needed gore. see it!
