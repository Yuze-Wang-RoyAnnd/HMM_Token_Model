wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen.<br /><br />the shift from the early days as a new-york based black-american phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture (and largely west coast-based) is profiled well.<br /><br />the humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. these djs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables.<br /><br />dj qbert's comment that he pictures what "music" must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out, seemingly silly at first, makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create!<br /><br />some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip-hop culture. one film at a time people!
