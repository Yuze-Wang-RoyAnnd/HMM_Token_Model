i think that just sums up this film. watch it and you'll find out why. the acting of the lead character john keem is really, really bad and he has no on screen charisma whatsoever. it's very funny because of this thought, as is the ending where keem beheads the bad guy despite the fact he is unarmed and has surrendered. brilliant!
