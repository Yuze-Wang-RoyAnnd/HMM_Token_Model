great movie! chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. jennifer tilly (tiffany) makes this movie even better! well before chucky died tiffany and him were together. but like ten years later tiffany gets chucky back (as a doll) and brings him back to life. it was a great movie!scary and definetly funny (only because chucky!)10/10
