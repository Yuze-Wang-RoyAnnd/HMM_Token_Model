this was a nice film. it had a interesting storyline, that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film. the storyline kinda reminded me of the city of god. but this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison. it had what i really loved:a tinge of surrealism. some pretty interesting cinematography (thru the wooden camera) i'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it definitely widens you're view of south africa. the actors were good (for 1st timers, most of them anyway), i especially liked estelle character, which made this movie pretty enjoyable. what is interesting though, was that it makes you ask about your own life. are you really doing what you really love? or do you consent to the norm, the conventionalism around you. definitely worth a watch.
