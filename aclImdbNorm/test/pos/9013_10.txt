original movie lovers can actually love this show, if they just stop complaining all the time.<br /><br />the emperor's new school brings up some old jokes from the movie, like pulling the lever to yzma's lab and kuzco pausing the episode. but since it's a kids show, it's just classic and is in their right places. even though the style is much more simple, the animation and characters keeps their personalities very well and it surprised me, actually. eartha kitt makes excellent voice acting for yzma and j.p manoux does a wonderful job for kuzco's voice instead of david spade, who played kuzco in the movie. great plots, hilarious moments and kuzco's amazing looks makes this show worth watching. (just stop complaining about everything!)
