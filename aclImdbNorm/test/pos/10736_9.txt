i think not! i mean yeah if you compare this film to the godfather, or maybe a little older film like casablanca, or maybe even a little newer film like the english patient. it doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie, or does it? i think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. in the categories best picture, best actor in a leading role and best actress in a supporting role, this film really deserved all of them. the magnificent dustin hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. a couple of times in this movie i forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! i have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. so dustin hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. there are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: katherine hepburn, meryl streep, jane fonda and ingrid bergman (i can't help it, i think she's great). meryl streep, even though she's in a supporting role, is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real. wow, that's all i can say. justin henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful, so i say good job to cute little justin henry. <br /><br />while i was watching this film for like the third time, alone, i couldn't stop crying. i tried but i couldn't. thank god i was alone! this is probably the purest film i have ever seen. other films that were nominated for best picture was apocalypse now, norma rae, breaking away and all that jazz. i'm ashamed, cause i haven't seen any of them, but from what i've heard, apocalypse now is great but when i heard about norma rae i only thought of sally field. i think that considering the other nominees, this film deserved it's five oscars, and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just like it has for the past 28 years. good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget.<br /><br />thanks for your time.
