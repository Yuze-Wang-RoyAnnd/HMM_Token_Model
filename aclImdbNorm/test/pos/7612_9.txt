i love this movie so much. it always makes me cry. if you appreciate drew barrymore half as much as i do, you'll love this movie. it's got all the essentials i look for in a movie. it has good actors, good characters, good humor...a lot of heart-warming moments too. the flash-back moments when we see josie in high school make me cry though. every single time. i'm sure you'll like this one, don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even though it is, in a way, a teen movie. sure, if you're a guy, and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time, then this isn't for you. but if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: drew barrymore is great in this one!
