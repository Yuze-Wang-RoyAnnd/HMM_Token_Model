in 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. steven spielberg's et, and john carpenter's the thing. of the two of them, et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though the thing debuted first. because people were so entranced with spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from the thing in droves.<br /><br />its not hard to see why. the two are diametrically opposed. one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. the other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />it's taken some time, but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. as it should. because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake. it takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, alien. and that's even rarer!<br /><br />carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did. it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. but although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />frequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns, hot off the success of escape from new york, cast once again as one of carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. he plays macready, the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macready's, trying to gun down a siberian husky from the air.<br /><br />they end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the husky and add it to their own. except that this husky, is not a husky at all. but a shape-changing alien. the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />the thing is one of john carpenter's finest films. in fact i'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star. the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it. films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />but the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers. never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. not even in the ferocious assault on precinct 13. from the second the alien makes its presence known, carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. and when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />the film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. an approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. amorphous shapes. half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, the thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />that type of thinking misses the point entirely. it only shortchanges the film's values. and there are many. carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. characterisation has never been one of john carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in the thing. because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. we're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. and because of this, the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />a special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone. a pulsing thud thud every two seconds. it creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. the scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />the thing is a pure unadulterated classic. even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. an underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received. and so much better than et!
