i went into "the closer she gets" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. i expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie. and although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. it shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together. they refuse to lose faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. <br /><br />the most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed. little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness. in this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film. we should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.
