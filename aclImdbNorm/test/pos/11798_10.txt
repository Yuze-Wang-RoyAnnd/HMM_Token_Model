i had never heard about this movie when it was given to me to translate, so i didn't know what to expect. i checked it out on imdb and got curious. it didn't take long to realize that this was a gem. outstanding performances, great story, and it's both well directed and well written. it's hard to compare it to other movies, but "stand by me" comes to mind, although it has as many differences from "the cure" as similarities. the tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys, plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and "stand by me". other than that, "the cure" is a fine movie in its own right, well worth a wider recognition. it's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. i can't think of a single thing that bothers me about it. having said that, i don't want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but rather that i enjoyed it immensely, was very moved by it and wouldn't change a thing in it. i won't go into a detailed description of the story/plot, partly because it would be either too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site. in closing, i can only say: wonderful movie, see it if you get the chance.
