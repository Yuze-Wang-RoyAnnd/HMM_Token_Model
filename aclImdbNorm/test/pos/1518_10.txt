simply beautiful. one of the best mind-- umm... screws--- in existence. both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract. moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this film. they could also do worse than hiring alan rickman. five out of five stars, and at present (1-20-2000) #2 on my top 100 films of all time list.
