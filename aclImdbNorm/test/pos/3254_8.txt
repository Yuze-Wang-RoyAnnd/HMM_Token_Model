having seen, and loved this film in australia, i was very keen to get me paws on a copy. i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it's a very different edit.<br /><br />the domestic australain edit i saw is snappier. the uk ,and i presume european, edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmy's dead brother.and in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefit.<br /><br />it is not a serious criticism, but the oz edit is just brisker and i think more assured.<br /><br />i can't say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market?<br /><br />so careful about which one you go for.<br /><br />i went for both.
