alistair simms is a wonder in this. he makes such a good headmistress. the role given here for george cole was made for him. hence, the casting job on this film was perfect. i think it was one of those rare occasions where everything clicked. the story line was good, the comic dialogue a scream and the older prefect girls a delight!! each character you are endeared to, even the villains. why can't we make films like this any more. basically, this is a very english comedy with good movement and fluidity.
