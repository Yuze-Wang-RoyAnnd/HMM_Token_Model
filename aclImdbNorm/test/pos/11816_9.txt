even though this film is 11 years old, i just rented it yesterday, and i found it to be a really touching film. the story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touching.<br /><br />while i did not care much for the amount of language used by some of the young actors--especially from renfro--i understand that art is imitating life. renfro once again does a magnificent job of the rough-and-tough, very (and i mean very) disturbed wannabe bully (his role in the client comes to mind), and mazzello does a wonderful job of the witty, somewhat quirky, dexter--a child who realizes that his life must end too soon.<br /><br />while there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie, i have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by pony in the abandoned church, and dexter (mazzello) cut himself, saying his blood was poison. while very resourceful, and somewhat amusing seeing a grown man running away from two little kids, it's one of the hardest scenes in the film.<br /><br />definitely check this one out, but prepared with your kleenex--you'll need it!
