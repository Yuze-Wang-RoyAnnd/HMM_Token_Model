a very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie. through the sport of rugby as a mean, a high school rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle, on and off the field. <br /><br />the acting and directing are good. the rugby shots are just ok if you know some rugby or really cool if don't know much about it.<br /><br />i recommend this movie, worth watching, especially at a point in time when this sport is gaining more and more adepts every day.<br /><br />the plot is based on a true story taking place in utah. the coach portrayed in this movie has been at the helm of the highlanders for over 30 years (and loosing only game every 3 years). <br /><br />enjoy!
