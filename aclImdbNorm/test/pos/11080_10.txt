the falcon and the snowman is based on a true story. christopher boyce, and andrew daulton lee, (the titular traitors,) played by timothy hutton and sean penn, received their code- names from the kgb. why? boyce was an avid falconer and lee was a coke head. the movie is based on a true story. it's based on the book of the same name. another reviewer asked what was their motivation? disillusionment it ain't. ideology it ain't. (pardon my bad grammar,) but i'm making a point here. what was it if it wasn't disillusionment or ideology? in a word, greed. by the time of the boyce-lee case, money became the great motivator and not ideology. don't believe me? then look at the walker family spy ring which was broken in the late '80s. three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the '70s and '80s. john walker, who began his career as a spy in the '60s, christopher boyce, and andrew daulton lee. all three sold out this country for thirty pieces of silver. if you aren't familiar with that phrase, i suggest you read the bible.
