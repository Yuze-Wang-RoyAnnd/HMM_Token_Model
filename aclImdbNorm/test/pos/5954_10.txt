as a french, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of french like that, at some defaults of westerners, at spy movies etc...and at a lot of other things too, en route... i already saw it 3 times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears... jean dujardin, b'er'enice b'ejo, aure atika the director and all the cast, all the crew did a fantastic job. this movie is funny but is although much more than that : it's got plenty of levels to it. you laugh because of simple gags, because of some critics made with wit (the movie's courageous enough to be critical), because of physical comedy, because you believe in the characters etc... esthetically and musically, it's a success too. go see it if you can.
