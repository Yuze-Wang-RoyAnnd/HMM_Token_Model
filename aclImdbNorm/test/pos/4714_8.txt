i came across this movie on tv. i hadn't heard of it before and almost changed the channel, but it quickly hooked me.<br /><br />the story of the struggle of the burmese people against a military dictatorship was provoking. the level of brutality that some are willing to use to hold onto power is hard to believe. it makes me thankful to live in a country where the government isn't likely to shoot people in the streets.<br /><br />the story of laura bowman was a good thread to hold the story of political struggle together.
