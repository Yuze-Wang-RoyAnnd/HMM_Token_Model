a wonderful story that should be seen by all families. the story, acting, and production values are all first rate. i highly recommend "checking out!"<br /><br />peter falk is marvelous as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die, so he can continue to know how things will end and not be "a member of the audience." his three children rush to new york to confront him and try to change his mind. there are, of course unresolved family issues to be addressed, and the script and actors handle them well and with great humor. <br /><br />the story is about a jewish family, but it could easily be about any other family. well, maybe not a wasp family. the siblings have issues with each other and also with their father. i loved the writing and directing, as well as the acting. all in all, a humorous and touching film.
