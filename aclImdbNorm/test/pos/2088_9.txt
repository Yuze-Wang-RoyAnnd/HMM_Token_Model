i watched "9 souls" in athens' 12th international film festival (september 2006), where toshiaki toyoda, the films's director was also present and answered many questions of the audience. this road film is about 9 fugitives, all very different characters from each other. they decide to stay together travelling with their red van across japan. every time the van stops, we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape from their past in order to build up a new life or to fulfil a dream. however, no matter how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their final destruction.<br /><br />though a very pessimistic film, it is not a dark film. on the contrary, it is full of beautiful pictures, surreal elements and elegant humor. toyoda's heroes cannot escape their "prison" and they face a divine(?) punishment for their "crimes". they are small pieces of a beautiful painting, where the tower of tokyo depicted as a huge knife turned upside down prevails!
