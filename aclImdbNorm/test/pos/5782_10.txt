the end of suburbia (teos) is a very useful film. it's also important and provocative. there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-sprawl meister, james howard kunstler. <br /><br />while i am not a big fan of the new urbanism, my criticism of it is because of its small vision. in the case of new urbanist peter calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added teos out-takes... calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil. <br /><br />i've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by neoclassical economics - and also as a vehicle for educating about: peak oil, our wastrel land use, global warming, our threatened food production, public transit our compromised future<br /><br />move over south park! .... made by canadians from toronto for $25,000 and released in may 2004, this video sold over 24,000 copies by october 2005. one major dvd rental vendor recently ordered almost 400 more copies.<br /><br />the end of suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 1/2 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005.<br /><br />a sequel, escape from suburbia, is in the works with a possible release by august 2006.
