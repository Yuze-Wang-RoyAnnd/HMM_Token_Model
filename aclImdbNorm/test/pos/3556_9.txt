i very nearly did not see 'hi-de-hi!'. i think it must have been the title that put me off. in those days, the welsh language editions of 'the radio times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about. 'hi-de-hi!' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by leslie crowther or worse an inane u.s. import. but i managed to catch a later episode, and was surprised to find it written by jimmy perry and david croft.<br /><br />as was the case with 'dad's army' and 'it ain't half hot mum', perry based it on personal experiences, in this case his time at a butlins' holiday camp. before cheap air travel came along in the '60's, these camps sprang up along british coastlines, providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners.<br /><br />( as a matter of interest, i worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef - barry island, south wales - known to all and sundry as 'shag land' for reasons i won't go into! )<br /><br />set in the late '50's, it began with university academic jeffrey fairbrother ( simon cadell ) taking over as the entertainments manager of maplin's, a job he was ill equipped to handle. his staff included resident comic ted bovis ( paul shane ), his sidekick spike ( jeffrey holland ), miserable punch and judy man mr.partridge ( leslie dwyer ), snobby ballroom dancers barry ( barry howard ) and yvonne stuart-hargreaves ) diane holland ), and the unforgettable gladys pugh ( ruth madoc ), who lusted after fairbrother at every opportunity. bubbly su pollard stole the show though as cleaner peggy ollerenshaw, whose driving ambition was to be a 'yellowcoat' ( all the important staff members wore them ). a number of sexy girls occupied these coats too, most notably nikki kelly's 'sylvia' and statuesque rikki howard's 'betty'. we never saw joe maplin, the owner. he communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives, which poor jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "hi-de-hi!" was the campers' greeting, usually met with the equally inane 'ho-de-ho!. <br /><br />one fan was the late sir fred pontin, who told perry and croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life.<br /><br />i always found bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic, like archie rice he was the comedian whose big break never came, reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late-night audiences. he took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks, and in one memorable episode fairbrother's patience snapped and he sounded him out: "lies, ted! all lies!".<br /><br />as with every other perry/croft series, the cast were excellent, particularly cadell and shane. ruth madoc's prissy 'gladys' got on my nerves ( no wonder anne robinson hates the welsh! ), but leslie dwyer's misanthropic 'mr.partridge' and felix bowness' jockey 'fred qulley' more than compensated. <br /><br />the visual gag everyone remembers is drunken mr.partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach. looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating! <br /><br />with its frothy blend of '50's nostalgia and saucy gags, 'hi-de'hi' was a big hit for b.b.c.-1 in the '80's, resulting in a massive increase in bookings for butlins and pontins. it went downhill when cadell left to return to the theatre though. i never took to his replacement, squadron leader clive dempster ( david griffin ). worse, leslie dwyer's death robbed the show of one of its best characters. kenneth connor was brought in to replace him as 'uncle sammy'.<br /><br />the period setting occasionally caused problems; in one episode, sylvia and betty had to dive into the pool to rescue peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark. the revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era. still they looked great in them so who's complaining? in another, ted sang the tom jones hit 'delilah' to campers. it was not composed ( by les reed and barry mason, incidentally ) until 1968.<br /><br />maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was that of peggy ( now a yellowcoat ) all alone in the camp, jumping into the air and shouting ( what else? ) 'hi-de-hi!'. <br /><br />i don't rate it as highly as perry and croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable. it was probably one of the last british sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection, mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting. goodnight campers!
