may contain spoilers<br /><br />this historical movie was so refreshing. although it may be exagerating the actual events, it does show the heartless nature of emperor qui, which he was later infamous for. and there wasn't a single computer generated person in it. i think it's great that china has produce such an epic film. the costumes and the settings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. dignity vs. death is a major theme in this movie and i think it reflects the chinese history and culture. i also enjoyed a little allusion to the terracotta warriors, a 3d map carved of the conquest of china with individual soldiers. emperor qui of course later as entombed with his life size terracotta warriors.<br /><br />i also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he only had a small scene.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />
