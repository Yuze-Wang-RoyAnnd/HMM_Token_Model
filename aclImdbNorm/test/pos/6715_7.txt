lifeforce starts in outer space where the hms churchill tracks haley's comet & it's equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet, unable to contact earth because of interference colonel tom carlsen (steve railsback) decides this is the one & only chance to investigate it. going outside in spacesuits carlsen & some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship & find the remains of a bat like race of creatures & three perfect looking humanoids, two men (chris jagger & bill malin) & a beautiful woman (mathilda may) all of whom they take aboard the churchill. thirty days later & back on earth the churchill is detected on radar, a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out & all the crew supposedly dead. the rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though & take them back to earth where in a space research center in london they come back to life & start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust, things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout london...<br /><br />this english production was produced by the notorious menahem golan & yoram globus who during the early 80's were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company cannon usually starring chuck norris & they wanted to move into the big time & signed director tobe hooper up on a three film deal (which were this lifeforce, the invaders from mars (1986) remake & the texas chainsaw massacre 2 (1986) a sequel to hooper's own classic) all of which flopped & basically bankrupt both golan & globus & cannon was no more. anyway, despite being a commercial flop at the box-office i have to say i think lifeforce is a highly enjoyable, if rather silly sci-fi horror. when originally released into theatres back in '85 lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by golan & globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on dvd, vhs, laserdisc & tv although apparently hooper's original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so there's even more footage out there somewhere. i will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut, the script by dan o'bannon, don jakoby & uncredited rewrites by michael armstrong & olaf pooley was based on the 1976 novel 'the space vampires' by colin wilson & has many extraordinary ideas, it's scope is truly ambitious & one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one. it moves along like a rocket & at heart there's a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle. there are also some hilarious moments in lifeforce, the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic, the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where railsback ends up kissing patrick stewart & many, many more besides. i don't know, call me weird but i just thought lifeforce was tremendous fun & highly entertaining in just about every way, from silly character's, odd dialogue, strange ideas that never quite come together & some terrific visuals lifeforce certainly isn't a film that will bore you.<br /><br />director hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has (double what he had for poltergeist (1982) even) & he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen, john dykstra the guy responsible for star wars (1977), star trek: the motion picture (1979) & more recently spider-man (2002) was brought in to handle the visual effects & generally speaking they look fabulous. the sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great, there's also some really good visual effects back on earth including the destruction of london as 100's of blue souls fly around everywhere. there's some nudity but not much gore, there are some withered corpses, a few gunshot wounds, the skin on someones hand peels off, blood spurts from someones eyes, nose & ears & there's a severed arm as well as some zombies. the special make-up effects are also generally very good. i wouldn't say lifeforce is scary as such as it's more of a sci-fi film than horror, i loved the way hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness & that there is no 'solid' floor as it were.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 it made less than half that in it's theatrical run & hasn't set the world alight on video or dvd either which is a shame because although it's a bit of a mess it's very enjoyable to watch. shot on location in england. well filmed in 2:35:1 widescreen, the 4:3 cropped image is horrible & cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen, this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it's hard to make out what's going on & the sense of the vastness of space & the alien spaceship is lost. the acting is ok in a very silly film, patrick stewart replaced sir john gielgud, nancy paul replaced olivia hussey, frank finlay replaced klaus kinski while anthony hopkins turned the role of caine down.<br /><br />lifeforce is a bizarre film, no two ways about it really & anyone looking for something simple & straight forward should look elsewhere. anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci-fi genre than give lifeforce a go as it's one of those so bad it's good films with some impressive effects & it isn't your average run of the mill film by any means.
