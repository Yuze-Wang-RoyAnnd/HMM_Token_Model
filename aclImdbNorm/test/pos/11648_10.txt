having read most of the comments i feel like i have a word to say as well.<br /><br />what bothers me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them. i remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published (yes, it has interested me so much ever since i heard that it would come out that i have not forgotten about the articles i read back then) in which tim robbins said that he did not want to make a movie to convince audiences of neither one nor the other.<br /><br />and i think that is completely right. i have to admit that i believe that in the way he made this film he did tend a little bit to the anti-death-penalty-side, but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choice. and this is a very rare thing in american films.<br /><br />i have shown this movie to many people since it came out and i have seen all kinds of reactions. death-penalty-supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their belief. and many death-penalty-opponents (including me) grew stronger in their belief that death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world. but i have even seen opponents turn into supporters. this and the fact that people here seem to fight about it shows to me that there are really many ways of looking at it. so whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you think.<br /><br />this is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice, that does not shy away with a simple path by making the convicted either bad or innocent. this may be a tough thing for people who prefer being entertained or tought a lesson. there is no lesson here you need to find one yourself.<br /><br />everyone praises the acting, directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the i will not repeat it all again.<br /><br />so if you have not seen this yet, do so - if you dare to be challenged!
