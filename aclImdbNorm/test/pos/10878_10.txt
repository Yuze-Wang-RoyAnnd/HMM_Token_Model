two years after its initial release, goldeneye still sits atop the field of first-person shooters for the nintendo 64. even the quake and turok series have not had the combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and overall fun that bring me back to this game over and over again. the missions each have specific objectives that force you to think as bond, not just to shoot up every baddie that pops up on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect the bond girl, and so on. q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous watch. the game is loosely based on the movie storyline, including all the major characters and the best scenes of the movie, from the dam bungee-jump to the prop-plane escape to the tank chase through st. petersburg. even the layout is preserved where possible, so you'll recognize various situations if you've seen the film. other levels are added to challenge the player and string together the scenes a little more. with each difficulty level the mission objectives are more difficult, the enemies smarter and the bullets more lethal. i still have not gotten through the 00-agent levels. cheats can be opened, not by entering codes or pushing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain time frame, and additional characters can be opened up for the multiplayer. the multiplayer is still the best among the first-person shooters. it's not as crisp as turok but it doesn't slow down nearly as much... tons of options give your friends reason to blow each other up over and over again, and one more time just for kicks. there are better games for the n64, such as zelda and all things star wars, but rare has continued their streak of outstanding games with a first-person shooter that has not and will not be surpassed until they top themselves in 2000 with perfect dark.
