i think i am some kind of road runner fan. i don't care how predictable it is, i laugh anyway. 'beep, beep' is predictable most of the time, although it is pretty ingenious at the same time as well. of course the road runner is chased by the coyote and of course the coyote fails to catch the road runner with every new attempt. the plans the coyote comes up with are very funny. you see exactly where it will go wrong and you will not disappointed. well, one time you are sort of disappointed, what you think will happen does not, but it makes the joke even funnier.<br /><br />if you like the road runner shorts you will love this one. the predictable gags work and the animation is great and pretty original at times.
