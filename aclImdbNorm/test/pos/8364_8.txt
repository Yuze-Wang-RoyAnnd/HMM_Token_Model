shazam was okay, but hero high was my favorite when i was a kid, i mean before there was sky high(2005) and zoom(2006), there was hero high, a school for super hero's in training, teenagers with super powers would help police capture bad guys, and other times they would get in embarrassing situations like the greatest american hero(1981). it was a fun cartoon to watch, what was also fun, was the live action stage show called the kid superpower hour with shazam. the actors who voiced the characters, also dressed has there characters in the show. rex ruthless(john berwick), misty magic(jere fields), weatherman(jim greenleaf), captain california(chris hensel, who also sang the theme song), dirty trixie(maylo mccaslin), glorious gal(becky perle, who looks like the love child of superman and wonder woman), and punk rock(johnny venocour). the whole cast just went with anything, when it came to the jokes. the cartoon was a fun superhero comedy, i shore up it will come back in live action like fat albert(2004)
