originally i was a tenacious d fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off the p.o.d. and was rather disappointed. after watching the movie, my view was changed. the movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that kg and jaybles portray in the movie. <br /><br />much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies i have seen in the theaters lately. ex. saw iii (dull and dragging), casino royale (way to homo-erotic) which in prior installments i have really enjoyed <br /><br />if you enjoyed borat, you will enjoy the tale of the greatest band on earth
