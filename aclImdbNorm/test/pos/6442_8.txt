for years i've had a distant memory of watching this film , i looked on the net to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere so i thought it must have disappeared.<br /><br />until...my gran showed me a box set she sent off for in the daily mail and i though nah there wont be anything decent in there, but to my great surprise there amongst other gems was the water babies! i hadn't been that excited ina long long time! its a great light hearted film, the songs aren't memorable probably if i was a child during the time it came out i would have stuck in my mind more. sadly it was just a film i watched at my grans 10 years ago when i was a little spud. and watching it back now the animation is terrible! and the re-recored voices they do to get a richness to the sound in films is totally off! but who cares when your a kid you never think of those things, even if they lead boy is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty.<br /><br />great classic kids film!
