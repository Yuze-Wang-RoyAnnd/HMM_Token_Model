what a refreshing change from the pg movies that have teen girls jumping in and out of bed, young high school boys counting how many girls they can "hook up" with, kids drinking, doing drugs, etc., etc., etc. carl hiaasen has written so many books that are enjoyable but hardly classic literature. but he has finally written something that middle school kids want to read. and this movie sends a message to kids that maybe they can make a difference, that maybe their voices can be heard. filmed in south florida, the scenery is beautiful and natural and real. who cares if its predictable, and a little corny. so was free willy and look how well that did. this is a good family movie..........a rare breed.
