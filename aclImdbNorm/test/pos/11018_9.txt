i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. i was immediately sucked in by the characters.<br /><br />robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. really, this sort of thing is not easy to do. she pulls it off fantastically.<br /><br />we know early on this film is going to end tragically, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. the characters do stupid things, but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters.<br /><br />this is just a great example of film making imho. great writing, great acting, great directing. a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.
