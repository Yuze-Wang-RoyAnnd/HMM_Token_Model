victor sj"ostr"om was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! that's pretty amazing. while today few have any idea who sj"ostr"om was, he might be familiar to ingmar bergman fans as the star one of bergman's most acclaimed films, wild strawberries.<br /><br />as far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. on one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. the idea of the grim reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. plus, the special effect of the phantom carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. on the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in sunday school instead of in an honest to goodness theater. plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying salvation army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. why is she "in love" with this man? am i missing something?<br /><br />so, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. but, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.
