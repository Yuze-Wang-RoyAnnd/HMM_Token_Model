bride of chucky starts late one night as officer bob bailey (vince corazza) sneaks into the evidence room at his police station & amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the chucky doll that serial killer charles lee ray possessed way back in the original child's play (1988). he drives the remains to an isolated area where ray's ex girlfriend tiffany (jennifer tilly) slashes bailey's throat & takes the remains back to her trailer. there tiffany stitches & staples chucky (voiced by brad dourif) back together again & using a 'voodoo for dummies' book brings him back to murderous life. thing don't go as tiffany had hoped & chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which chucky is less than happy. while tiffany takes a bath chucky escapes, electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride. neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies & have to work together to get to a cemetery in new jersey where ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies. the bodies of tiffany's neighbour jesse (nick stabile) & his girlfriend jade (katherine heigl), who are both on the run from jade's corrupt uncle chief of police warren kincaid (john ritter), will do nicely...<br /><br />directed by ronny yu i love bride of chucky. the script by don mancini is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection. from the opening sequence where we see jason voorhees hockey mask from the friday the 13th films, freddy krueger's razor blade glove from the a nightmare on elm street series & michael myers mask from the halloween franchise. to the clips used from bride of frankenstein (1935) when it virtually recreates the same scene. bride of chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well, there are lots of one liners, self referential gags that scream (1996) made trendy a few years earlier & it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself & the horror genre in general. i love the scene when jesse & jade are having a clich'ed slushy romantic conversation that chucky hears & he makes funny derogatory comments & gestures throughout. that's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is. director yu manages to create good atmosphere & a real sense of fun, both human & plastic sets of characters are likable & shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause. technically bride of chucky is great for the most part & has that big budget polish about it & at about $25,000,000 i should hope so. the only thing that i will say is that some of the puppet effects by kevin yagher are a little stiff & unconvincing, i can't remember any cgi scenes in bride of chucky either. thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood & gore with a cool slit throat, nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a hellraiser (1987) homage, people impaled on shards of glass, someone being bloodily obliterated by a huge truck, a ripped off lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots. the acting is pretty good & dourif as chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out. i also like the scenes with tiffany at the beginning & find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear, i can't be the only one surely? i personally think bride of chucky is a fantastic film, total entertainment from start to finish, great humour & horror in equal measure & at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull. a personal favourite of mine, watch it as soon as you can!
