chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!<br /><br />when chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. tiffany and chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk!!<br /><br />don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. it is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!<br /><br />my rating : 9/10.
