this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />this is six episodes tracing (briefly) what life may have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth. done in the style of a nature documentary this show does away with talking heads instead just gives us the good stuff with the dinosaurs attempting to survive.<br /><br />certainly this isn't a true documentary since none of what we see on screen can be attested to with any certainty, but its a best guess, and an entertaining one at that. here is a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve them eating people. this is a show that should be shown to any kid who loves dinosaurs since it will instill them with the oh wow factor to go out and find out more. it will also entertain the hell out of them, and you.<br /><br />see this. if you love animal shows or nature or science or disney true life adventures (except no one really gets killed) or just a really good trip to somewhere else run out and get yourself a copy. your brain will thank you.
