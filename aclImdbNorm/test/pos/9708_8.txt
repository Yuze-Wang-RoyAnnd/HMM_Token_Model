it's what you expect. it induces laughter, cringing, and dry-heaving, not necessarily in that order. it's over-the-top. you will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind's eye. " jackass number two" is better than the first; the actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie. there are many stunts which could have killed the actors, especially johnny knoxville. the treatment of animals was suspect, but other than that, the movie achieved what is was made to achieve. if you like the preview, see the movie. if you don't, steer clear! <br /><br />8 out of 10
