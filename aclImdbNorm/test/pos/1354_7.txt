if sicily is a territory of the baroque, with its doubling of perspective, that's part of this movie's challenge to realism. and it's an exuberant pleasure here, outdoing fellini with not one but three film directors, plus of course the actual bellocchio, who has made some really great movies and shouldn't be touchy about his honor. there is a variety of takes and casting improvisations on manzoni's "i promessi sposi" with, somewhere there, actual marriage. sicily is also taken to be a territory of skulduggery (you already know this version of the island, so there's no spoiler involved), a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio castellito's work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo.
