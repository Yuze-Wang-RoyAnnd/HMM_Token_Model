i've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and i finally did since it's proper rebirth on dvd. of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if i had seen in it the 80s, but director lieberman (his film "squirm" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. a high note, brad fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans. a must see if you like underrated horror films. to describe it would be an intelligent "friday the 13th" sprinkled with some tasty bits of "deliverance." with that aside, there are some really cool & original moments like my favorite when a couple are swimming in a lake and the guy disappears underwater to play a trick on his gal - just when you think it's the usual scare, she suddenly looks to shore and...i honestly can't spoil it -you just have to watch it for yourself. also, the ending is just one of those that you just have to see to believe
