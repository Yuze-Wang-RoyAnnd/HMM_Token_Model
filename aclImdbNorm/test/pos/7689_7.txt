i had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last 35mm, technicolor, stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered. also closer to the original material -- basically, all screenwriter n. richard nash did was trim, change much recitative to spoken dialog, and insert a transitional scene or two (including a very amusing one for pearl bailey). oliver smith's production design is stagy in the "li'l abner"-"guys and dolls" '50s adaptation mode, but it works well for this work's folkloric, unrealistic quality. stereotyping and racism are present, but not to a wince-inducing degree. further, for a movie of its time, it's pretty frank -- the adultery, violent behavior, drug use, and self-destructive habits of the denizens of catfish row are not at all minimized in the telling. but there are debits, beginning with all that variation from the stage text. the loss of so much compromises gershwin's brilliance -- no wonder the family doesn't like it. the reorchestration, especially of sammy davis jr.'s material, is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar. george knew what he was doing, folks; you didn't have to mess with it so much. and while poitier and dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well, there's a huge chasm between the characters' singing and speaking voices -- you're constantly aware of the artifice. what really counts here, of course, is the music, among the greatest ever written for the theater, anywhere. despite all the tinkering, it survives,and you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it. if the treatment isn't entirely to the estate's liking (and it shouldn't be), there's still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of gershwin's masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius.
