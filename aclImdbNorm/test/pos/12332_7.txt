i was kinda surprised by the pg rating on the back of the dvd case. i certainly wouldn't want my kids watching this one. i think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year old.<br /><br />plot: a girl trying to fit in to the clique is hazed and tormented by the 'in crowd.' they talk her into spending the night in this creepy mausoleum (that reminded me of phantasm...) and they proceed to torment her in the night. little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them! it sounds awfully cheesy, but given the age and the budget, which was no doubt pretty small, this film is fun on many levels.<br /><br />watch for an early eg daily as one of the in crowd brats. i enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend.<br /><br />7 out of 10, kids.
