one of my favorite hartley movies. (as if there could be a "bad" one.) although, this may be a bit more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect. nonetheless, it still maintains that hartley slant to which we've all become accustomed.<br /><br />first picture jesus and satan discussing their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the impending end of civilization. now imagine the entire conversation taking place over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar. and as an added conversational (not to mention visual) distraction, let's toss in pj harvey as the sultry companion (aka magdelena) to mr. chist. then, just for grins, in the background, an ever present salvation army band (played by yo la tengo) to serve as an added diversion. the road to moral justification has never been such a pleasure.<br /><br />quite possibly more questions than answers, but therein lies the fun. and mr. donovan is subdued brilliance, as always.
