joseph conrad's timeless novel, heart of darkness, was depicted in the 1994 movie. i have read conrad's novel, and i must say, even though i prefer the novel itself, the movie was a great depiction. the set and costume designs brought conrad's novel to life on the screen as we followed marlow's journey. the acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms, voices, and personalities. if you have read the novel, i recommend that you also view this movie. if you have not read the novel, however, the movie may be harder to follow. conrad's heart of darkness is too full of action, emotion, and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long. therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow. overall i gave this movie a seven out of ten. the basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets, costumes, and acting. nothing can replace joseph conrad's original work however.
