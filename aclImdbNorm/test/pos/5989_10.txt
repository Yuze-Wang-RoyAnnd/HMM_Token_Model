i love foreign films and this is among the best. i tend to not see this as a comedy as it is listed and find it a commentary on how we see others around us. firmine the lead in the film is not regarded must as she is a domestic in a large firm and people say and do things around her all the time that they otherwise would not say in front of others.<br /><br />this leaves her with a bevy of information that can make or break the mere mortal. :) this actress is wonderful as this character and it is a poignant tale. there is an underlying tale and almost many stories within the story in this film. i just hope that if someone does decide to make an american/english version of this film it is not the vein of three men and a baby that would definitely do a disservice to this film, a must see.....
