i have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show being racist and homophobic, but i don't feel that is what this show is about.<br /><br />the show is about parents who weren't ready for kids and are now not ready for teenagers. this show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked: parenthood.<br /><br />yes we have all had shows that had families in it, for example: family matters, step by step, family ties, full house....but it always would have the same old recipe to it's episodes. "steph" cuts from school and gets caught by her father. they have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and it's over with a two week grounding that after an "aww, dad..." gets a smile and the show is over. where is the comedy in such a situation? where is the realism? with the war at home, you get real situations from a real father type figure. most parents that watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh (cause they know they've said it!) or they nod their heads (cause they know they've thought it and never had the guts to say it!) the war at home has situations that bring out great comedy as a father thinking his son is gay. doesn't sound funny, most think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy comes in the bumbling father trying to talk to his son to open up. what parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation as this? i greatly recommend this show to anyone that i know has a sense of humor, and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had kids. you relate to a show like this when you are either.
