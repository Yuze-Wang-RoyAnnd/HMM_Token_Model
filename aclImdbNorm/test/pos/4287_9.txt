now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly . now-a-days it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to each other.<br /><br />there are no explosions, car chases or any chases,there are implied sexual situations.this is not film for the younger crowd, it is for those that appreciate people talking to each other,they do argue a lot as we have married couple having mid life problems.<br /><br />emily watson & tom wilkinson are seemingly a very happy middle aged loving man & wife. now living in this same small london suburb, handsome, rupert everett returns home to visit his wealthy father.<br /><br />he of course meets emily watson, it would be easy for anyone to be smitten by emily. i say no more, except that as the credits begin there is a fatal accident,the rest of the film is about the repercussions of this accident & all the lies the various characters tell..<br /><br />the acting by this trio & the others is excellent.<br /><br />julien fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by nigel balchin. he also directed, this was his first directorial attempt & he did very well. the entire production is first rate.<br /><br />the film had a few month theatrical run in late 2005, is under 80 theatres. this to me is a shame, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but real good drams as this & many others open in only a few.<br /><br />by the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations.<br /><br />ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) imdb 9 (out of 10)
