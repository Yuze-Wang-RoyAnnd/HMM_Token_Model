well, it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film, but somehow multiple different genres and a clich'ed plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films i've seen in ages! the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a 'road trip' style teenage comedy and a 'texas chainsaw massacre' style redneck horror vibe, and while one gets in the way of the other quite often; director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next. things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters, both irritating in different ways. adam is a wussy virgin, while harley is a fat big-mouthed "a-hole". they're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school. after a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitch-hiker, and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown...<br /><br />the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest assets. the truck itself looks spooky because it's so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful. after a while, you begin to get used to the characters and once aimee brooks enters the fray, things start to look up. the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well, as justin ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitch-hiker are interesting enough. just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any messier, things take a turn for the weird in the final third. without spoiling things, it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldn't possibly be seen coming, and along with the twist, is a big surprise. some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end - but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits... overall, this isn't a 'great' film by any means - but if you're looking for some silly entertainment, monster man should hit the spot!
