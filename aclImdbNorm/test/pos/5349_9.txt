my only problem with the curse of the were-rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and gromit to those not familiar with park's short films. strangely, "a close shave" manages to do this with a lot less time to spare. still, i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters, human and otherwise. i especially loved ralph fiennes voice as the scheming victor quartermaine. it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen. the workmanship with the clay characters really stands out. it's a hoot, and great for the whole family! i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and gromit and will happily add this one.
