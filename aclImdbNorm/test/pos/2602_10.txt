this is my all time favorite looney tunes cartoon. it's a common plot: daffy duck tries to convince elmer fudd that it is really rabbit season and shoot bugs. but your can never outsmart that rabbit! in addition to usual cartoon comedy, this cartoon is supported by great word play that will keep you rolling on the floor.
