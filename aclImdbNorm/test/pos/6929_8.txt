i like dylan moran from his work in black books, although i found some of his stand-up to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps... however i was intrigued to see this film starring he and michael caine and curiosity got the better of me.<br /><br />i was stunned.<br /><br />dylan's vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect, something beyond the skills of a mere stand-up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness, john hurt and the other greats- truly he was skilled in his portrayal.<br /><br />michael caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard british film device of having a precocious child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked- the only aspect i didn't really like was the unbelieveable plot feature of the chemistry between dolores and the cockney gangsta's hard man played by dylan.<br /><br />other than that, it was great.<br /><br />i also like the non-cop-out ending where it did end up happily ever after, but with mc getting a beating. ok, it's not exactly being strung up by your goolies and beijng disembowelled (which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you nicked lb50k off them) but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story.<br /><br />i liked the film, and i would recommend it to anyone- but- i would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow. if you stick it out, then it will all come back.<br /><br />and with regards to the swearing- well, they're in ireland. it wouldn't be real otherwise.
