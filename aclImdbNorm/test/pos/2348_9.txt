i liked this movie, the second naruto feature film. i enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as i found the story here a bit disjointed as i was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when. still, like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half, plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights. the story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants. it then shits to naruto, sakura, and shikumaru hunting down a ferret for what they think is going to be an easy assignment. they soon find out otherwise as they are also attacked and naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior clad in armor. they both are injured and taken in by a caravan and soon after naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wishes to create a utopia. of course, all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around. my favorite was the one involving garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly which is a very big mistake. the concluding fight is rather good too involving naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of those in the previous movie.
