dogtown and z-boys<br /><br />summary: dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in venice (dogtown), california as we know it today. with their low pivotal style, they embarked on a larry bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. after the dogtown articles were featured in a reinstated skateboarder magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the zephyr skateboard team forgot about jeff ho, and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. the original zephyr skateboard team put together by jeff ho (zephyr surfshop owner) and craig stecyk (photographer) included jay adams, tony alva, stacy peralta, bob biniak, chris cahill, shogo kubo, paul constantineau, jim muir, peggy oki (the only female), nathan pratt, wentzle ruml iv, allen sarlo, and david ray perry. all of the original members except jay adams and chris cahill are still well and surfing/skating. jay adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. chris cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in mexico.<br /><br />themes: the themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines, but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future, and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.<br /><br />other works: stacy peralta (writer and director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced, or directed. most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as riding giants, sk8 tv, the bones brigrades, and lords of dogtown. he has also done films with a theme of growing up in america as a teenager, films such as: influences: from yesterday to today, crips and bloods: made in america, and the 70s: the decade that changed television.<br /><br />subjects: the subjects of dogtown and z-boys are the original members of the zephyr skateboard team excluding chris cahill. peralta included jeff ho and craig stecyk in the interviews. other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the dogtown articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. skaters from the dogtown area, but not on the team were interviewed.<br /><br />editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. there were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character, but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song old man by neil young was played, which evokes many emotions. sean penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. the film was presented chronologically from the time the zephyr surf team was put together, to creating the skateboard team, to all of the z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /><br />cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way. the film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the z-boys surfing or skating were in color. of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. the interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears, but all were outside. all of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which i found very surprising. <br /><br />music: "seasons of wither"-performed by aerosmith "toys in the attic"-performed by aerosmith "generation landslide"- alice cooper "one way out"- performed by
