i saw this film at the 2005 palm springs international film festival. i went in with the assumption that if it stars chiwetel ejiofor and hilary swank it had to be at least decent. well, after a kind of a slow start, i was far from disappointed. in fact, i was quite pleased with the final product.<br /><br />i must admit the afrikaaner and xhosa(?) accented english of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing "waking ned devine", "trainspotting" or any other film with heavy-accented actors i adjusted after about 15 minutes. and i was trying to figure out why hilary swank was supposed to be south african and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very american... as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent. but later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the us as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent. so it began to make sense that only certain words might have a afrikaaner lilt to them.<br /><br />i know it's a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a truth and reconciliation trial. i'd heard about the t and r process in south africa after the fall of apartheid but i didn't really know how it worked.<br /><br />the final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived, this was overall a very strong film. the closing sequence where the "truth" comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for. a definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders.
