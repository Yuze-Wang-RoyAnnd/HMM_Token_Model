the chasers war on everything. 5 words that i love to watch. the chasers war on everything is an excellent australian comedy. as the name suggests they wage war on everything. they seem to love hitting the politions most of all.<br /><br />the chaser is one of the best comedies i have seen and is the top of the line in australia. it is on the australian broadcasting corparation (abc) which is where some of the best comedies are.<br /><br />it has won the australian film industry (afi) awards but did not win the best comedy at the logies. <br /><br />last year (2006) the chaser was aired on abc on friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch it. well they have been moved to wednesday nights at 9pm (a heaps better timeslot) and the best thing is if i miss an episode or even just want to see it again i can download it from www.abc.net.au/chaser.
