i have no idea what the budget on this movie was, but whatever it was they made it work! i have seen movies that spend 100x the amount (pearl harbor anyone?) and sucked 200x worse. this movie has everything. david "makin' it" naughton in the lead role as adam, an average college student who gets wrapped up in a game called the great allnighter" run by leon! this guy rocks! a "genius" with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate game for a bunch of people to play. but he doesn't just pick his friends. he has a team of jocks, nerds, fatties, average kids and of course, flounder's team who are the "bad guys". but this movie has no black and white. there are many shades of gray. adam is not the altruistic hero with no faults. he treats alex p. like crap. and flounder is the way he is because of pressures from his dad and a cranky stomach. the jocks play dirty, but so does everyone else! this movie rocks! the scene at the pbr factory? classic! "johnny's obese male child?" can you write a better clue? this stuff is gold jerry! gold! maybe i am from a different generation, but i love movies that seem far-fetched but still have roots in reality. this never happened...but it could. eeeee-gypt.... eeee....easter bunny....easter parade! oh and watch for a young paul rubens still working on that pee wee character. ps that devra clinger was/is hot! she must have been one bad actress not to work in hollywood anymore. see this movie!
