"the charge at feather river" is a routine western about the u. s. cavalry against the cheyenne indians... the film carried a constantly mounting tension with some pleasant diversion...<br /><br />guy madison and frank lovejoy play the officers who rescue helen westcott and vera miles from the indians...<br /><br />the outdoor scenes are well photographed, specially the exciting indian charge at feather river at the climax of the movie with the rain of spears, the fight to-the-death between madison and thunderhawk, the sketches of the guardhouse brigade, even a mouthful of tobacco juice used against a rattlesnake, and the romantic interludes between our hero and helen westcott... all are here, pictorially entertaining in 3-d and technicolor...
