*flat spoilers* <br /><br />five med students, nelson (kiefer sutherland), david labraccio (kevin bacon), rachel mannus (julia roberts), joe hurley (william baldwin) & randy steckle (oliver platt) decide to attempt an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage).<br /><br />almost everyone does this experiment, randy being the lone exception, but they begin to have unwelcome visitors; david sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him, joe sees all the women he has had sex with (and which he videotaped) asking him why from the tv screen, rachel relives her father's suicide and nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions.<br /><br />why are they here? and how will they get rid of them? this tense and interesting movie, set in an hallucinated city and into a gothic med school, is quite the experience, both for the story and the characters, played by then-budding stars such as kiefer sutherland, julia roberts, oliver platt, kevin bacon and william baldwin.<br /><br />the director is joel schumacher, who had already worked with sutherland in 'lost boys', and this second cooperation is even better than the first.<br /><br />a must for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs), this is one of the minor classics from the '80s that get respect even today, like the mention by rebecca gayheart in 'scream 2' or the tru calling episode which used the movie's premise.<br /><br />flatliners: 9/10.
