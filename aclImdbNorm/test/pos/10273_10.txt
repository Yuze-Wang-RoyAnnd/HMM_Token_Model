this is easily my favourite film. a tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel at the end in one fantastic rush. sheer brilliance.<br /><br />i'd love to see some more of gilles mimouni's work, but at least according to imdb, he hasn't made any other features. has the high quality of this work made producing another too daunting a task? has he moved (back) into some other sphere of creative endeavour? i certainly hope this won't be his final feature but i can't really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films.
