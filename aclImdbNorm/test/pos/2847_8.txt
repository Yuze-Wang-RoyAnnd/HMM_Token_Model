well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. this movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. but they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. i just about threw up, but i guess that's just me. greg kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. he has the ability to perform those over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. his scenes with betty seem like something out of "sleepless in seattle" or some other romantic comedy like that. you almost forget that morgan freeman and chris rock are searching betty down. morgan freeman's fascination with betty was rather creepy, considering that he could practically be her grandfather, but the scenes where he is conversing with her photograph are definitely worth a few laughs! chris rock's performance seems rather wooden, but he has his moments. renee zellweger is so sweet as betty, the lovable waitress with the crude, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. it's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go along with it! her roommate, rosa, shines as well, as a woman who cares about betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with betty's sickness. and, lastly, there is crispin glover. as a fan of his, i, naturally, thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more. no one else has the same style of acting that crispin has, and the argument between chris rock, crispin, and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious. i guess i'm saying that i liked this movie quite a bit! if you can stomach blood, violence, and a lot of foul language, it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs!
