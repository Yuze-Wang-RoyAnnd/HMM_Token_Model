i saw this movie on tv and loved it! i am a real disaster film fan, and this one was great. the cast was made of some really interesting people. connie selleca is always great. and william devane is in a league of his own. he can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can. the story line is great too. the thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen, and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea. and this movie brings it out in such a way that is almost totally believable.
