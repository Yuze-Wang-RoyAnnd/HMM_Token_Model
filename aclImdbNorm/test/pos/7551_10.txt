four friends was first billed on hbo in 82 as a sleeper hit. having heard the term 'sleeper' when 14, back then - i was anxious to see one. (!) boy - was i surprised! that film! i hadn't really fallen in love with a non-special effects film outside of treasure of the sierra madre - much less a 'hippy flick'...but having had grown up with a couple of hippies - i understood the power behind mr. penn's film. four friends is definitely one of a kind. the script is so personable - and that cast!!! craig wasson defines danilo prozor so well! he just personifies the 'writer type' to a tee - both smart and clumsy (the scene at the window...) and strong yet so very vulnerable. for me - he captures what it's like to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decade...and i have always found solace in the character - and in the film. throughout the 80's four friends was a partner in crime to me - and i caught the movie whenever i could on hbo - even if i had to stay up until 5am! and still, always at the end - there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach. jodi thelen personifies "that girl" to the hilt - it is so hard not to be charmed by her. this movie really stands the test of time. every once and a while i check out my video of it...or show a friend...and it still gets a solid reaction. i've known women who absolutely fall in love with georgia! so many levels..! just an incredible little 60's piece of humanity. very special, very magical. i recently found the novelization of four friends by robert grossbach - and it's even more detailed that the movie! actual dates of events, etc. a real find! and what's more - haha - i found the novel while thumbing around in a used book store...in omaha, ne of all places!!! guess you have to have an eye for her! when i was in l.a. in 92 working as an extra - i went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop - and there were a ton of stills from the film!!! unfortunately - i was broke and couldn't indulge...but boy, those photos of georgia and the guys all together just went right through me! i met director joe sergant on the set of skylark in emporia, ks in summer of 92...and we spoke about four friends - very cool! also...working at a video store in omaha in 98 - waited on a female who was a relative of jim metzler..! told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in omaha who was just fanatical about the film - and had gotten the utmost out of it. once again - the movie captures everything that's in danilo's character's heart...great, great work --- one of mssrs tesich and penn's finest efforts. steve tesich is sorely missed. an incredible writer.
