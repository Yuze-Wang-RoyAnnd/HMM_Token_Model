compared to battle of britain, this is a real film, with real characters and a real plot. battle of britain is basically a documentary with the occasional lawrence olivier and michael caine, but the real protagonists are the spits, the hurricanes, etc. here, on the other hand, you have two well-wrought characters (actually three) and a real plot. i strongly recommend it to anybody, even to those who are not particularly fond of war movies. it's well filmed, and i wonder what the director might do if he had the big capitals behind him. and i do not think that it's over-sentimental. it's only that in the fighters you have real people, with real feelings and a real life--as real as any fictional life in any great film.
