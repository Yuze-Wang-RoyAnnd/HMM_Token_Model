andy lau and lau ching-wan are both superb in johnny to's tautly directed crime thriller which puts most western efforts to shame. think of it as the hong kong 'heat', only better! everything about the film screams class; from the performances to the soundtrack, the cinematography to the script. the tone remains serious throughout, but the film has a nice line in black-humour, friendship and romance at it's heart. sure, it gets a little preposterous later on, but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who didn't find something to love about this movie. thank god, hollywood hasn't (yet) re-made and ruined a classic. do yourself a favour and see this film!
