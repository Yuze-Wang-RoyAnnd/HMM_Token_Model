endearingly silly anime, only six episodes in duration, about a hapless delivery boy called kintaro (well, he's called a delivery boy, though he is meant to be in his 20's), and the adventures he has on his travels. each episode sees him arriving in a new town, acquiring a new job, developing something of a love interest before each episode ends with him leaving.<br /><br />gently sexist, juvenile, very immature at times, this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face.<br /><br />not one to start with if you are not a fan of anime, as this certainly won't convince you about the genre, but for those who are already converted, this is entertaining fluff.
