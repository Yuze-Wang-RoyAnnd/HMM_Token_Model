although copies of this movie are hard to find, if you can find it, get it!! !!! i believe this was, aside from in the navy, abbott and costello's only musical. although they twisted the plot around a little, (i've never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him), you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but lovable jack, and the greedy butcher, mr. dinklepuss. slightly reminiscent of dubarry was a lady, this uproarious film will have you rolling on the floor - only to get up and dance as lou costello sings. (i don't know why they didn't do that in other films.)
