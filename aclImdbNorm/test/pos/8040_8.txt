it worked! director christian duguay created a very clever action/spy thriller. the actors donald sutherland and especially aidan quinn gave a top performance. what a pity that we couldn't see aidan quinn in others movies like this one till now. he was simply the best in the role as ramirez/carlos for what he should have earned the oscar. the picture was very nice. the scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story doesn't let you a chance to get bored. the movie is too underrated and i recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great. believe me you will not be disappointed. that's why i give it 9/10.
