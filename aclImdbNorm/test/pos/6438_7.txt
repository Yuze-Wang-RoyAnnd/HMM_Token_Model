like many, i first saw the water babies as a child/young teen in the late seventies/early eighties. it has remained with me since then with its catchy tunes, memorable portrayals, less-then-successful animation, and a story full of heart, coldness, and ultimately good vanquishing evil. recently i sat down and saw it again after at least two decades passing, and i noticed this time around its striking similarities to the wizard of oz. no, these aren't blatant likenesses but hear me out. in this one we have a boy and his dog - having personal problems at "home," running away from something and in the scene right after they run away, changing the substance of their appearance. in this one, the boy and dog become animated. in the wizard of oz, dorothy and toto are in color. in this one, the boy and dog are told they must find the water babies for answers and then ultimately the kracken for guidance and he has the ability to let tom go home if he shows he has courage, etc... in the wizard of oz, dorothy must also find an authoritative figure that tests her before he will allow her to return home. in the water babies, tom meets three characters that will help him on his journey to the water babies - dorothy has three helpers as well. when each helper is met, we are entertained with a rendering of "hi, hi, hi, hi, hi cockallorum...we're on our way." in the wizard it is "we're off to see the wizard." dorothy has a good witch sort of look after her; tom has a woman with many roles(billie whitelaw) do the same. if you look closely at the two, there are many other likenesses. that being said, the water babies is not a knockoff in any way, i was just commenting on the eerie likes between the two. this film has some solid performances from bad guys bernard cribbins and the always fascinating james mason. the kids playing tom and ella are good. the supporting cast of joan greenwood(love her voice!), david tomlinson, and the vocal talents of john pertwee and lance percival add greatly to the mix. i must confess that the animation is less than sterling even for its time but is adequate enough to the challenge. the three animated characters that help tom get home are all likable. i always have trouble picking my favorite between the french swordfish and the john inman/mr. humphries like seahorse. the scene where we hear this guttural, maniacal laugh from a shipwrecked vessel only to see a seahorse with a huge polka-dotted bow-tie bob out always has me rolling! the water babies is a lot of fun. sure, it is more of a children's film, but it has and always shall have a fond place in my heart. the bulk of the credit for what successes the film does have must go to director lionel jeffries. jeffries is a wonderful comedic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident throughout.
