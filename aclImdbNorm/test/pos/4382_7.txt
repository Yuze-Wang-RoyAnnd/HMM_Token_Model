after seeing the 'oh so acclaimed' fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average, i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen 'masterpiece'. this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney. well done mr. clooney, make more of these and less 'perfect stormish' movies. you can act and you showed it here.<br /><br />7 out of 10
