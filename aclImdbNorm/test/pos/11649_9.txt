if you think about it, it's nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty (one of the world's most controversial topics) that offends neither those for nor against. it's a testament to tim robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well (shawshank redemption, jacob's ladder).<br /><br />this film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the "for" and "against" camps... so subtle that it can't be put into words, subtle to the point of vanishing, yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible, that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough...
