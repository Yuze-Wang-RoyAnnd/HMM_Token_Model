some time ago i saw this when hbo was showing it and from what i saw of it, it seemed like a good movie. so i'm in blockbuster today and i see it there with the dvd's and i decide what the hell. so i rent it. after i finished watching it i was in shock of how good it was.<br /><br />this movie just touched my heart. everything in it was so amazing. the stories, the actors, the dark humor, the music!!! oh don't get me started on the music in this film. pt andderson is one of the greats. definitely the best thing to come out since quentin tarantino(a god.)<br /><br />after i finished the first viewing i watched it again with anderson's commentary (i was suprised on how such a cool guy he is.)<br /><br />anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie, if they haven't already. anderson is obviously a film lover. in the movie he rips off so many other directors tecniques. such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. obviously ripped off from "i am cuba." but i have no beef what so ever with that. the film is very respectable with it's ripoff's.<br /><br />i recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film(porn.)<br /><br />10/10
