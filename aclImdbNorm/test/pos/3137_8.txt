in crystal city, a group of mormons hire the horse traders travis (ben johnson) and sandy (harry carey jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to san juan river. along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack dr. a. locksley hall (alan mowbray) and the prostitutes denver (joanne dru) and fleuretty phyffe (ruth clifford). then the sadistic outlaws clegg boys decide to join the mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the sheriff of crystal city that is chasing them. when the navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party. when the wagon train is near to their destination, the clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing sandy and travis to take an attitude.<br /><br />"wagon master" is another great western of john ford. the sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. the adventure of the group of mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "caravana dos bravos" ("caravan of the braves")
