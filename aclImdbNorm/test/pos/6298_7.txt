i've read that paolo sorrintino's inspiration for the consequences of love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a brazilian hotel, and speculating what he might be doing there. the film unfolds to us in a similar way. we view the existence of titta who has lived alone in a hotel in switzerland for 8 years. he is secretive and avoids friendship. his life is dominated by order and regularly. gradually, the truth of his existence is revealed to us until, finally, his world begins to fall apart.<br /><br />the mystery of titta is central to the consequences of love and it works thanks in large part to the superb performance by toni servillo. his character becomes all the more intriguing to us as little details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week, that he has no imagination. although some here criticise the dialogue for not being naturalistic, that doesn't matter in my view - this is not that sort of film, and i think the script is great. the camera work is also excellent.<br /><br />if you have to criticise, the film does lose its way a in the later scenes as the mystery of titta's existence is revealed to us, and as his world begins to fall apart. however, the tragic final scenes are every bit as good as the earlier build-up.
