i say remember where and when you saw this show because i believe if fox gives talk show a chance spike will be right up there with conan in a few years because like conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor.<br /><br />the funniest bits spike has had so far are the idiot paparatzi and comedy for stoners and if your not high and get cfs what does that say about you. <br /><br />in summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than snl in an hour so lets hope talk show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour, more money and a band.
