i think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain or to inform. if you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies. sometimes these are one of the same. the other side of the coin is to entertain. did hitch entertain me? yes it did. okay the formula is standard. boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls. they get together have a falling out then get back together. however the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. i particularly liked the bar scene with hitch and sara. the allegra albert romance was a delight to watch unfold, most real men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and had i had hitch's advice i would probably have got my wife up the altar in half the time.i read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs. i tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. besides relationships have there serious moments. all in all i found hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (i will be looking out for them in other movies) and hitch is a film that i am very happy to have in my dvd collection.
