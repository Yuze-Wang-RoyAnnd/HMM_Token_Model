this film is amazing, while not perfect by hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor, black and white that is true in many parts of the world. it handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems. the children are beautiful, take special note of the young man who plays sipho. the friendships that develop are universally true, anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make. the influence of adults is interesting - it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snip-its of conversations and interactions-much like a child would remember experiencing. i would highly recommend this film.
