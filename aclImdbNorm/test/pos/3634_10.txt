i rented this movie, but i wasn't too sure what to expect of it. i was very glad to find that it's about the best brazilian movie i've ever seen. the story is rather odd and simple, and above all, extremely original. we have antonio, who is a young man living in nordestina, a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of brazil, and who is deeply in love with karina. the main conflict between the two is that, while antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it, karina wants to see the world and resents the place. as a prove of his love for her, he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her. he'll put nordestina in the map, as he says. and the way he does it is unbelievable. this is a good movie; might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job, but i think that it's also that that improves the story. it's just fun, and it makes you feel good.
