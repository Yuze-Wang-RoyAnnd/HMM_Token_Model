another good animation from disney. sequels are not always that great and tend to follow the same plot as the original. however, the son of tramp tries to savor the world out side the home and family he knows and learns where he actually belongs. being a junkyard dog is not for everyone, er dog that is, but scamp overcomes adversity. the voices of the various characters were superb and provided by several well know actors such as scott wolf, alyssa milano and mickey rooney. entertaining and a well made family movie.
