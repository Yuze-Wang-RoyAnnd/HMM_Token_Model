i don't know if i'd go as far as to say that this movie belongs to the 'aussie trash' pile, but it's fair to say that there are no academy award nominees here. what must be considered is that most of the actors in this film weren't actually actors as such, just kids with nothing better to do at the time. there were many others that were offered roles in the film but turned them down to go surfing up the coast; all things taken into account, it really wasn't a bad movie for its time. in some respects it's really not unlike today's times, where peer pressure is still alive and kicking, just without the mobile phones, computers and other similar gadgets that kids lived without, unlike this generation. anyway, i have to rate this flick as an old fave that i watch once in a blue moon and never take too seriously...
