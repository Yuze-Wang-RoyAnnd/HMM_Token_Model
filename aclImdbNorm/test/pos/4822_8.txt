this has no relationship to virtual encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. the two videos just share the general concept of people having simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. so if you were really blown away by the story and dialog in vc 1 (yeah, right), and expecting a continuation in vc 2, just be warned. all the actors and actresses are new, but it has the same excellent director, sybil richards.<br /><br />but like vc 1, you get lots of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the envelope of soft core just about as far as it can go.<br /><br />if you have vc 1 and you liked it, you'll like vc 2. if you don't have either, but like really good softcore sex, get both.
