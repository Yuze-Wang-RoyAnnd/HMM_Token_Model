a crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, catherine deane (jennifer lopez) who is desperately urged by two fbi agents, peter novak (vince vaughn) and gordon ramsey (jake weber) to use her therapy on carl stargher (vincent d'ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. what novak wants in return from deane is whereabouts of stargher's latest victim is and if she's alive. once deane gets into stargher's mind, which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of david lynch's "dune" or "blue velvet" and wes craven's "a nightmare on elm street", the adventure begins. deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from carl as a youngster (an adorable jake thomas) to a freddy krueger-like man minus the razor claws. i don't want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, howard shore's creepy musical score and directing (by tarsem, who shows here that he can direct).
