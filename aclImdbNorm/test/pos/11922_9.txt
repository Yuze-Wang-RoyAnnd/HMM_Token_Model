this is one worth watching, although it is sometimes cheesy, it is great to see a young sean astin, and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie. i watched it many times when i was young, and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine (i happen to own a copy). so sit back with this movie, let reality go for a little while, and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half.
