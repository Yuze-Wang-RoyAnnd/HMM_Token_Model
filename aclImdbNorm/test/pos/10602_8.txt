when i first heard of this movie, i was mildly interested. the plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and bam margera as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good. when i found out the movie starred ryan dunn, i was even further interested (i was a fan of homewrecker when it was on... yeah, i'm that lame). however, i didn't have much faith in it being to good. when i sat down to watch it, i was afraid i was wasting my time.<br /><br />but even just five minutes it it became apparent that i'd been wrong.<br /><br />i thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic, and definitely not suited for all kinds of people. the acting was rather good, much better than my expectations. i thought that it was rather easy to relate to ryan's character, which gave the movie a center that was believable. this is key in a movie as outrageous as this (and is probably why i was not a fan of borat).<br /><br />the movie is not suitable at all for younger people, duh, and will definitely create more than it's fair share of awkward turtles if watched with parents. but it's a good one for you and your buddies on a movie night.
