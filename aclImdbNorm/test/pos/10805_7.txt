i was very curious to see this wajda-depardieu outing, plus the time period is definitely fascinating. being a wajda fan, i was disappointed, and that may be an understatement. the film never really took cinematic flight -- there's no foundation for the animosity between danton and robespierre, etc.<br /><br />basically, the script was weak (adapted from "the danton affair"). and yet, the direction was masterful...it's wajda, afterall! also, there were some amazing actors but they never really grab the audience's attention like they should. depardieu comes off as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant danton...not exactly the image we have in mind. woijech pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can't break down. andrzej seweryn and bogoslaw linda pop up ... as bourdon and saint-just...and if you're familiar with wajda, then you'd know them.<br /><br />overall, i was disappointed with this much-lauded film. great cast, great director, but no quality foundation. bad, undynamic script. we need to get in danton (walesa) and robespierre's (general j) mindsets... what are their motivations? eh...who knows? one likes women, the other powders himself? riiight. ok, so if you're looking for a great french revolution movie i highly recommend "la revolution francaise"...it's in two parts and oh-so-great! excellent performances, in-depth script, juicy tid bits...definitely a satisfying experience!! klaus-maria brandauer is a much better danton than depardieu...the wonderful andrzej seweryn apparently took some notes from "danton" and is brilliant as robespierre. see it! now! as for wajda fans -- you're better off with "man of iron/marble", "promised land", and the like. cheers!!
