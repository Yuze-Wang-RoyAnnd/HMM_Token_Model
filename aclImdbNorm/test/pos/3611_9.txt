'captain corelli's mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. it is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. the views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! nicolas cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. i think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. louis de bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon. go and see this film with an open mind-you'll love it; because underneath is the touching story of love and war.
