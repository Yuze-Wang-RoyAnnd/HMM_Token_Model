i just watched "return from lonesome dove" and it was very good! i've seen a lot of negative comments about it and i don't think the viewers are being real about it! in the television/ movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a 2nd sequel or 3rd part. we are lucky to have another miniseries that ties into lone d. faithfully!! this production was top notch with the original music score, and the actors put their hearts into it(you can tell). if you want to watch lonesome d. with robert duvall and tommy l. j. then watch the original. return to l.d. didn't have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less. from the touching moments to the villains, this one is a winner! "wonderful!!!"
