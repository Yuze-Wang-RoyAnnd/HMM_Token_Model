just as in "columbo" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. what follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. the investigating officer, adam arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike "columbo". it is william h. macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime". william h. macy fans will enjoy "a slight case of murder", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities. add some well timed comedy, and this is very similar to a fine episode of "columbo". highly recommended. - merk
