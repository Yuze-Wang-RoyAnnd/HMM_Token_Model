this 1955 producers' showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast, including kathleen nolan as wendy, who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play. it's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which doesn't even show up in the imdb listings when you put "peter pan" into the search engine! - is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched. i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally. now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison. i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b/w producers' showcase televised version.<br /><br />as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo. how far away the 1950's seem now - such an innocent time compared to today. i miss it.
