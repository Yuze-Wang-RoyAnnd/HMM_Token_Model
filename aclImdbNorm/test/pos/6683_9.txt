in kpax softley brushes on the subtleties of eastern religious mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of prot. spacey (prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film - it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in buddhism and hinduism. it can be said that prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is 'bright' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but prot sees truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly.<br /><br />the film is particularly detailed, therefore i would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how softley interjects nuances. listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies.<br /><br />9 of out 10 rating - superb - with nominal room for improvement.
