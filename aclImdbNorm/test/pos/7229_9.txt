in the seedy streets somewhere in new york city, a lonely punk named tromeo ( will keenan) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time. he does fall for a beautiful rich girl named juliet ( jane jenson) whom is also troubled as her father is being quite an abusive son of a you know what, but as our title characters meet and fall for each other things start becoming quite magical for them. unfortunately their fathers are at each other as juliet's dad wants to take over tromeo's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud? <br /><br />hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and disgusting people at troma is a wonderful modern day take on william shakespeare's romeo and juliet. this was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for this is a dark humored satire of the legendary story that started it all, it's got some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore such as a head being smashed on a fire hydrant. for me this is the third best troma movie next to the immortal "toxic avenger" and "troma's war" being second, yes the acting can be a little bad like some troma flicks but the stuff above makes it up for that and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, peter jackson, and troma or if you wanna see a comical version of a beloved story, btw also look for a couple of amusing appearances by the toxic avenger and sgt. kabukiman nypd.<br /><br />also recommended: "the toxic avenger", "meet the feebles", "ichi the killer", " re-animator", "terror firmer", "class of nuke'em high", "romeo and juliet ( 1968 and 1996)", " pieces", " troma's war", " citizen toxie: the toxic avenger 4", "basket case", " riki-oh: the story of ricky", " demons", "new nightmare", " freddy vs. jason", " cabin fever", "nightmare on elm street", " battle royale", " pink flamingos", " perfect blue", " rabid grannies", "surf nazis must die", " hostel", " evil dead ii", "serial mom", " dead alive ( a.k.a. braindead)", " street trash".
