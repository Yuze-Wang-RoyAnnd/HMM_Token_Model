simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often skipped over in feel good movies. i saw this as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again.<br /><br />as a child it sparked my interest purely for the building of a plane, as an adult it captured me in the dark world and a young mans escape from that world. <br /><br />the portrayal of the king was great, the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was i thought well done, i personally can not recall anything quite done in that style and adds to the character and portrays him as a force almost not human (which may not be far from reality) it makes for interesting developments <br /><br />worth a watch any day
