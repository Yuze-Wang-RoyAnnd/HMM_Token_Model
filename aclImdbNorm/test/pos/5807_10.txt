well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia,pa sometime in june of 06.and i really loved it.my all time favorite madonna look was the 1990 blond ambition tour era.this to me is "madonna".now that she is a mother of 3 she has to change some things to suit motherhood.and i totally agree.this is a classic madonna concert.i wish "live to tell" wasn't edited.we saw body's falling from buildings on 911,we can see a woman on a cross...any way i'm looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage.she is a artist of all time.the best out there...and still at the top and going strong.long live madonna !
