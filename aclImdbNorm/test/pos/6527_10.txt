this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling . as a teenage singer in america,aaron is not as pop as before,most americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didn't know how to rap.but attention,everyone,he is a kid,how many people can understand him.being a pop fan is difficult,and being a pop star is more difficult.i think this time aaron(jd) has shows something real to us.and i think people should learn to understand each other. at another hand,i like the music in the film very much.i remember the first song appeared in the film is "saturday night" and it also include some aaron's real live show,and the second one is "one better",so i think if you enjoy this film,maybe you'll be a pop fan,too. at last,i hope you will have a great time^^ a voice from a chinese boy.
