twenty years after watching this, i still find myself quoting things from this movie like "look between the two giant melons", or i'll start to sing the "pabst blue ribbon theme". on the other hand, 20 years later, i can now make sense of the "meat machine", as there's still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie. those are signs of a good movie to me. i could say this movie stands the test of time, which i can't really say for a lot of 80's movies. i continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of people's favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80's. if you like games, and have dreams of becoming a "game master", or find yourself dorking out over these 80's movies to relive your childhood, you need to watch this. also, it's sometimes sarcastic, and funny. but one thing's for certain about this movie, if someone ever invites you to a "great all-nighter" they don't mean an x or acid trip party, they mean, get ready for some midnight madness! oh, you'll see. everyone will be dying to play! hehehehheh.
