i can never figure if this is the artiest soap opera ever produced, or the soapiest art movie. no matter, john seale's cinematogaphy is utterly ravishing. ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, elevated to film. if there is a fault, it is in the original novel, not in anthony minghella's beautiful movie. anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book, and probably cannot read. i do not like repeating adjectives, but ravishing serves the purpose. <br /><br />apart from the storyline, the players excel. but it is the australian sense of light and shade that ultimately triumphs. like some antipodean dutch master, seale uses a blast of light, where van rijn would have used shade. one could weep for cinematography this magnificent.
