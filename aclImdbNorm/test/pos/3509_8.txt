the cover of the vhs says it all: "without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the texas chainsaw massacre". i'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and i have to say, i agree 100 %. the characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially george kennedy as the forest-ranger). there's the twisted atmosphere, that only tcm has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. this has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror films of all time! jeff lieberman as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works (blue sunshine, wrong turn) added, he must be one of the most underrated directors in the filmindustry today.
