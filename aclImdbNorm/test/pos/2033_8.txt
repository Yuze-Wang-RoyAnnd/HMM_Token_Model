i must admit i wasn't expecting much on this movie. i was surprised i truly enjoyed it as much as i did. the script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. the acting was great by mark wahlberg. jennifer aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. what made this movie for me was the music. if you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie. its all about being a rockstar. some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all. i would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to stand up and shout!!! 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music.<br /><br />jason
