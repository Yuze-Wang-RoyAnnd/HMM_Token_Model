i'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film. if you don't like this movie for what it is - a silly, over-the-top, mob story - then you are simply reading too much into it. this film is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape "the life" and the troubles that follow her. michelle pfeiffer is terrificly 80's 'jersey, who is an uncertain, uncomfortable mob wife while matthew modine is an anal retentive-like mob tracking cop who falls for her. the plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and mercedes ruel steals the show as the queen of mob wives. if you aren't looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80's cult classic. you won't be able to stop watching if you start.
