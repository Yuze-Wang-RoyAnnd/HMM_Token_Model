i don't understand why critics would bash this movie. it's a teen movie that's actually serious, which is a rarity. i'll admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy, but c'mon it's about young love, it's gotta be sappy to be valid. my biggest complaint is chris klein. while he was funny in american pie, he apparently isn't ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet, he's very uncomfortable looking in some of his "mama stuff". hartnett and sobieski on the other hand, demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability, as do the parent's. although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers spouting off poetry, the actor's make it work. the directing sports some powerful images on the screen. beautiful cinematography, nice music, great young actors, i was impressed and i'm a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies.
