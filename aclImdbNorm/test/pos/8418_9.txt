i am a maharashtrian, a teenager living in the 21st century, and its obvious that i'm not much into even bollywood, let alone marathi movies. yet, when i watched shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling, one which only an extremely effective movie is capable of generating.<br /><br />it is a fact that, like most indian movies, the movie has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language. a lot of the emotion and meaning of the movie is embedded in its marathi dialogues, which, however hard one tries, can not be effectively translated into english.<br /><br />shwaas explores, in intricate detail, the relationship between a grandparent and a child. and it does complete justice to this strong bond. dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe"(my parsha is also one in a million) enhance the emotion. anyone who has closely observed the grandparent - child relationship will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />overall, it definitely worth watching. its a movie that has left a profound effect on me. i will surely recommend it to anyone!
