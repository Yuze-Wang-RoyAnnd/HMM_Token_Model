i never thought i'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning kenji miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, i'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--miyazawa wrote a children's book called night on the galactic railroad). however, this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who "sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful.<br /><br />all this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (like in many of miyazawa's stories).<br /><br />some of the visuals are truly astounding, especially considering that it was a made for tv movie. seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds trailing blue light) rival parts of fantasia. however, i still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation. the cgi trains are horribly obvious--even more so than the anastasia train.<br /><br />8/10
