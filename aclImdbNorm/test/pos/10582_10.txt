alright, let me break it down for ya... haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you'll ever see. it's got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie, basically, if you've seen jackass or the cky series, you'd know what to expect for humor, considering it has most of the people from those movies. overall... i just had to give it a 10/10 because its one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />~f0rs4k3n<br /><br />(p.s.) haggard rules!
