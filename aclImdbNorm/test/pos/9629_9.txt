the patriot is a well thought out, well produced film, that will draw the viewer into the story directly, and keep them involved to the very end. granted, it is not in the same vein as under siege, et. al., but this is definitely the trademark film of what might be described as seagal's second era of films. not so much action movies with a nod to a story thrown in for good measure, but a good story, matched with a point, and injected with some of seagal's unimitable action sequences. is this the kind of film that hardcore action junkies will enjoy? probably not. but for those of us who not only like our action, but also can appreciate a well told story, this is a big step forward for seagal. it's almost like the transformation clint eastwood made as he tried to step out from underneath the shadow of his "dirty harry" series. either man, had he continued in the singular direction they were headed, would have forever been keyholed in in specific role and guaranteed the brevity of their careers...
