viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles. i give the nod to garbo(but not by much)in regard to her naturalness. robeson is majestic. but his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater. something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities. there hadn't been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like anna and brutus to take the foreground. these were very progressive films for their time. it's quite probable that o'neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america.
