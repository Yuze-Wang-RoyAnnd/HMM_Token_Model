a remake of the 1916 silent film, based on the 1909 novel by maurice leblanc. the detective series would be made into numerous plays, films and tv series in the uk, the us, and france over the years. this 1932 version starred the smashing barrymore brothers john (as the duke) and lionel (as detective guerchard). they would also star together in grand hotel, dinner at eight, and several others over the next couple years. sonia (karen morley) shows up in the duke's bed during a party in this pre-hayes code film; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then they go out in the main ballroom, then the search is on for the crook and the missing jewelry, as well as other missing valuables... you can tell talkies hadn't been around too long, as they still use caption cards several times. also watch for a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination. well-thought- out plot, no big holes, but no big surprises here either. not bad for an early talkie film. clever ending.
