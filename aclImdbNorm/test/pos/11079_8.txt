take a young liberal idealist christopher boyce (timothy hutton) put in a top secret classification in a government front company because of his father's position team him up with a no'count drug dealer daulton lee (sean penn) who is wanted by the police and needs a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage. sean penn played the part of the punk drug dealer with a certain sang froid probably out of particular verisimilitude with such raunchy types. the gall penn carries with him in every situation is unique; he even suggests the soviets run drugs for him.<br /><br />i've seen the movie over and over again and each time i see something new. it seems to me that a major problem with us spy organizations is its inbreeding which leads to the hiring of an obviously unsuitable candidate by reason of temperament and inclination for a government front company.<br /><br />i do recall when the falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities on a wild goose chase. i see that despite the escape he is now released. a pity the soviets are no longer around to accept the wretch! a cheery cherio!
