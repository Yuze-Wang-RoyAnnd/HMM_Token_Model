the main point of the movie, imo, is the fact the joanna's whole life has been nothing but a series of facades. the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots, and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box. what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband. if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one, one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life.<br /><br />when joanna accidentally hits cory, she leaves the scene to call the police. by the time she returns, the police and ambulance are there, as well as people from her community, remarking "what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there?" well-respected in her community, she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done. but, she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades...<br /><br />great movie-i have seen it many times!
