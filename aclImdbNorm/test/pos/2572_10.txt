i suppose this is what is called southern gothic.<br /><br />it stars samuel l. jackson, christina ricci, and also justin timberlake is featured in a role. timberlake does good work, much to my surprise, i didn't expect it of him.<br /><br />when you're lost and you can't find your way home--that's the black snake moan.<br /><br />the people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain.<br /><br />samuel l. jackson plays a blues singer/musician--whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother, along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her.<br /><br />christina ricci's character is a woman who was sexually abused when young--this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to treat her badly.<br /><br />the story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives. it is a love story, but not a sexual love story, between them--the older black man and the young white woman.<br /><br />it is different from most films hollywood grinds out.<br /><br />i highly recommend it.<br /><br />10 stars
