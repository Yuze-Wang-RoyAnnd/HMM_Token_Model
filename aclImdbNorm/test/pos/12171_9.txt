i gave 9 of 10 points. i was sitting in tears nearly the whole movie, because i had to laugh!<br /><br />the story of course wasn't excellent, but it also wasn't boring. erkan & stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful nina. while doing this job they come between the "front-lines" of bnd and cia. of course the two are neither born bodyguards nor gentlemen, so they run from one disaster into another; and they do this in such a funny way, that when you watch some scenes you won't be able to stop the tears! as actors those two "dumbly grinning" characters do quite well, better than some so called professional.<br /><br />you think, the speech of the two heroes is curios or "pseudo-foreign"? well, if you hear quite a lot turkish-german people in munich speaking exactly like them, you will remember erkan & stefan. and maybe, in 10 years it might have become the common speech of the youth. (god forbid!)<br /><br />so, if you like to laugh, watch this movie!
