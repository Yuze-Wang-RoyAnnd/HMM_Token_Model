there are one or two other shemp-era shorts i like more (i.e. scrambled brains), but i think one can say--without much argument--that in this particular episode, shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946.<br /><br />scene for scene, this episode hardly lets up: from professor shemp howard's voice lessons with the glass-shattering dee green, to his futile attempts to win a dame's hand in marriage (this is your little snookums... will you marry me *click*) to the uproarious finish, it never fails to keep me in stitches.<br /><br />i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins (the always lovely christine mcintyre). btw, isn't she rather under-dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her 'cousin' basil? who knows, maybe the actual basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (as far as i know). >:-]
