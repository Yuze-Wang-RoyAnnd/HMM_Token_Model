i too must apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this endeavor as i contributed to the soundtrack. still i received my copy, sat back and enjoyed the rolling cast of characters who were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this tale of a film sequel shanghai. for those who feel george bush is a "credible texan", one need look no further than this film to shatter the image that texas is full of truck driving, one-dimensional rednecks. the cast contains some of the most intelligent, peculiar and humorous folks you'll find anywhere as they spin their tales of agony, bliss and disappointment in going for a great film sequel, no budget, guerilla style (i.e. "punk rock style" as each person helps define).<br /><br />this is a great documentary made with passion and guts and all the venom you'll need to break through to the other side of whatever industry b.s. and doublespeak you're dealing with (take note authors, painters, musicians and fellow filmmakers). it hearkens back to the credibility of the first wave of american hardcore music when the term "d.i.y." was the standard, a period where courage, passion and commitment mattered way more than technique, style or precious calculations. not that there isn't plenty of technique or style to this...the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing. the editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialog therein.<br /><br />the idea of creating a documentary out of the sad demise of the cast, crew and director's initial intent is brilliant, totally texas and absolutely punk rock. in the truest sense of the term.
