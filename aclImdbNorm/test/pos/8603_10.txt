black rain is a superb film, but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as $300 apiece. i have the dvd, and it's terrible. very tiny non-anamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolution-killing size. acceptable sound. this is a primitive dvd that absolutely *has* to be rereleased.<br /><br />btw, i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain. the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd! and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them all
