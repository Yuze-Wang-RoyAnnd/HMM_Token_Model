tonino valerii's "il prezzo del potere" aka. "the price of power" is an excellent and enthralling spaghetti western that mirrors the kennedy assassination. a great leading performance by giuliano gemma and an excellent score by luis bacalof are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie.<br /><br />in 1881 texas is divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to reinstall the confederacy. in spite of warnings, president james garfield, who wants to establish a new policy of equality, decides to visit dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning his assassination. bill willer (giuliano gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named jack donovan (ray shaunders), and a crippled guy named nick (manuel zarzo) are determined to prevent the president's murder. <br /><br />since james garfield was not assassinated by racists, who wanted to reinstall the confederacy in texas, but in washington dc by mentally unstable charles guiteau, the storyline of "price of power" is, of course, historical nonsense. since the movie, however, doesn't claim historical accuracy, but tries to allude to the 1963 kennedy assassination in dallas, the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. <br /><br />giuliano gemma delivers an excellent performance as the main character bill willer, benito stefanelli is great as the villainous and corrupt sheriff jefferson. some other good performances are those of ray shaunders as bill's black friend jack, warren vanders as arthur mcdonald, the president's adviser, and fernando rey as pinkerton, a villainous rich businessman. the score by luis enr'iquez bacalov is great, the cinematography and locations are great and (such as in valerii's earlier "day of anger") remind a lot of sergio leone, for whom valerii used to work as an assistant director for "a fistful of dollars" and "for a few dollars more". <br /><br />all said, "il prezzo del potere" is, after "day of anger", another excellent spaghetti western that shows both the great talent of giuliano gemma as an actor and tonino valerii as a director. "the price of power" is a must-see for spaghetti western fans, and i also highly recommend it to everybody else. 8/10
