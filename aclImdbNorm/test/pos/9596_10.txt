i caught this filmshow about the most unlikely, success? ,from a lower league, football team. the plot is thick and roles out some great tenuous twists and turns. intercut with shots and commentary from the 70's .i was taken aback by its shear footy fun.<br /><br />a great cast includes the excellent tim healy as the crazed(drunk) manager , bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win...? i keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that don revie( super leeds united and england manager-loved by the fans hated by everyone else)has on bostock united ( the underfelt men) which in its detailed report of their opposition, bostock united, in this the fa cup final, merely says "sh-te".<br /><br />lots of other footy gags a long time before the fantastic feature length "mike basset - football manager" starring ricky tomlinson.<br /><br />up there with the, gung ho english beating germans, at football. well morally.although the score lines says different , of "escape to victory" ( i still cheer when england score )<br /><br />and the thankless eternal grind of following a really bad team in micheal palins "golden gordon" from "ripping yarns" series ( with terry jones)the team were called bostonworth united ,in case your interested.<br /><br />i've looked high and low for a copy of bostock's cup-even nick hancock's biography doesn't list it ( probably someone -not mr hancocks- error)<br /><br />play it again or sell me a copy- please....
