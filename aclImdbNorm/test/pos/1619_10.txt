this is a low budget stop motion monster movie from brett (a nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell) piper... and it delivers just what i'd expect from such a production: light-hearted (though cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. that's why i've given the film 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what i expected it to deliver... and a bit more: brett doesn't penny-pinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen. he hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale. and, anyway, i love stop motion monsters which, compared to cgi critters in bigger budgeted movies, just seem to be that much fun to watch.
