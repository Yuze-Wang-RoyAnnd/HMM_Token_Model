disney's buena vista pictures presents a wonderfully told fact-based sports drama directed by actor bill paxton. photography is superb, but story sometimes lumbers along. this film is about the 20 year old amateur golfer francis ouimet(shia labeouf)and his competition in the 1913 u.s. open. what a story; a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best golfers of the time, including british champions harry vardon(stephen dillane)and ted ray(stephen marcus). a storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat. the cast also includes: peter firth, elias koteas, marnie mcphail, robin wilcox, and possibly stealing the show is josh flitter, who plays eddie lowery, ouimet's caddy and best friend.
