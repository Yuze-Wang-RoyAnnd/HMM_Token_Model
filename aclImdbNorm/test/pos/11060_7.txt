perhaps this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. the main roles seem more appropriate for clark gable and vivien leigh. i could care less about gary cooper, but ingrid bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. the movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast: flora robson is terrific as a mulatto servant. she is a white woman in blackface, and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress. jerry austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role, that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes. speaking of scenes, florence bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady. i didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure hollywood dreck. it's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!
