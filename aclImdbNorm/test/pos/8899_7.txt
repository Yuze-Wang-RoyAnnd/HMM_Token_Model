asterix and the vikings is the first animated asterix movie in over 12 years since the 1994 "asterix conquers america". it also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterix animation, which makes the largely entertaining story a lot more breathtaking to behold.<br /><br />every scene of this movie is vividly rendered in bright cheerful hues adhering closely to the color schemes of the comic books it was based on. the character designs also stick relatively close to the comic, for better or for worse, preserving the simple but unique look of the characters. being simple in terms of character design, this allows for more time and effort to be spent on the actual animation, which by the way surpasses many other big screen theatrical animated movies. character movements are very fluid and possess a quality that looks way beyond what a modest budget would usually produce; there is always something moving in every scene and no evidence of the usual cost cutting animation short cuts. 3d computer images are incorporated seamlessly with the traditionally animated 2d art. if anything, the style of shading makes the 3d elements look more like traditional comic book paintings than cgi models.<br /><br />the storyline takes much of its elements from the "asterix and the normans" comic, and this is where its main flaw lies. as an adaptation of said comic, "asterix and the vikings" takes way too many liberties with its source material. long time fans of the comic would no doubt find much to dislike about the movie's story and its lack of adherence to the source.<br /><br />on the other hand, one can see this story as a really fun one if taken on its own without comparing it its source material. highly comedic, well written jokes pepper the upbeat script. the funniest parts were the numerous pop culture references and jibes at modern day 21 century life. mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are spoofed to great effect. excellent chemistry and acting by the cast (i watched this in english by the way) though a couple of voices like cacofonix i found really irritating (but i guess it is all part of his character).<br /><br />if there is anything to criticize about the story, it is the lack of "asterix". this story seems to be more like justforkix's story of teenage romance and "coming of age" with asterix and obelix merely playing supporting roles. this gives a pretty big sense of staleness since much of the story's elements are the usual staples of such teen movies. derivative and clich'ed at times, only the witty comedy and traditional "astrix" elements (the romans, the pirates etc) manage to save this film from falling into plain mediocrity.<br /><br />while not the best installment in the asterix animated movie library, it is certainly one of the funniest, the best scripted and the most beautifully animated. dvd seems a little hard to come by though
