lou gossett, jr. is great as 'chappy sinclair', a super u.s. air force pilot who comes to the rescue of a nice but undisciplined 'doug masters' (jason gedrick), the son of a captured pilot who is determined to borrow a couple of f-16 fighters to use in an attempt to save his dad from a dictator (david suchet) of an enemy overseas country.<br /><br />better than 'top gun', this air force aviation film has excitement and lots of explosions - you know, all that cool stuff you'd want from a contemporary military adventure film.<br /><br />cool music including twisted sister's dee snider belting out 'we're not gonna take it' and king cobra's excellent 'never say die'.<br /><br />aim high! air force!
