sometimes, you're up late at night flipping through the stations, bored out of your mind, and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. and this movie fit that exact billing. sure, the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s....the writing as schmaltzy as the hallmark greeting card company's legendary poetry, and the one- dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked straight from central casting - but it was cute, and exactly what i needed last night. <br /><br />lauren holly and costas mandylor have great chemistry together - i liked it on "picket fences," and i'm happy to say they still have it over 10 year later. costas mandylor, at 41, is still possibly one of the handsomest men to grace the screens since ol' rudy valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago. rrrowrr! bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller skates on that show about the cartoon lady. i always thought he was something straight out of a hepburn-grant comedy. bravo!<br /><br />some people will probably say this was the corniest piece of cinema ever made, and i would probably have to agree - but come on! it's on the hallmark channel. what were you expecting? just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks, and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of zinfandel. trust me, you'll love and accept the schmaltz a whole lot more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming about costas mandylor swimming in a sea of tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with minty fresh chocolate icing. yummo! (ps. now i have a hankering for petit fours. thanks a lot, hallmark!)<br /><br />i really wish the evil girl had been cast with rachel ray, and maybe that dishy food nerd alton brown as the announcer instead of the creepy dude with the van dyk beard. shudder! <br /><br />that would have made my night. but hey, check out "just desserts."
