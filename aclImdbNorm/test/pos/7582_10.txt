i'm not a movie maker but i do know it is hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character. horses on mars does this and more. when you are watching a good movie you don't want it to end. this is how i felt watching this film. it is visually expansive and the microbe takes on such human qualities that you feel you are on the journey with him.<br /><br />really looking forward to see what exciting adventures mr. anderson takes us on in the future. well done.
