this movie pops up now and again on the abc in australia at about 3 am in the morning.<br /><br />it starts off with the scene of a bus crash in london.<br /><br />the films has got flashbacks of each character as the film progresses, plus the lapsed photography of big ben winding back, to symbolise what events occurred thirteen hours ago, up until the bus crash.<br /><br />it took me a while to understand it, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />if sean cunningham and quentin tarrantino got together and made a film, this may be the result - due to the flashbacks and small stories tying in, and deaths.<br /><br />i am unsure of the main characters, as it has been a while since i have seen it, but a rare gem indeed.
