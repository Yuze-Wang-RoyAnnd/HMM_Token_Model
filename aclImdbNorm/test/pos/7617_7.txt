very sadly, i can relate to this movie, as i'm 17, and have yet to be kissed, so i really feel for josie. it's been a while since seeing this film, but to write this review i re-watched it, and remembered everything i loved about it.<br /><br />drew barrymore is a great actress, and this role suited her really well at the time. the chemistry between sam and josie was really good, and michael vartan was an excellent actor in this.<br /><br />i loved the storyline too - as i said up there, i could relate, and it's rare you find a film you can completely relate to.<br /><br />all over - i loved it. 7/10
