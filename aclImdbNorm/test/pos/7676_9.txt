i have searched for this movie for years. i have great memories of the first-rate acting and singing in this movie. i never knew that the reason the movie was unobtainable was because of the actions of the gershwin family -- shame on them for trying to suppress at american classic!! i can only hope they will relent and allow this movie to be release and enjoyed by the american public.<br /><br />sammy davis, jr. is at his absolute best in this film. the only other performance of his this is it's equal was in 'anna lucasta'--another terrific film that i wish would be released on dvd.<br /><br />porgy & bess contained a first-rate, all-star cast. hopefully one day you'll get to see for yourself.
