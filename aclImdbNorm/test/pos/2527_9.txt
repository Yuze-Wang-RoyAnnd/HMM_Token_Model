this is probably the best movie from director hector babenco. it shows a brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the latin american countries, poverty and a survival instinct. the most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a "dog eat dog" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. very well acted and with a "no frills" approach, this movie will get to you, great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection. the starring role went to fernando ramos da silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed some years later during a robbery. i would suggest people to watch the movie "who killed pixote?" so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters. some other characters from the movie had a similar fate, some died and others are in jail. none the less this movie will last for a long time in your memory
