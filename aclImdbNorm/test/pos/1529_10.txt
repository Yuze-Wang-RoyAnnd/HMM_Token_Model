rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. what makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie. this is by far madeline stowe and alan rickman's performance of their careers. the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit. the only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. i have yet to see it other than on laserdisc. this truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on dvd. it really is that good.
