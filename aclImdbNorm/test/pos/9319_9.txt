yes, i give it a 10 because i compare it not only to others of it's kind but also to the dreck one is bombarded with on a daily basis in what's laughably called today's "popular culture." that aside, the film is beautifully cast, as has been stated elsewhere, and gives us a fairly good look at popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries. no small coincidence is that many of the plays that olcott played in involved a similar plot: boy meets girl, someone objects, (usually the father or some authority figure) boy struggles, boy wins girl. the was actually known at the time as a "chauncey olcott act." no coincidence, too, that john ford directed one. he called it, "the quiet man." and, "my wild irish rose," is, in itself, a "chauncey olcott act." great stuff, no? anyway, great songs, great stuff. enjoy.<br /><br />ps - after seeing the film i'd like to know more about bill scanlan. i found an obit that said he quit "mauvorneen," as a result of insanity (replaced, as in the film, by chauncey olcott) and died in an asylum several years later. but he had been, apparenlty, a very big star in his own right, who wrote songs and plays and had plays written for him.<br /><br />anyone know more?
