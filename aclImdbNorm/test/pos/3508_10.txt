i remember years ago bbc1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. i tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. the film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. it's one of my favorite slasher films and i have no idea where an uncut version can be found. currently deleted everywhere (except the usa where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). it's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen. wrong turn (the recent stan winston produced movie) owes a great deal to just before dawn. one of the better 80's slasher films and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
