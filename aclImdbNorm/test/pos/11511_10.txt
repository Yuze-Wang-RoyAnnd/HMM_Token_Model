first at all: if you like watching movies i recommend you not to watch this one. why? afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore...<br /><br />actually i don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of einar gudmundsson is. when in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing, like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography
