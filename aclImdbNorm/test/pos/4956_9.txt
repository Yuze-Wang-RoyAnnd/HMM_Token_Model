ok, yes its bad, yes its complete fluff, yes it makes dobbin the mule look like an oscar winner but look at it like i did i was 13, special effects were pretty much non exsistant in 90% of films, back in the good ole days when films needed a story line.. ok so even the storyline is a bit dodgy.. but wow did i get into this film as a kid in the 80s. cheesy rock, bad special effects, but airplanes an aerial fights and it had queens one vision on the soundtrack.. see even the worst things have a silver lining.. all in all if you want a bad film to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects (if there is such a film) this is the ideal choice
