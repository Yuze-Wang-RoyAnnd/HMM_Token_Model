the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in. people come looking for a b-grade horror film, or a "so bad it's good" movie. jack frost 2 is neither of these.<br /><br />it is, to put it simply, a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one. to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy (easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless "scary movies" combined) is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level. it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions.<br /><br />the premise is simple; the characters from the first movie, haunted by memories of jack frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. a new, improved jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of hydro-man from spider-man; essentially, he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly, divide himself, multiply himself, and, worst of all, he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness...antifreeze.<br /><br />what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost (a simply horrible movie) can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action, jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre.<br /><br />most of the entertainment comes the live action actors, who serve admirably. particularly funny among them are ray tooney (playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s), christopher allport (offering an insane, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and david allen brooks (taking the once serious role of manners to new, totally bizarre heights).<br /><br />the lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me.<br /><br />as a horror movie, jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman, rates a zero. but you have to understand, it's not a horror movie.
