jon cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men, which he perfected in this series. he longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny. then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating. in one of the funniest lines on tv ever -- i think in the final episode -- he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl. <br /><br />his partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting: "what's the worst that can happen? she says no."<br /><br />armed with newfound optimism, he proposes to his date over dinner. to which she replies, <br /><br />"god, no!"<br /><br />i laughed so hard i cried.
