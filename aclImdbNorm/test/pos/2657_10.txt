this movie is not just good, its amazing. besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. this is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. i am only 16 years old, and therefore i was raised into a world of modern effects and 3d animations in the movies. but nonetheless i was really, and i mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. the visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true kubrick style amazing and enchanting. it feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). the effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though i had seen the rating before i bought it. but this movie has more to it than this. the meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though i think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true kubrick style). how humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. how we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. on the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. but before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. this is to illustrate the beauty of it. beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. this is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. all of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 let me know if you agree with me.
