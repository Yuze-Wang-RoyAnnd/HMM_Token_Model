larisa shepitko's the ascent (1976) is an extraordinary, gruelling account of the partisans' fight against the nazis in german-occupied belorussia, the ascent reflects the russian obsession with the horrors of the great patriotic war, but unusually is both steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great russian collaborator. the true battle is not with the nazis, who hover in the background as mere extras, but between the russian nazi investigator and sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death unbeaten. with its many references to the crucifixion, the story takes on heroic proportions glorifying the sufferings of the martyr and his influence on future generations. a remarkable piece of work.
