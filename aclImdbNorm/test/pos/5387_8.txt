what is your freaking problem? do you have nothing better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about about how you find something in bad taste? here's an idea:go outside. that's right: walk outside your mom's basement that you've been living in for 13 years and go outside. "but i can't leave! star trek is on in 30 minutes and i still haven't married that avatar on world of warcraft!" oh my god, in that case, stay inside! alright, i might have gone overboard there. i mean, star trek is okay but i don't really watch it that much anymore. either way, do you really have to write crap about mind of mencia. it's a good show. maybe you're just venting your anger because that girl dumped you on world of warcraft. or you're constipated. try putting fiber in your diet.
