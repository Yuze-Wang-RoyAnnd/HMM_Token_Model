i think that toy soldiers is an excellent movie. it's one of the only movies that, aside from some well known actors, has an unknown cast that can actually act. in my opinion, the plot is captivating. it keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldn't possibly happen in real life. i think that everyone would enjoy this movie. sean astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent. he's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both. i hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting. if you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a sean astin fan you will definitely like this movie.
