ruthless evil warlord samanosuke (superbly played to the hateful hilt by yutaro gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village. the giant stone statue majin eventually comes to life to destroy samanosuke and his wicked minions. director kimiyoshi yasudo and screenwriter tetsuro yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age-old legendary folktale: there's a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place (it's specifically set in feudal japan), the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable, the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto, the special effects are fine and impressive, the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute, and majin's last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively, exciting, and more than a little scary. moreover, the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark, harsh and gritty world. this film earns bonus points for depicting majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. veteran composer akira ifukube supplies a typically rich, robust and rousing score. fujio morita's sharp, moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye. the capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances, with especially praiseworthy work by jun fujimaki as the valiant, protective kogenta and tatsuo endo as mean henchman gunjuro. highly recommended.
