this is sweet. the actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark. another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of roy munsin in king pin. this is most glorious story ever to be told. it should sell more copies than the bible. my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. the lady who gave the go ahead (friend of the family) was let go by the theater. i was 3 years old. i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd. it's beautiful.
