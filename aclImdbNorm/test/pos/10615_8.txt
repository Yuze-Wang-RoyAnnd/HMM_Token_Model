***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** it's easy to see why the script for this film won an oscar. at least during the first half. my head was spinning from all of the snappy lines whizzing by. noel coward plays a new york publisher (`why don't you publish books that you like?' - `what? and corrupt the public?') who charms and manipulates his many hangers-on. then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre flying dutchman take-off in which coward must find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace. very enjoyable until it gets bizarre. viewed at cinefest in syracuse in march 2003.
