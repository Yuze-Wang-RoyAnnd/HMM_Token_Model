henry thomas, and robin tunny, are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business. it's beyond me as to why they haven't received more recognition than they have. this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities are.<br /><br />acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality, and if these characters ain't odd, i'm at a loss to find anyone who is.<br /><br />the story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complicated, and tragic. i hated the ending, but if i hadn't, i wouldn't have loved the story as a whole. so there ya go.
