after reading about this documentary, i rented it and watched it with my teenage children. it was amazingly well-balanced, showing each side's perspective and leaving many questions unanswered. this is as it should be. i don't watch a documentary to be told what to think. i watch it to learn and to draw my own conclusions.<br /><br />afterward, we took a trip to waco and visited the branch davidians at the site of the conflagration. this was a potent lesson in seeing for yourself. and it drove home the basic underlying honesty behind "waco: the rules of engagement." if you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.
