for those with access to the bbc or the cbc, this has proved to be spectacular. like battlestar gallactica, this is a show rebuilt from the ground up. but in the case of dr who, they saved the best parts. i can't believe i am saying this but.. this is by far the best dr who. this has none of the cheap production values and sometimes slow plodding of the old show. the acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. the new doctor is easily the equal of the great tom baker, and the writer (former qaf lead) seems to have made even the minor characters come alive.<br /><br />i know...i'm gushing..but this should be on everyone sci-fi geeks list. i just don't know why it hasn't made its way here.. whatever you do...if you ever loved dr who or sci-fi..see this!!!
