i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie. but i was surprised to find it entertaining, interesting, and funny. it's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film. there were moments that made my hairs stand up! even better, though, were the highly amusing, occasionally hysterical, comedic moments in the film (you'll know which ones i'm talking about). there also are a few great special effects (and the humor and the special effects aren't necessarily separate).<br /><br />the acting, on the whole, is very good--way better than a typical low budget horror film. the lead (jackie), in particular, and many of the smaller, supporting roles (like the lawyer, the couple living next door, the pizza man) are well acted. if they hadn't been, the film wouldn't have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story. this is a good, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental!
