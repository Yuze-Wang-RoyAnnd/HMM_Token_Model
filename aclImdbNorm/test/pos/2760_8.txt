graphically, it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for fun.<br /><br />the ps1 version still has an issue with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks. the dreamcast version, which is rarely seen anymore, was the best version of the 4 versions (xbox eventually came out with a 5th with 2x), it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed the ps1 and n64 could handle.<br /><br />the levels are really amazingly done, from start to finish, like the first one, the school was my favorite, i enjoyed that level so much, not only for the golf cart that would sometimes run you over but for the length. that's what i liked about the first two games, they don't make these games graphically enhanced, they just focused on length of levels, which is cool.<br /><br />overall, just as good as the first one, and well worth playing.
