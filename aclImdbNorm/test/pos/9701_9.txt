i've been a huge fan of the cky videos, jackass, and viva la bam for a long time. they've had a great run and i expected my laughter to end, eventually. but, it hasn't yet. this movie kept my mouth open the entire time. i'm still laughing, randomly. i went to the theater with low expectations, thinking it wasn't going to be better than the first. oh, how incredibly wrong i was.<br /><br />there were many great moments in the movie. if you're squeamish, don't like randomly placed raw humor, or if you disliked the first movie, you probably won't like this. but, with that said, i almost wet my pants from laughing so hard. it had all kinds of different pranks, masochistic humor, toilet humor, puking, laughing, some great falls and massive damage done to all of the cast. ryan dunn even branded bam's rear end with an image that will be stuck there for a long time. i'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is.<br /><br />no pain, no gain? right? this movie has already done well, causing theaters all over america to laugh so hard, they'll be wishing it could last longer. i know i did. this movie did not feel short, at all, especially with the credits continuing the footage. but, i still wish it could've gone on forever. now, let's just wait and see when they release jackass number 3! overall, an excellent film, if you can get past the male nudity and a few sickening images. keep your kids out of this film. they don't need to see this, at least until they are older. support the crew and buy this when it comes out on dvd! i know i will.
