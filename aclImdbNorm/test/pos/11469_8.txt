this movie had a lot of ups & downs...the storyline is strong, while telling the saga of ma' barker growing up, & then her misadventures with her boys and the fbi..theresa russell is very talented and her beauty even shines through, as ma' barker, in public enemies. the direction of mark l. lester, while not as good as in "85's commando was still very interesting.<br /><br />eric roberts, plays a short-lived part as a security guard, turned thug(and ma's lover), and alyssa milano plays a prostitute, who hangs with the gang. frank stallone, plays a thug who helps out the gang, & while one of his exploits, gets one of ma's boy into trouble, he gets himself out, in a final way, so to speak...<br /><br />i was perplexed, intrigued & captivated, throughout this movie..so it makes me wonder what movie all these others who voted it so low watched!..for all those wondering..umm the fbi was actually that bad in the beginning, didn't have tommy guns like the outlaws had, & were thus at quite a disadvantage, whenever they did get into shootout's with gang's of that era..since everything i saw represented the 30's, i felt it was more realistic than many other movies made portraying that era...it is in may ways like a train wreck happening..you don't want to watch, but just have too..enjoy!!!
