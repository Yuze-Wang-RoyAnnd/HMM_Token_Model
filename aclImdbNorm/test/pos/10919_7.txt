in & out was a funny comedy with good performances by joan cusack, tom selleck, matt dillon, and kevin kline. the thought of kevin kline being gay was very funny. if i was him, i would hate to say i'm gay at his own wedding with his family, friends, and his going to be wife there. very seldom would that ever happen. i also loved when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio was talking to him. i'd say that in & out was a silly comedy with a lot of laughs and giggles. this is a recommended comedy and kevin kline had a great performance as a gay guy. trust me you'll like this movie.<br /><br />7/10
