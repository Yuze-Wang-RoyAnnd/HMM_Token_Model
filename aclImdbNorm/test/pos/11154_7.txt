like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down, so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity. donna reed is a case in point.<br /><br />i don't think donna reed ever thought that donna stone was anything challenging, not to a woman who had won an oscar for playing a very different type in from here to eternity. she was certainly better prepared to play wife, mother, and homemaker donna stone after having played mary bailey in it's a wonderful life. <br /><br />donna was always beautiful and wise and ever helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband. carl betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. talk about the man being ever ready in a crisis.<br /><br />though this was the donna reed show because donna's husband at the time, tony owen produced it. yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children, shelley fabares and paul petersen. fabares had that best selling teen record johnny angel which she introduced on the show. she successfully made the transition to adult star, most known for her role in coach as craig t. nelson's wife.<br /><br />but petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day. the donna reed show dare i say got most of its viewers because of him. it's forgotten now, but petersen also had a best selling record, my dad. didn't do half as well as johnny angel. <br /><br />now paul petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself. so many of them end so tragically, it's good work that he's doing. <br /><br />the stone family was the quintessence of middle america. they lived in a suburb near chicago, they led wholesome lives. mom and dad were always there for the kids. of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew. <br /><br />it's this series i believe was the model for the tv town of pleasantville where tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are sucked into. <br /><br />i have pleasant memories of the donna reed show. easy to take, but not too seriously.
