has the drama, suspense, and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains as well as educates.<br /><br />the writers know their material and it shows. the direction is always engaging and not blase, and the acting terrific. why this show didn't win any awards tells me the "powers that be" in hollyweird don't know drama or much else for that matter. <br /><br />there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out. i'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull. rent this series at once! let's hope its brought back from celluloid extinction.
