"japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own", while that may be true, it applies to all except for one thing, that being,.....major league baseball....but not to worry, "mr baseball" is there to try and change all that. but just who will change whom, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! tom selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines-on in his comedic roles. the storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on. the japanese people are a gentle, respectful people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society. all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable, funny film. it's definitely worth the watch!
