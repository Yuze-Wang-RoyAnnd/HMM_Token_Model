this film was filled with great acting, great musical sounds that blow your mind completely away. larenz tate,(darius lovehall),"waist deep",'06 was a sharp cat with the gals and he soon met his waterloo with nia long,(nina mosley),"big momma's house",2000. nina put her heart and soul into this role and when she meets up with darius, the sparks fly at first and then there is a sort of hate relationship. the entire cast of actors made this a very entertaining film, with plenty of comedy, drama and lots of loving and cheating going on. this is a very down to earth film and at the same time shows how everyone eventually has his and her destiny in life and are placed in their little corner of this big world. great film, enjoy !
