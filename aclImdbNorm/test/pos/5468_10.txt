i have not seen it since 1998 and yet i still can't get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it so that shows what an impression it made.<br /><br />just a wonderful story.<br /><br />i just hope to see the stair at least once in person...<br /><br />i didn't know much about mr. petersen before this movie as i hadn't seen any of his previous works but his subtle acting in this impressed me and i think his portrayal of grissom on csi just shows more of the same. he knows enough to let the character shine through instead of the actor shining through which makes him just that much better of an actor.<br /><br />i can't remember enough about the "poor accents" to comment but i must say i have always enjoyed barbara hershey in all of her roles as well and i thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie.
