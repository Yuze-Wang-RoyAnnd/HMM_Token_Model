crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone at the bowlo has seen it and all say the same. the wheel of cheese was a great part of the movie, also the loud speaker "dear mr so and so you have left you right indicator on". or when jack goes home and lays down on the couch and cracks a beer, "bowls is hard work" cracked me up. and when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling bingo number. jack buying all the raffle tickets to win the meat tray. bloody great movie if you are into lawn bowls as you can relate to it, if your not a lawn bowler forget it i think. the evans head bowlo would rate as the best club in aus, friendly people, great company.hi to evans head bowlo steve
