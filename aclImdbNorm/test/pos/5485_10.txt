i am a huge fan of big, loud, trashy, completely stupid action movies such as the rock, con air etc. all of these are great fun to watch but, when you think about it, extremely silly. in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well. with plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think. the last shot of the movie is eastwood and russo sitting together on the steps of the white house watching the pigeons to gentle, peaceful music and i felt a deep feeling of satisfaction. this was because i cared about the characters and i was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion. it felt like a true story. as the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect jfk on that fateful day in dallas, clint eastwood is fantastic. he brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary. on the other side of the spectrum is john malkovich, as the creepy predator who tortures eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president. this oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin. throughout the movie, malkovich talks to eastwood as if they are friends. he doesn't threaten him, he doesn't lie to him, he doesn't laugh at him, but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment. as well as this thrilling main plot, there is a charming love story involving rene russo, another agent and eastwood. despite the age difference, they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely. to sum up, i love this film because it has a mind.
