this 1-hour 30-minute inside joke is best understood by catholics, the number one religion of self-medicating comedians the world over. that isn't to say it can't stand on its own which it does, that the film isn't without its flaws, which its got. technical issues, mostly: belief that in 1998 digital was the answer when in fact it was in its infancy - a beta of a beta if you will, and re-mastering will never improve it. for the love of god, hal...please get yourself a red one. or three.<br /><br />if you like hartley films of course, you'll like it. i liked it, because i liked grim/fool, and there were added benefits of retrospect: i couldn't help noticing a disturbing self-prophecy, an airliner soaring overhead, used as a harbinger of armageddon in this 1998 movie. it was as if cheney had gotten the whole idea from hal. it's true - hartley moves his players round into the camera like it's the house of commons, just one piece of the gimmickry that needs a rest. after all, we're already paying attention to the actors, and the writing is alive. not great writing, but...fervent. can i use the word fervent? purposeful, intelligent, not condescending.<br /><br />absolutely love pj harvey in this, course i'd love her anywhere. oddly, if helen mirren needs a younger self, she should look harvey up and bring a bottle of blond.
