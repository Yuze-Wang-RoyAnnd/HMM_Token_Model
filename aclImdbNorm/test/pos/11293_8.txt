don't watch this film while, or soon after, eating.<br /><br />having said that, begotten will stick with you for the rest of your life, like it or not. based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man spasming above ground (to paraphrase the title sequence/introduction), this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery you'll ever see in a film.<br /><br />there is no dialogue, only image after image describing the cycle of life. the film's combination of stark black and white photography compounded with some truly creepy background sounds work to drive home the maker's message.<br /><br />the movie begins with god (portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man) slicing open his torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth. after his death, mother nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate herself with his blood and semen and gives birth to man, represented by a maggot of a human convulsing on the earth.<br /><br />the landscape is a barren waste, populated by hulking shrouded humanoids who eventually happen upon mother nature and man. after a slew of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and destruction of man, these humanoids proceed to pound the remains of the corpses back into the ground, and the cycle of life begins anew.<br /><br />i actually rented this from blockbuster one night, based on the cover art and hype content, but this is definitely not a blockbuster-type film. don't expect narrative, dialogue or any pulled punches. this is intense imagery based on a dark subject.<br /><br />i give this movie some high marks for the filmwork and audio, but i don't think i'll be watching it too often, if again. i like my movies dark and unique, but this one is exponentially more than i expected.
