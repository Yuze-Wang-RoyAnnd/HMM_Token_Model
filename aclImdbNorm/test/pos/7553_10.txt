i first encountered arthur penn's "four friends" late one night on hbo. having never heard of it, i expected very little, but watched because i was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of penn and screenwriter steve tesich would be like. for the next two hours or so, i sat mesmerized, watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove. a semi-autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to america growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s, "four friends" follows the story of danilo, an eastern european immigrant (the brilliant craig wasson), from his arrival in the united states through a decade that changed the american landscape. accompanying danilo on his journey are his friends georgia (the radiant jodi thelan, in a role that sadly, she has never had the opportunity to equal), tom (jim metzler) and david (michael huddleston). "four friends" covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here, but if you haven't seen this film, i urge you to find a copy (it's just been released on dvd) and watch it. you won't be disappointed. tesich's script is wonderfully poignant
