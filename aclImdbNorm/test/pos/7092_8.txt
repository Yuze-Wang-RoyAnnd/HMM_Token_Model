kate gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses meryl streep(out of africa). she is wonderful is every part that she plays. the yale graduate is the pride and joy of the american cinema.<br /><br />kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, george, role well developed by brilliant actor and also oscar winner, william hurt (smoke, kiss of the spider woman) has a hard time with the deteriorating health of his one true thing, and seeks his daughter's help. the poor daughter, ellen gulden, ren'ee zellweger (jerry maguire) has way too much expected of her. no breaks! the story takes a very realistic view on the illness of a parent. in this movie the only daughter has to put her life on hold to care for the needs of others. there is always one in every family who faces that kind of responsibility. ellen is angry the beginning of the movie, but as time passes she ends up understanding her mothers' life time dedication to her family. she even asks her mom: how do you do his, every day, in and out and nobody notices it? that is what women do, a lot of what i call invisible work. moreover we clean, we fix, we mend, we stretch, we celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, the mistress, outreachers, disciplinarians, sensitive. some of us, like both women in this movie, have the perfect education, are the psychological pillar for the entire family and also do all that invisible work! that is kate ellen, and many women in our society. many of us have already gone through that stage of life when our parents age and died. i have been there. they just went too young. i have given my parents my thanks, but i never understood them as well as when i had to play their roles, and had to walk in their shoes. this movie mirrors the reality of life. perhaps it is sad, but that is how life is, at times. george a professor at harvard is complicated person, who appears to think that his work is more important than everybody else, and has a very "master/servant" mentality toward the women in his life. he is not strong enough to cope. if you want to see good acting and the reality of life do not miss this movie. favorite scenes: the restaurant coming to kate, violins and all. the making of a table out of broken china. that i so symbolic! we are all broken vessels! favorite quotes: george: "it is only by going uphill, that you realize that you are really going downhill." george "you have a harvard education but where is your heart?" <br /><br />
