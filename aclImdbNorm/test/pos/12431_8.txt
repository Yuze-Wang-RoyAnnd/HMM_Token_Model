a beautiful woman, a backwoods, inbred monster man, a super sweet monster truck, a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends...one anal retentive, overly sensitive nerd and the other a foul mouthed, adolescent slob. throw them all together with a dash of jeepers creepers, texas chainsaw massacre and road trip and you've got monster man. a hilarious horror/comedy outing that never sets out to "say something". it's a simple, straight forward laugh fest. unpretentious and well made, this horror/comedy is at its heart, a buddy flick. this film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces. i highly recommend this to fright fans looking to be entertained.
