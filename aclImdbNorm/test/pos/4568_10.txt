i love this movie....one of my all-time favorites!!! this was the first big screen movie my mom took me to see when i was 9. i highly recommend it to every african-american. this story is about love, trust, challenges, and everyday life of a black family. all the actors worked well together. i wish it was on video, but as of yet, it is not available that i know of. i caught it on television a few years ago, and recorded it, so whenever i get the urge to watch it...i have it! the soundtrack is awesome too! a must-see!
