this was charlie chaplin's first all-talking film. yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, modern times, but it was still essentially a silent film. so, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear chaplin speak on film.<br /><br />the movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. while i enjoyed the film, i was not nearly as impressed by this as chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. that's because i really felt annoyed by some of chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played adenoid hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. the silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the three stooges). plus, playing a funny hitler is hard for me to take.<br /><br />however, when chaplin played the jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. this film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. the final speech by the barber (impersonating hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. watch the film for this reason alone.
