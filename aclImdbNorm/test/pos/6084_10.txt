i won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. that's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it i believe...or you simply hate it. i don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. however, i feel very passionately about the english patient, as well as millions of other people do. <br /><br />the awards say it all. <br /><br />i don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, i couldn't agree more.<br /><br />9-oscars. <br /><br />41-wins.<br /><br />37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. <br /><br />from the director, anthony minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as mr. peterman (from t.v.s seinfeld) said, "elaine, i simply can't take my eyes off of it!" in this instance, i don't agree with elaine's response. but the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. the cinematography,(john seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. i have not really paid much attention to juliette binoche, until now. well, not entirely true i loved her performance in "sabrina" lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to harrison ford. but this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, i'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. ralph fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying count laszlo de almasy. i had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! what can you say except, see this picture again.
