i was lucky enough to see a test screening of 'el padrino' a couple months ago in santa monica. i was blown away. you don't see films like this anymore. in the vein of scosese, chapa deftly tells the tragic story of kilo as he maneuvers the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of escobarian proportions. the characters are complex and conflicted. the emotions are real. the action is fast and furious. the stunts are expansive. and tilly is hot. she hasn't looked this good since her 'bound' days. i'd recommend this to anyone. it's a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s. and to all the naysayers out there
