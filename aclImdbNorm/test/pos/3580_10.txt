an stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.<br /><br />the good:<br /><br />the camera work was absolutely phenomenal. every shot is done beautifully.<br /><br />it was interesting seeing all the different animals that i could have never even imagined.<br /><br />david attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. no one could have done any better.<br /><br />the bad:<br /><br />there were one or two different times where there was a reference to the earth being 1 million years old ( i hold a different belief). <br /><br />overall a tv series anyone can enjoy. i highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.
