king of queens is comic genius. kevin james, whom plays ips deliveryman doug heffernan is extremely funny, leah remini who plays doug's wife carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. the true magic of the show however is the scenes with jerry stiller, they are the funniest in the show. jerry, a comic genius, plays carrie's father, arthur spooner, whom lives in doug and carrie's always cold basement. i must admit that i never watched this show until this year, 2006. whenever i had flipped by it previously it never seemed funny, but with the cancellation of friends, still standing, and yes dear, i needed some new comedy. actually giving the king of queens a chance i discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. so funny in fact that i downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8 hour blocks. i strongly urge anyone whom has not seen this treasure to check it out. you will not be disappointed.
