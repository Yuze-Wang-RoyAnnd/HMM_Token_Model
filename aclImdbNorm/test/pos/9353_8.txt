my top 2 actors happen to be in this film - robert ryan and robert mitchum. <br /><br />ryan could play anything from shakespeare to arthur miller and play it magnificently. in this film when he starts his speech "...people with names like samuels and others with names that are hard to say" - it is chilling to watch him.<br /><br />robert young plays the policeman who is called to investigate the murder of samuels (sam levine), a civilian, who is chatting with several soldiers in a bar. mitchell is the soldier wanted in connection with it - his wallet has been found in the apartment. but mitchell is a gentle soldier, who is only missing his wife.<br /><br />the story is told from different perspectives. mitchell and samuels strike up a friendship and go back to samuels apartment. samuels seems to know the loneliness that mitchell is feeling. "for years you have been concentrating on one peanut and now it is gone you don't know what to feel" he says about the war.<br /><br />ryan is superb as monty, the psychotic racist.<br /><br />robert young (along with dick powell) was an actor whose career was re-juvenated by film-noir. "crossfire", "they won't believe me" and "the other woman" are great examples.<br /><br />robert mitchum is his usual laid back self as the philosopical keeley.<br /><br />gloria graham and paul kelly as the "odd couple" are outstanding as well in their brief but telling roles.<br /><br />this is probably the best film about racism ever made.
