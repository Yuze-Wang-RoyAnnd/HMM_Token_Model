okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through, but how well was the emotional stuff handled? it would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. the image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. that's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically, the previous being the last dalek from series one, but by jove it's worked. add to that the other ex-female who had been "upgraded" on the eve of her wedding, and jackie tyler recognising her husband after she had become "cyber" and you have a permanent throat lump. keep it up!
