bit of a curate's egg, this one. i started off hating it, with it's predictable' old dark house' set-up, it's constant references to recent us horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridors.<br /><br />but it does get going and has it's moments of originality.<br /><br />i began to wonder , once the killing started, how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective.<br /><br />naschy is fine and by the end it's been an enjoyable enough movie. it just does not jump up and grab one, hard enough.
