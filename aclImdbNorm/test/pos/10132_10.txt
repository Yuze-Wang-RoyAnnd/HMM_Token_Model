ed harris and cuba gooding jr. where cast perfectly in this film. it's a heart-warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care. i think there was a lot of realism with the characters. the screenwriter didn't incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do, which i thought created a more realistic story line.<br /><br />writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard. <br /><br />there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously. ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach, realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio.
