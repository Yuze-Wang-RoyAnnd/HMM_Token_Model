i've seen just about all of the coen brothers' films now, and i have to say this is one of their better films. i wouldn't dare say it's better than "the big lebowski", but it was very good in it's own right.<br /><br />i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times. i loved all the characters, especially tim blake nelson (delmar) and john turturro's (pete).<br /><br />there really isn't anything bad i can say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone. it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers' films, then you'll hopefully like this one too. and if you liked what you saw in the trailer, i think you'll like the film, but don't hold me to it.<br /><br />anyhow, i hope that you like(d) the film as much as i do. thanks for reading,<br /><br />-chris
