i am a big fan of larkin's works, i believe that he was amid the greatest 20th century poets. the film itself does a great justice to the bard of hull. wonderfully portrayed by all the players in their roles. bonneville does do a service to the sexually repressed larkin, he avoids an impression and strays from becoming a caricature. the use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself. rather than acting out the massive intensity with which larkin felt, the use of his words themselves give a better insight into plot and add a much more sombre but altogether more fascinating atmosphere. most enjoyable.
