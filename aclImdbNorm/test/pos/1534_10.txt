even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time i saw this movie. not for people who are easily upset by intense material! the finest performances by alan rickman and madelaine stowe, without a doubt. this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for any reason, whether they are anarchist's or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone. i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame. it still scares the hell out me today. it's happening now.<br /><br />apparently, imdb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review. imdb might want to get a grip! some of us are a little more succinct about writing opinions.
