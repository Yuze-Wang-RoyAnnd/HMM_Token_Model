robert deniro and eddie murphy, what a team. while rene russo, william shanter, and that guy from the everyday video are alongside for the ride. this is a funny and a great movie. not only is it that, but it's a good buddy flick.<br /><br />tom dey (shanghai noon) directs this hell of a movie. from start to finish, it was a masterpiece. no slapstick humor here. but good old time laughs. making fun of all other cop flicks (to name a few lethal weapon, beverly hills cop, fifteen minutes, and etc...)<br /><br />if you want to see a movie, see this one. you'll love it. it has a wonderful cast and crew. so, get off your a** from watching "cops" and watch "showtime" for a cop film. and remember, they'll be protrolling your neighbor at um...um...oh! at friday nights at 8:00 (man, everyone says i'm a bad writer).
