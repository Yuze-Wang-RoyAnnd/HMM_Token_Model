this is the first movie i've seen from singapore and it's great. if you don't know a lot about asia, its languages and its culture, then this film may be a bit confusing for the non-informed people. as an asian-american who's double majoring in two asian languages (one of them being mandarin) and has taken some asian american studies classes, this film was easier for me to understand, but even without that kind of knowledge, i believe this movie is still accessible to its foreign audiences as long as you keep in mind that it's a coming-of-age type of movie. the film is definitely worth seeing just so that you get the chance to see what kind of issues singapore's young teenage boys are struggling and having to deal with. this is an awesome coming-of-age movie, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. the actors are outstanding.
