irrespective of the accuracy of facts, bandit queen is a true story, its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994. this movie is violent, powerful and thought provoking.the protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood, whose adversity brought out the best(or worst) out of her. keeping the subjectivity aside, there is no doubt that phoolan's character from a young girl of 8, who is married off by her father to clear a debt(pun intended), to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste, has evolved into a champion in her own right. her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre.<br /><br />i can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece, bandit queen needs to be 'studied' in the indian context, and not just checked out in stereotypes. i may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the indian audience, its a shame that the movie had a delayed, overtly censored release in india.<br /><br />bandit queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in india, being a woman and that too a lower caste, her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life, which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess. she responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be. call it divine justice or judiciary failure, had she killed a single person she would have been hanged, she killed 24 and got revered, respected and glorified.<br /><br />p.s # whoever found her character "psychotic", needs to be sodomized at 8, gangraped by 10 men at a go and paraded naked. then they should be asked- how normal do they feel?
