a really good australian film .beautifully recreates the look and feel of sydney as it was in the 1950s. this movie greatly impressed me when i first saw it during it's initial cinema release and it still stands up very well. fine directing job by phil noyce, wonderful camera work , thoughtful lighting and some fine performances across the board. an absolute "must see" for any students of 70's australian cinema.one out of the box !
