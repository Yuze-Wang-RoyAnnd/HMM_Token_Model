a competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of jack lemmon and walter matthau. i suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two grumpy old men films, as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy team-ups spotlighting the comical duo in their twilight years. the idea is a sure-fire one: matthau, a bumbling gambler who's thousands of dollars in debt, connives his unsuspecting friend lemmon into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies; the catch is, they've been signed on as dance hosts and matthau can't dance.<br /><br />out to sea is a funny film, and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of lemmon and matthau. i found brent spiner (best known as data from star trek: the next generation) to be very humorous as the snobby ball-busting dance coordinator. as the prissy boss of the two aging actors, he manages to match them in the laughs department. though the film doesn't really need any, there's also a a love story or two to be found here as well, involving dyan cannon (who looks pretty fine for her years).
