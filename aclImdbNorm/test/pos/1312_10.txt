this movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, mishima. it jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. it captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.<br /><br />i think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works. the sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective. they could be used as exemplars for any set designer. i woke up at night dreaming of the golden pagoda. <br /><br />the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art. after watching this film, i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or japanese history.
