i felt that way when i saw the episode in its original run and still agree when i watch it on reruns. you had the culprits totally mocking columbo throughout the episode and treating him like he has down syndrome. and in the end you see their shock when columbo gets them dead to rights and arrest them. you also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy killers. they stillcouldn't give columbo his props and say he just got lucky. i like the formula where there is an elaborate crime, the killer(s) totally underestimate columbo, and then you get their realization that columbo was totally playing the criminals. i recall in the first few episodes of the post 1989 episodes they weren't following that formula and this was the first episode that i was pleased with.
