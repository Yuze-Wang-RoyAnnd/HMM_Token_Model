by mistake, i ordered a series from the bbc, their new version of robin hood. very disappointing in comparison with ros. terrible costuming and backgrounds. while i enjoyed the sheriff, who took cues from the nick grace character, the rest of the cast left much to be desired. as a "for instance", marion's costuming looked suspiciously like it came from walmart. and sir guy, well, he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie! ros has stolen the spotlight, probably forever, in the telling of this tale. cast, costuming, story lines, scenery, filming and soundtrack by clannad are all superb, as is evidenced by all the continual feedback some 26 years on. ros is a timeless classic. my thanks to all who made the series.
