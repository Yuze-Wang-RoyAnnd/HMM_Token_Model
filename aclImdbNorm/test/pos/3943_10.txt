right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie i've seen in a very long time. granted i spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once i had accepted that i would never understand everything from the subtitles i was able to enjoy the film.<br /><br />can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? what does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? why does buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings? does any of this matter when faced with the sheer sumptuousness of the visuals and the sly humour of the characters. any battle for my heart was won once i saw the main protagonist dressed as spider-man - awesome! many people will complain about a lack of story cohesion but for a fun movie to laugh about with a bunch of mates you can't do better, especially if you do an alcoholic shot every time someone says "i will love you 10,000 years".
