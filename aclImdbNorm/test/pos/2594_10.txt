rabbit seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature bugs bunny/daffy duck/elmer fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. love bugs and daffy stirring up "pronoun trouble" with daffy always the victim of elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets elmer in his love struck mode. chuck jones and michael maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons i've laughed at since i was a kid. and at least two of them end with daffy's exclamation to bugs: "you're despicable!" can't get better that that!
