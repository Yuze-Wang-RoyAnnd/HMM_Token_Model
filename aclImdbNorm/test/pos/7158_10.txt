i saw forgiving the franklins at a paramount screening and loved it i have to be honest i really didn't want to go and i had become quite jaded about the movies being made today i have to tell you forgiving the franklins was fresh and wonderfully put together i laughed my ass off it was great story telling i could not believe two guys shot this and put the whole thing together. i thought if these guys can do a movie like this with this budget imagine what they could do with big money behind them. and then i thought be the jaded guy iam the studios would probably f...it up anyway. that being said thanks guys i got lost and in your film and that's why i go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours.
