after seeing this movie, i have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fueled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is ninja iii: the domination.<br /><br />we all know that sho kosugi rocks. that is a given, but how about jordan bennett's ultra macho interpretation of his character police officer "billy secord"? bravo mr. bennett, bravo. you prove early on, while trying to seduce the buxom christie (played to perfection by one miss lucinda dickey of breakin' fame)that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft. i particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym. oh you could have helped sure, but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss. secord will wear the pants in this relationship. i also enjoyed how mr. bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife-beater tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back. back and shoulder hair are hot and secord knows it. and how about lucinda dickey? all i can say is "kaboom" - i see a sex bomb getting ready to explode. she's got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whiz. the chemistry behind dickey and bennett is what makes this movie tick. you'd think she would hate him because he's kind of a cheesy jerk, but no my friends. the animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bond like crazy glue. sho kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, though still a main character, which is fine by me because all i wanted was more bennett and dickey. he does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see. the special effects? wow. that is all i can say. i will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint. i love ninja iii: the domination, and can only hope that there is a ninja 4. i give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars. disappoint.
