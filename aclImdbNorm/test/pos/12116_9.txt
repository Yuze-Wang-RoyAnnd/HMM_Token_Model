this was a great anime. true the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than ninja scroll, the problem that it was kinda long.<br /><br />japanese movie star hiroyuki sanada who played ujio from last samurai played the main character jiro and it was directed by rintaro who did galaxy express 999 and metropolis.<br /><br />the anime has some good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain tenkai and ando shouzan and of course lets not forget the beautiful musical scores in the film.<br /><br />all in all this movie is worth watching for fans of anime, animation in general, action, and samurai/ninja flicks. despite the lows in the film that didn't the film from being a great film to watch.<br /><br />don't miss this film.
