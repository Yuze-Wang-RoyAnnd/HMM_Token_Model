one of the greatest crimes made against sci-fi television was the cancellation of farscape. one of the most well-written, well-acted and over-all best shows ever to grace the airwaves, it set new standards for sci-fi television. once the flagship, highest rated, critically acclaied show of the sci-fi channel, it defies explaination as to why shows like buffy, tremors: the series, and even stargate: sg-1 have lasted as long as they have. yes, even buffy. but i'll save my buffy bashing for another time. farscape was poorly treated by the sci-fi channel, continually tossed around in scheduling, reruns rarely shown and never really advertised. but while the show has been cancelled, all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back (even henson company ceo brian henson). there is also an extensive fan-based movement to bring the show back . overall things are looking far from dark, and hopefully, fans will get their season 5.
