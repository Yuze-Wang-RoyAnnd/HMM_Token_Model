when i first rented batman returns, i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. i mean, jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? simple, throw in danny devito.<br /><br />batman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman. there are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. however, the music is similar to the first if not darker. the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. this movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first batman.<br /><br />now for the performances. michael keaton thankfully returns as batman/bruce wayne. he was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman, need more! danny devito gave an award-winning performance as the penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. and it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwoman/selina kyle. two completely different personalities in one. she actually got a good amount of back story as well. christopher walken didn't disappoint as max shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish ceo of the power company. michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred, and he was just as good here as well. pat hingle also returns as gordon, although i feel he was really never in the spotlight.<br /><br />with lots of great twists and sub-plots, batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original.<br /><br />9/10
