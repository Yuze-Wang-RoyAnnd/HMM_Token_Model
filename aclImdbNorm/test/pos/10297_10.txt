this is a fabulous film.<br /><br /> the plot is a good yarn, and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. what was deliberate, and what was coincidence? who is in love with who?<br /><br /> you get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth.<br /><br /> with a bit of effort following the twists and turns, you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people.<br /><br /> take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen.<br /><br /> more than keeping you guessing, the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds - i defy anyone to predict!<br /><br /> but more likely you will need more than one viewing - i saw this at the pictures on its original release three times, and it got better each time.<br /><br /> the acting was very good, with a standout performance by romane bohringer as alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble.<br /><br /> a classic. the second-best film of the 1990s.
