it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to resurrect doctor who and make it " bigger and better " but i'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - rumours . but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march 2004 channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - christopher eccleston . yes that christopher eccleston an actor i've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in let him have it and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true . as the months passed more and more information was leaked , billie piper was being cast , the daleks would be returning and the mill , the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were contracted to do the special effects for the show . for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series , massive billboards in london informed the public about the return of the show , tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and christopher eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as blue peter , mastermind ( which had a special doctor who night edition ) , this morning and friday night with johnathan ross . in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television , it had better be bloody good <br /><br />so was it bloody good ? undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv charts . to give you clue of its rating success only one episode ( the ark in space episode two - febuary 1975 ) from the old series had made it into the top five tv chart . the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there's far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice . let's laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time , celebrity wrestling and mauled ant and dec's saturday night takeaway . of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role . for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you'll see in a spielberg / hollywood movie . there's a dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands , exotic aliens , a 19th century cardiff that looks like a 19th century cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen . i promise you'll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series , joe ahearne especially will one day be in the hollywood a list <br /><br />there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies . it may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not ( in my opinion they're not ) but what's not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by rtd . as i mentioned in my review of casanova he cheats the audience and he does the same thing here: when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him the doctor bellows " attack plan delta " which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot , a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser he's been hiding and rtd scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings . in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the " bad wolf " is which seems to have got rtd out of a tight spot more than the doctor . and of the endings i'm trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor ? more often than it's a supporting character or the doctor's companion who saves the day . the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series ? one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way he's written as a grinning loon . eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he's absolutely breath taking at scenes when he's showing grief , like the tear running down his face in the end of the world but more often than not he's written as a " tom baker on speed " character . it's obvious why eccleston hasn't done much comedy in his career - he's not very good at it <br /><br />am i starting to sound like i hate this show ? sorry i didn't mean to but it's just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed some others haven't and they're nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who . let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s , imagine a story like the sea devils with a massive budget directed by joe ahearne ! oh and one last request - can we see these " next time " trailers scrapped ? they reveal all the best bits of next week's episode
