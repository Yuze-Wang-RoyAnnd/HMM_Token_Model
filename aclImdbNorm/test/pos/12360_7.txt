victor sjostrom, who is the grandfather of swedish cinema, directed this stark, existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption, and the bleakest moments of the human condition. he stars as david holm, a no good-nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage: death.<br /><br />unlike many silent films during the period, the film is nearly absent scenes with over-acting. the pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar dickensian narrative. however, examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time, it's a very daring and unique film. audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic, and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. it's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure.<br /><br />watching the film, it's easy to see the later influences this film had on swedish master ingmar bergman. most of the great bergman themes are here on full display. sjostrom, of course, later starred in bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: wild strawberries. this would be sjostrom's final performance as an actor. sjostrom based the script on a novel by swedish writer selma lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
