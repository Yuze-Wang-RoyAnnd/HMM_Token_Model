topless touch football!! a wet t-shirt contest!! a jockstrap raid!! this "sheanimal house" has it all. except a plot and good actors. the film consists of several pranks and catfights between the h.o.t.s. girls and the bitchy pi house. the dialouge is a scream and the soundtrack is sublimely brilliant. over the past couple of months it's been popping up all over cable, so do yourself a favor and watch out for it. h.o.t.s. is so bad it's good!
