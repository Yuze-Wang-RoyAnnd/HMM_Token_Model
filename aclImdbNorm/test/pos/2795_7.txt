**spoilers ahead**<br /><br />it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be<br /><br />such a disappointment. i thought this was full of (silly) clich'es and<br /><br />that it basically tried to hard. <br /><br />to the (american) guys out there: how many of you spend your<br /><br />time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey<br /><br />sounds? to the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenly<br /><br />gone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with your<br /><br />husband? to the french: would you really ask about someone<br /><br />being "`a la fac" when you know they don't speak french? wouldn't<br /><br />you use a more common word like "universit'e"? <br /><br />i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand<br /><br />europe (and i love it), but my (german) roommate and i found this<br /><br />pretty insulting overall. it looked like a movie funded by the<br /><br />european parliament, and it tried too hard basically. it had all<br /><br />sorts of differences that it tried to tie together (not a bad thing in<br /><br />itself) but the result is at best awkward, but in fact ridiculous--too<br /><br />many clashes that wouldn't really happen. then the end of the<br /><br />movie--the last 10 minutes--ruined all the rest. why doesn't xavier<br /><br />talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris? why does<br /><br />he just walk off? why does he just run away from his job, is that<br /><br />"freedom"? and in the end, is the new europe supposed to rest on<br /><br />a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day? is this what<br /><br />it's made up of? <br /><br />besides, the acting was pretty horrible. i can't believe judith<br /><br />godr`eche's role and acting. why was she made to look like<br /><br />emanuelle b'eart so much? at first i thought xavier was ok but<br /><br />with retrospect i think he was pretty bad. <br /><br />and that's all really too bad, because technically (opening credits,<br /><br />scenes when he's asking what papers he needs) it was really<br /><br />good (except for sound editing around the british siblings), and the<br /><br />soundtrack was great too. so the form was good, but the content<br /><br />pretty horrible.
