"confirmed dead" is an important episode in the series, as it introduces four new characters: the rescue team that naomi contacted before getting a knife in her back by locke. however, as the quote in my one-line summary says, their true purpose for being on the island may be something else entirely. all the new characters appear intriguing (especially miles, some sort of psychic / exorcist), but at this point it's still too early to make solid judgments. i felt that this episode was a slight step down from "the beginning of the end" (no flash-forwards this time; short-term flashbacks instead), but it still has its stunning moments and picks up steam near the end. *** out of 4.
