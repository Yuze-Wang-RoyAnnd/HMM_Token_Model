i had no expectations when i started to watch this movie. how surprised i was! this is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! it's not simple. if you only enjoy police academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. the cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like cube, silence of the lambs and the lawnmower man, along with lots of completely new ideas. wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films i have seen in a long time! be open-minded, and you will love it!
