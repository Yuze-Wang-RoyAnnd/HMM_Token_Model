loved this movie!! great acting by carla gugino. interesting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong (don't they all?). some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot was easy to follow without being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible. it was a totally unexpected delight. more "quentin-ish" than most films try to be.
