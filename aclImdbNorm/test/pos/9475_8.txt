this is the first james cagney film i have ever really watched. i was never interested in his movies before because i figured i wouldn't like anything in that style of cinema and because i've heard most cagney films are the same. i have to say i really liked it. by today's standards for movies, it was not special, but i found it surprisingly entertaining. cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well.
