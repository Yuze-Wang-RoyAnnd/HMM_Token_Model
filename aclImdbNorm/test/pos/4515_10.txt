the kite runner was beautiful, poignant and very moving. i particularly loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor portraying the father. it really made me want to go back and read the book again.<br /><br />the music was a wonderful part of the fabric of the movie. if there is a soundtrack coming out for the film, i will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. it is also a visually stunning film. the cinematography was gorgeous and really added to experience.<br /><br />the brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive of how i felt at the end of the film..."it is a deep feeling of longing for someone or someplace, which is very sweet but also tinged with an inescapable sadness" (definition provided years ago by antonio carlos jobim).<br /><br />saw it at a small cinema here for an advance screening. i would love to see it again on a really large screen with a tricked out sound system.<br /><br />can't wait for the formal release. i will definitely recommend the film to friends.
