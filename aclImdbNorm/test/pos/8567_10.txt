h.o.t.s. is proof that at one time, the movie industry said "f-off" to the censors, and made movies with whatever they wanted! in today's world, this movie would be too "over the top" and "extreme" for it to be anywhere than behind a velvet curtain. although, bestbuy had several copies on their $5.99 rack (in case anyone wanted to get a copy)! the movie was brilliant in its own way, in that it blended humor into a t&a movie loaded with playboy playmates! unlike most skin flicks, it did have a plot. that, however, is not exactly why you would watch h.o.t.s.<br /><br />h.o.t.s. is a college movie that reminds me of the revenge of the nerds movies, in that it takes a group of "average people" and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people can't stand! the only difference is that the "nerds" in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid! i notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low, and to me that is ignorant! obviously this is not intended to win oscars or break barriers in film. if you are looking for that, then go watch what ever the critics pick for you! you have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot, decent acting (for the most part given the genre), and plenty of girls getting naked! h.o.t.s. is one of those movies you watch to get your mind off of modern day problems and daily stress, and instead, laugh and have a good time! if you are looking for a funny college-based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink miata straight, then you should really check out h.o.t.s.!
