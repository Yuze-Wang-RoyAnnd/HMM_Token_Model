this is the best version of gypsy that has been filmed.bette midler is simply superb as mama rose.she has the voice,the gestures,the look,and most of all,a supreme acting ability to carry the role off and to make her character come alive.her singing is,simply put:magnificent! she especially shines in two numbers-"everything's coming up roses" and "rose's turn". the other actors are also fine,particularly christine ebersoll as tessie.also good is peter riegert;his portrayal of herbie is acted with great style and believability.the direction of this movie is very,very good.there isn't a false note or gaffe in the entire production.this film is a vast improvement over the roz russell version filmed in 1962.since viewing it again,i can state that the three greatest mama roses are:ethel merman,bette midler,and angela lansbury. see this movie.you'll be glad that you did.
