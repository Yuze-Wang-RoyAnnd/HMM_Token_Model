as an earlier reviewer said, travolta stole every scene he was in. recognize the character? it was vinnie barberino, all grown up and still a bit sleazy, but still likable, oh yes! <br /><br />disappointing were william hurt and bob hoskins, perhaps because their characters were badly written, or they just didn't care. i kept seeing one of the baldwins (never can remember which) in the hurt role so hurt's incredible talents weren't wasted. <br /><br />andie mcdowell is a sweetie, but not very believable; partly the writing. character development just wasn't a big thing in this film. just watch it for travolta, sit back and enjoy.
