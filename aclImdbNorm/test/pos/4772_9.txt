spoilers <br /><br />as you may know, i have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in the past months. now, i have no idea why i am commenting on steamboat willie, i guess i was just desperate to comment on anything, so i watched this, and now i am commenting on it. this, or course, is one of the very first cartoons, and i believe it is not the first cartoon with sound. <br /><br />here is the plot. mickey mouse is driving a steamboat when pete throws him off and he drives it. when they stop for cargo minnie mouse tried to get on but failed miserably. mickey gets her up by a crane. then a goat eats her sheet of paper with turkey in the straw on it. they use the goat to make the song. when i say that i mean that they used the goat as a victrola. mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song. then an angry pete throws mickey in a potato room and mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day.<br /><br />overall, this is yet another groundbreaking silent short film. i mean, this is the third mickey mouse cartoon. yes, the third. also, this is not the first cartoon with sound. i believe there were two more before this one. either way, this film is really, really groundbreaking. mikcey was also more violent than he is mow. i mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it. <br /><br />9/10<br /><br />recommended films: plane crazy.
