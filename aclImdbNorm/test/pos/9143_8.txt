china white (1989) was ronny yu's first international film. this u.k,/holland/hong kong production was shot in english and was slightly edited for the western audience. the american wong brothers (michael and russell) were supposed to star in the film together but due to prior commitments was unavailable so another western actor steven leigh took his spot. several hong kong stars such as tommy wong (playing a mute) and the always creepy william ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo spot.<br /><br />the chow brothers are in holland to run the family business. they want to the family business to go legit but the other asian gangs don't want to and see there move as a face saving move to please the "foreigners" and want to keep on making money the old fashion way. others want to take their business to even a new low by smuggling drugs and what not. after the chow elder is gunned down in cold blood, the brothers make their move against any family who's not with them. can the chow family keep the families from killing one another or while the streets of holland flow with the blood of the innocence and gangsters?<br /><br />a highly underrated movie. i was surprised by how good it was. i haven't seen the hong kong version. that would be a huge treat for me. it's longer and has a lot more stars of the hong kong cinema involved with the production. too bad this film isn't available on d.v.d. the video print i saw was washed out and the sound reproduction wasn't that great.<br /><br />highly recommended for action fans.<br /><br />factoid: this film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /><br />in holland.
