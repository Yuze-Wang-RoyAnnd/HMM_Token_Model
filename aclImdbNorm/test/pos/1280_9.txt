it is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. following is one such look into the past of christopher nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.<br /><br />christopher nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, i still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time. memento was probably the most convoluted piece of story-telling i have ever seen. discount the hardened cynics who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing. memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mind-bender. the prestige, which was considerably stripped down in comparison, still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven. even in a jaded enterprise like the batman series did christopher nolan sprinkle some of his outstanding yarn-weaving tricks, breathing new life into the dark knight.<br /><br />following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery, where we see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unknowing accomplice to a variety of petty crimes, and finally sees an end no one could have expected. having never heard of following before, i had no idea what i was to expect. at every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me. since the mystery angle was clear, i was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next. and that is where i think the film succeeds so well. the film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases.<br /><br />the film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple timelines, both of which are considered gimmicky these days. following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible. there doesn't seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is, but you don't feel like you are being taken for a ride. the lack of pretension or self-aware arrogance is what makes this style of story-telling work. highly recommended!
