the wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture. it is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more.<br /><br />connery, despite the thick scottish brogue, plays the raisulu very well. he inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot.<br /><br /> candice bergen, in one of her early roles, is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite mrs. pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and plenty of humour as well). a marvelous film, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.
