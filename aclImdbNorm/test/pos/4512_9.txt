it was amazing. as a librarian and an attendee at the new york library association's vitality fund event on thursday night, october 18, i was privileged to see a pre-release screening of the new movie, the kite runner. the release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved. i am grateful that the nyla event was allowed to go on as planned.<br /><br />regarding the movie, i feel it was masterfully done. it had as much impact on me, i think, as stanley kubrik's a clockwork orange, even though it is much less graphic - much less. there is no comparison between the horrendous, shocking violence and rape shown in a clockwork orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in kite runner; only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (i have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my myspace blog.) my overall impression was that this film was fantastic; one of the best-made films i have seen. the depiction of the afghani boys flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. the subject matter is intensely serious, and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring "hollywood touches" which have ruined other movies. although the overturned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism (to me).<br /><br />finally, i must mention the excellence of the sound track. the recitation by the boy of poetry by rumi as two main characters are fleeing the country during the russian invasion - under terrifying circumstances - truly showed the power of those poems. i urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can, and just listen to the beauty of the language. i don't even know what language amir is quoting, whether his normal dari persian dialect is the same as rumi's original persian dialect. also, please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. i found it a profound, distinctive sound, though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. i can't help but wonder if kites actually make a sound like that when they are "cut", or if it gives a sense of the vibration/sound experienced by the kite flyer during competition.
