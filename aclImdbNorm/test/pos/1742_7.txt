i was really beginning to enjoy this show. it just started out slow and it wasn't given the chance it deserved. it is summertime so many people are not at home watching television. i know there are a few talent and singing competitions but i enjoy them as do many other. believe it or not when american idol is done for the year i miss it. even though this was not american idol i thought it had potential. i feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me. i wish they would reconsider and put the show back on. i think it was a hasty move to cancel. my only complaint about the show is i did not care to much for the judges.
