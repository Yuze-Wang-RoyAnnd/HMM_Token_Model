as a child growing up in the sydney of the 1950s, i can readily identify with the content of this fine film. each week i visited the wynyard newsreel cinema on george street to watch the cinesound (and usually 3 stooges) shorts. never has there been a better blending of b/w and colour in a film. faultless production values round off a never to be forgotten movie experience.
