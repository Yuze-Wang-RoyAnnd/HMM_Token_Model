in 1968 when, "symbiopsychotaxiplasm: take one", was released, it came from out of nowhere, and struck like a psychedelic thunder bolt. afro-american actor and film maker, william greaves, aimed to forever alter the 'news-reel' style of documentary film-making, and to this day, there has never been anything quite like it. the movie is a film about 'the making of a film', and intentionally written and directed so as to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. set in new york's central park, the action and scant dialog concern a couple who fight and bicker about homosexuality and abortion. the woman wants out of the relationship, and the man wants an explanation. near the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless man interrupts the proceedings and offers his commentary, and personal back-story. then, after the principle footage has been shot, the film crew add their own views of the film-maker and what they feel is his inept handling of the movie. and during the entire film, multiple cameras are employed to record the action within the scene, and extraneous commentary by cast, crew, and onlookers. i would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in avant garde film makers such as andy warhol, john cassavetes, or jim jarmusch. william greaves attempts to show that a thing cannot be truly observed and understood because the viewing itself would alter the reality. "symbiopsychotaxiplasm: take one" can be seen as a cinematic representation or application of the uncertainty principle. this is only one possible explanation, and greave's true intent is certainly open for speculation. above all else, this film seeks to confound, confront. and stimulate, and without a doubt, succeeds admirably.
