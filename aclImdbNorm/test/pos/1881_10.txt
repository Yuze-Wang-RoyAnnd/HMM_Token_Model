normally, i do not review online, but it's saturday and i'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and xena: warrior princess (i can't get the damned 'joxer the mighty' song out of my head, it's been there for the past ten years or so, just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). if you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have any idea how much of an idiot you look like? if you expect more out of bruce campbell than what he puts out (in the most literal sense) than why in g-d's holy name do you watch his movies? no one watches a bruce campbell movie when they want to see something genius and intelligible, we watch them so we feel better about ourselves (like those people who watch jerry springer and eat chunky monkey), and to be easily entertained by mindless psycho-babble. i, personally, love bruce campbell movies. i'm not a complete idiot, in fact, i see myself as an intellectual and a scholar(haha, shut up, ally). his movies reflect insane, random, quirky, ridiculous ideals which anyone with a brain, screaming or no, can enjoy. that, and he was kind of sexy on xena: warrior princess, even with the facial hair. i rate this movie an excellent 10, just because i can. if you can't take simplistic plot-schemes (if any), hot babes in sci-fi splendor(leather, spandex), and familiar if not exhausted views of insanity, then fer cryin' out loud, don't watch the movie(or any that so much as mention the name bruce campbell). oh yeah, ted raimi was awesome in this movie! way to go ted! you did the best with what you had. ;|
