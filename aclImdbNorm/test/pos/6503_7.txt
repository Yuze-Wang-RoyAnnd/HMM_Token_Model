this film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntableism, as was the case with the director before he started this film. it was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected, because ny is always getting all the credit, but comin from the bay the q-bert worship is a little out of control. this film didn't introduce anything new to me, but it did change my opinion in that going into it i was sketchy about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument. this film ought to convince anyone that it's right up there with the viola and clavichord.
