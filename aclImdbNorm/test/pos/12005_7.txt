and i do. peter falk has created a role that will live on forever in tv land! and i'm grateful for that. this isn't one of his finest hours, though. columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime, and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is. what all us fans know is that columbo needs a worthy opponent. without a great enemy, how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? still, it's better than no columbo, and i'll wait and watch the next one as well.
