a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batman:tas and its ilk, i enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from tim curry, richard moll, tony jay, and maurice lamarche in various roles. the only qualm i had was rob paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending. some people say it was a cop-out, but i found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging. hopefully one day they put this series out on dvd, unfortunately it came out at a time when dvd's weren't yet prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy, which i never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon.
