aristocats is such a terrific disney classic that i just loved so much as a kid. still to this day i can't resist watching it, it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs. i really miss the animation films like aristocats, they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. aristocats is also very witty and clever, the story was just so wonderful. this film is just beyond irresistible, i think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio's, lol, it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting.<br /><br />douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children. but when the lady feels it's time to make her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. the butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where. douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of thomas o'malley, they head back home to their lady, but learn the coolness of being a skat cat.<br /><br />the aristocats is just a perfect disney movie that i feel is a bit over looked. i would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families, it could be enjoyed by anyone. the songs and story is just memorable. i will always join in for the movies best song "everybody wants to be a cat", such a great tune. i also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were just so cute. this is a terrific film, please watch it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />9/10
