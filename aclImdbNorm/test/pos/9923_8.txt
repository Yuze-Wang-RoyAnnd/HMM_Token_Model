'opera' (1987) <br /><br />director: dario argento (deep red, suspiria) screenplay: dario argento and franco ferrini (the church, sleepless, demons) photography: ronnie taylor (a chorus line, sleepless) music: claudio simonetti (phenomena, 'goblin')<br /><br />story: betty (cristina marsillach) is the lady macbeth understudy of a very stylized staging of verdi's macbeth opera. betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum. the famous curse of macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when right away the body count begins to rise. it seems betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her. story: 3 of 5<br /><br />acting: acting in a lot of these italian films can sometimes be hard to judge. english, italian, french, german, spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge. i usually cut them some slack in the area as a result. acting: 4 of 5 <br /><br />direction: giallo maestro argento enters again the genre helped pioneer. 'opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore, tension and beauty. direction: 4 of 5<br /><br />visual: this has to be one of argento's best looking films. gorgeously filmed by taylor, 'opera' features some stunning and inventive camera-work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye-candy coming. the camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of said bird circling the crowd at the opera house. visual: 5 of 5<br /><br />audio: frequent argento collaborator simonetti (through his various bands goblin, demonian and solo effort) compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical (verdi) to metal musings (with a little help from brian and roger eno and bill wyman) and lends music muscle to the screen's bloody gristle. the sound design give you all that you need from stabbings to gunshots, fire to screams and masterfully remastered on the anchor bay disc in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw. audio: 5 of 5<br /><br />technical: the editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully. combined with the camera-work, the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing. the exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of macbeth. one can't end a review of an argento film without having to comment on the kills. argento dispatches characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence, crow eye-gouging and the film highlight of a gun blast through a keyhole into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends argento's ex-wife daria nicolodi to the movie morgue. priceless! technical: 5 of 5<br /><br />wrap-up: a nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that argento fans crave.<br /><br />overall: 4 of 5
