one of the classic low budget 70's movies, this film was found in a bargain video shop in london for only 50p. (interestingly, the package lists the star of the film as 'charles bone', who sounds like a porn star, but once the credits role it's obvious that the picture is aligned to far the right of the tv screen, so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their names)<br /><br />from the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation that the desperate tenants of a grimy new york city apartment block, you know you're in for a rollercoaster ride of fromage. the direction is from the 'ed wood one-take' school - if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew, then what the hell?<br /><br />the films finishes with a plot twist that puts the usual suspects to shame. buy it now.
