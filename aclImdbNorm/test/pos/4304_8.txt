this is my favourite columbo. martin landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. this columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! peter falk is on form as usual in this episode written by steven bochco (who also wrote 'murder by the book', my second favourite episode). the supporting cast are great especially julie newmar (very under-rated) and jeanette nolan as the house keeper that columbo just keeps on upsetting. the surname of martin landau's characters in this is 'paris'. that was the surname of leonard nimoy's character in mission impossible. coincidence? or a steven bochco joke?
