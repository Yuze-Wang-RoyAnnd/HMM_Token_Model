i think this is the best norwegian movie i've ever seen. it's about 40-year old andreas who gets hit by a subway-train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, however, everything here has been made ready for him. he has got a job, a house and clothes. at first, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. everywhere there are men in gray suits who cleans up and fixes everything that doesn't fit into their definition of perfect. however andreas can't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world, and tries with all means to get back. <br /><br />the thing that impresses my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so surrealistic, even though i have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant. another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors. trond fausa aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome andreas. and all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing apathetic (sounds like a hard job, doesn't it?). the strong difference between andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well. <br /><br />all in all, this is a fabulous movie. the plot may be a little confusing, but the movie has such a great atmosphere i would recommend that everyone should go see it. <br /><br />and i wouldn't recommend listening to "ccscd212", as it seems he has seen too many commercial american movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate. the way i see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong. i consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking. but sure, everyone can see a film in their own way.
