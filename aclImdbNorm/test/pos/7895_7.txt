"joe" is one of those movies where, although you think that it might go along smoothly, ends up hitting you like...i can't come up with an analogy. it showed not only that america's long-standing idea of unity was moot, but also the various aspects within our society. melissa compton (susan sarandon) is the ultimate flower child, while her father bill (dennis patrick) is a clean-cut executive. one day, bill accidentally kills melissa's boyfriend. in the immediate aftermath, bill gets acquainted with joe curran (peter boyle), an ultra-right-wing, rabidly racist working stiff. as a result, the two of them end up associating more and more with the hippies, whom bill finds unpleasant and joe outright hates. but in the end, everything has dead serious consequences.<br /><br />true, some parts of the movie are a little bit dated, but it's a good juxtaposition of america's two sides during the vietnam war. and rest assured, the residual effects of all that will probably never go away.
