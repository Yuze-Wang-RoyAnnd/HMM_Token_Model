in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life. the highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer. not content with this forever, jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people. how many people will be interested in a loner 20-something who's best friend is a cat?<br /><br />after several failed attempts at getting a girl, including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals david brents' fusion of flashdance and mc hammer in the office (disco's dead?, says jon), he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself. <br /><br />naturally, they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat. fortunately jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /><br />with slicker animation than past tv specials, this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends.
