context is everything when one goes to rate a movie. when rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made. we didn't really know what the inside of the earth was in those days so you can't rag on the movie too much for the plot (based on a much older book). for the era, this was top notch special effects and the production quality was great. i watched this movie in a masterfully restored hd master. for the time the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible as a monster-thing. this is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits, models, and creepy costumes. awesome. ps doug mcclure rocks!
