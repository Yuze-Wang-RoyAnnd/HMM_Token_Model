having seen only once and in the dawn hours, i can't seem to forget this haunting film. a mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of vertigo.the actors, though not that well known are good especially joan hackett in one of her best performances.you believe in her, in her love,in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain.the plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. the direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect. and it has one message: don't let revenge blind you, you can became its last victim.a real pity it has not been remade, but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone.
