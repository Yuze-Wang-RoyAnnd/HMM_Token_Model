the sea inside a film by alejandro amenabar.<br /><br />almodovar has always single handed the flag for spanish cinema for years now, out of nowhere came amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag? this is the story of ramon sampedro, a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the spanish government for the right to end his life. the story has the traces of an afternoon made for tv melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades. mateo gil and amenabar co-write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time liberty. there is a few laughs spare a long the way, like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out, punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie. it is a heartbreaking experience specially when sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die
