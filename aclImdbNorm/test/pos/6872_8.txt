house calls was an amusing 1978 comedy about a widowed doctor (walter matthau) who now wants to play the field but can't help but be drawn to a patient of his (glenda jackson) who refuses to be just another notch on his bedpost. matthau likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that she insists upon so he agrees to date her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision as to whether or not he wants to commit; however, other complications make it difficult for matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are up, even though he is clearly in love with the woman. matthau and jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and are given strong support from richard benjamin, candice azzara, dick o'neill, and especially art carney as the inept and senile chief of staff at the hospital where matthau is employed. matthau even has a brief scene with his real-life son, charlie, who appears as jackson's son. this engaging comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years. if you've never seen it, it's worth the rental.
