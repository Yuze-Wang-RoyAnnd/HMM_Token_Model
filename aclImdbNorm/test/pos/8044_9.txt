the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character, rather than star turns, the need to stage special effects, obligatory romance, and endless car chases. however, there is a car chase in here, and a dandy it is. aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer "recruited" to eliminate him. it is rare that a second or third tier actor, such as quinn, is given an important starring role like this that carries a film. usually, such a role is given to an a-list actor with box office draw, which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it. donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous, somewhat creepy at times, agent that recruits quinn. ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent. the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines, which converge in gradual fashion toward the end, and not all at once as we're used to seeing. the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. the locations are convincing and effective. the soundtrack is nothing special, but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days, without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud, annoying, music video type soundtracks; a villain that hams it up; and repeatedly a cast, costumes, and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25. this is an outstanding thriller, which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release. ***1/2 of 4 stars.
