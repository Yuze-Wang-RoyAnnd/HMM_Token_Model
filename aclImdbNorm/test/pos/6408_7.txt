compared to this, tarkovsky is a speed freak.<br /><br />compared to this, bela tarr is mtv.<br /><br />compared to this, the movie "russian ark" is a roller-coaster ride.<br /><br />i've just described 3 of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences i've ever known, and this one tops them all. but that's not saying it's bad. on the contrary, i really liked it. but it was a chore.<br /><br />i won't describe the plot, because you can easily find that elsewhere. suffice it to say that the plot is insane. it's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since "becoming john malkovich". i believe the interesting plot is the main reason i kept from nodding off (also, the humour was nice. that's something we rarely see in slow, artsy films).<br /><br />here we see a bizarre reversal of the norm. most movies have little plot & little substance; yet they fill 90 mins with a lot of eyecatching images to keep us enthralled. but "the hole" has 100% plot/theme without much to please the eyes. in that respect, i suppose it's a truly intellectual experience, much like reading a painfully verbose novel like thackaray's "vanity fair" (which i've never been able to finish!).<br /><br />if you have a tremendous attention span, i think you'll really like this film. despite its molassessy pace, it's highly creative and imaginative. it's like jean-pierre jeunet on quaaludes and with a drab, dusty camera lens. best of luck.
