at first glance of this mini... i was a bit disappointed that tommy lee jones and anjelica huston didn't return to the cast. both john voight and barbara hershey did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary epic western. <br /><br />cherokee jack jackson (haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and louis gossett jr. was, as always, true to form with his excellent acting skills.<br /><br />the drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the valiant shoot-out ended with ranger walker being killed made me feel that i was actually in the film. return to lonesome dove was to me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. the next 2 follow ups with james garner as call just didn't make it for me. and that lorena marries pea eye? how the heck did that get in their? that was a total mismatch of characters. the first 2 of the series made the epic story, the next 2 in no way were of the same quality.<br /><br />now, if the first 2 could be remastered in dolby digital and an anamorphic presentation, the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today.
