ok, when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations. yes, the acting isn't great, and the picture itself looks dated, but as i sat there, a strange thing happened. i started to like it. the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. brion james, maybe one of the greatest b-grade actors next to bruce campbell, is great as always. the story isn't bad either. now i wouldn't rush out and buy it, but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b-grade post apocalyptic western.
