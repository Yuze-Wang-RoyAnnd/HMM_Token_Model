if you are looking for a movie that doesn't take itself seriously... than haggard is for you. i must say before i write anything more, that if you have not seen any of the cky (camp kill yourself) videos than the movie most likely won't be as funny. my advice is to watch a few clips of those videos that bam and his friends made. haggard does not take itself seriously at all, and that was never the purpose. throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control. even through all that the plot does stay focused and the story of ryan dunn's character does unfold quite nicely. this plot i have been told is based off a true story (for the most part)of ryan dunn's ex-girlfriend. brandon dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie. he has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. he stole the movie if you ask me. overall i love this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness. its a bam movie people, its not going to be normal. haggard is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and i constantly used since the first time we saw it. i've seen the movie 6-7 times and still find new things every time. the soundtrack is just as good. everything from gnar kill to new order and some techno. just don't go into the movie with high expectations, let it all unfold and then judge it for what it is.
