i tend to like historical (period) films and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group, and a friend recommended this one to me. i like johnny lee miller as an actor so i figured it was worth it, and i was definitely rewarded!! his portrayal as a member of the english noble class was by far more accurate than i've seen in the past. the comedy aspect of it left my sides hurting, the costumes weren't awful, and historically, i didn't wince too much. i also noticed the fact that england didn't have a proper sewage system until much later, but anyone who dose not go deep into the minutae of england's past won't notice nor care. absolutely worth seeing. i highly recommend this movie.
