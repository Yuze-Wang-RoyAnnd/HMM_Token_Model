i was delighted when i saw that my husband rented "labyrinth of passion". i love almodovar's films. we both loved the movie. we both couldn't stop laughing. we especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel, and while supposedly being menaced by a killer with an electric drill, is told to answer the phone and say, "i can't talk to you right now, i'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer. if i survive i will call you back". (that would make a great answering machine message come to think of it). we also loved the lady telling her new found beloved, "i went to an orgy after the concert but i couldn't stop thinking of you." (i'm waiting to use that line on twitter). "labyrinth of passion" is a rollicking farce with plenty of high jinks, hilarious dialog and eye candy for everyone. the film has aged well: the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness. i would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but i am giving it a 8 for two reasons. the first is the scene which involves laxatives which includes a shot of a lady soiling herself: totally unnecessary, and it brings down the tone of the film to hollywood gross-out comedy for a moment. the second is the suggestion that queti is sleeping with her father: shocking, yes, but again, it ruins the tone of the film. still, i would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy, and fun time.
