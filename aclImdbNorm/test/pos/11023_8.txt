wow! i caught this on ifc recently after i watched but im a cheerleader. id never heard of this movie but the description sounded remotely interesting. i went in with low expectations and now i must say this is one of the best love stories ever in film. robin tunney does an excellent job portraying a person with tourettes. the relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so acurate and believable. i usually hate "romance" and love films but this movie truly touched me. i so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision.
