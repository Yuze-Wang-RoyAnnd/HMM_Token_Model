i've seen the 1973 movie lost horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. i agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, i was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. i watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what i got. you can be critical of the acting the singing, and dialog but that't not what i look for when i go to a movie. i look for a little release from my daily life, a little time where i can sit back and imagine a better life, where people love another and help another. it's a shame we can't we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an english teacher reading a fifth grade essay. this may be very simplistic, but really, wouldn't it be nice.
