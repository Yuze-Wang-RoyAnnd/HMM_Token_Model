this movie is really sick, and funny. i have made my friends cringe describing it to them. i saw it about 8 months ago, and i still have the song 'shall we gather at the river' echoing through my head.<br /><br />so basically, it is a tromatized romeo and juliet, but it goes beyond what you would expect. let's just say incest, references to child molestation, gore (of course), but unfortunately, has a sort of happy ending...sort of...it's more weird than happy. cappy capulet was brilliant! he has this sort of intellectual snobbish tone, he's abusive, but civilised. he quotes more shakespeare than anyone else in the film...all while engaging in his sadistic role as a husband and father.<br /><br />the meat guy was pretty cool too. he was juliet's fianc'e, deeply infatuated with her, and soon to be heartbroken because of tromeo. and tromeo, a true romantic. he's a handsome, really sweet guy, desperate to find true love. 'she doth make torches to burn brightly!' unfortunately, troma just had to resort to that awful fake green vomit and their other antics. they really get carried away with that stuff sometimes. but hey, this film made a great impression on me. how often do i refer to it in real life situations...wow that's pathetic.<br /><br />anyway, enjoy!
