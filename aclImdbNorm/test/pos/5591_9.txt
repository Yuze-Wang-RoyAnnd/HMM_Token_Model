this story of the troubles caused by an over-possessive, overpowering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (laura hope crews) for her two grown sons, and their girls, is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by irene dunn (the new daughter-in-law), joel mccrea (the number-one son), eric linden (the number-two son) and frances dee (fiance of number-two son). here's the show of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and possessiveness run amok as four good people find their owns lives damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in jeopardy. irene dunn is stellar in her role. joel mccrea's performance is open and clear and laura hope crews is masterful as the mother.<br /><br />yet this reviewer finds frances dee's performance the best of all. hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings. her portrayal in her heartbreak broken-engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face ! <br /><br />frances dee, like laura hope crews, has been too long overlooked, and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. no actress who started in film after wwii has had anything to speak of on frances dee.<br /><br />if you're lucky enough to see the silver cord, which was never released for tv, you'll find this "old fashioned drawing-room drama" to be an outstanding film that shows very well 74 years after its 1933 release because it is filled with superb performances.
