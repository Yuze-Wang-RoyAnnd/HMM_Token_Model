i will always think of mr. firth as dorian gray, if i live to be 100.<br /><br />perfectly acted and directed, bringing oscar wilde's insight, wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television.<br /><br />more proof that the bbc more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money.<br /><br />a must have for all wilde fans-and indeed for everyone else. inspired and perfected, every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done.<br /><br />by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. watch it, then try to watch another version. it's just not the same, is it?
