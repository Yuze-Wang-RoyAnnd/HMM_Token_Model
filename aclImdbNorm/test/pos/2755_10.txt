in my opinion, flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. he was disrespectful to his dancing partner, tried to upstage everyone and had no awareness of the spirit of riverdance. it's well he left the show. colin dunne, the new male lead, is superb, and when he and jean butler dance together, magic happens! eileen ivers' fiddling is astonishing (as is noel eccles' percussion,) and maria pages' "fire dance" is worth the price of admission! when pages and ivers get together, near the end of the show for a musical duet, well, it's a genuine treasure. i agree, the editing isn't complimentary, but no technical shortcoming can quell this extraordinary tour de force. this is the one to get. there's never been anything like riverdance! this is the real one!
