i loved this movie when i was a kid. i saw it theatrically. randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack. david seville is the chipmunks' father and recording manager. the chipmunks consist of alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, simon, who is a bright and studious chipmunk & theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. there is a lady known as miss miller, who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany, jeanette & eleanor, who all have the same character as the chipmunks. my favourite songs from this soundtrack include "diamond dolls", the girls of rock & roll", & the touching "my mother". alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business. the chipmunks meet the chipettes playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing.
