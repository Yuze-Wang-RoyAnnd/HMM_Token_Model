i had heard of john garfield, but, didn't know him. i loved this movie. i had never heard of it. i just picked it up randomly. john garfield is a boxer in the movie. he had been in real life also so he knew his part. he was a fugitive throughout the movie. someone else killed a man. he character was blamed. he is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. all sorts of minor plots ensue. my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldn't swim, and none of them could get out.john's character saves the day. the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers. one of them right to the very end. ann sheridan played the family's daughter and john's eventual love interest. she was believable, but not lovable in my opinion-the only weak link in the movie.
