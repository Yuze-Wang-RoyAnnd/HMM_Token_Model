okay so i love aidan quinn's acting even with a bad script. this is not the case in the assignment. as other viewers have said, this was a movie i stumbled upon on cable and got so into it i didn't want it to end. take one cuban american navy ofc.(quinn)who is an upright, uptight soldier and family man. add a crazed agent(donald sutherland) who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a ben kingsley and you have "the assignment". sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist carlos actions in a cafe on a lovely day where he is so profoundly rocked at this mans evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man as long as he draws breath.<br /><br />take one soldier on a pass in israel who is a dead ringer for this man and is beaten and held by kingsley until they realize they have a plan. by taking on carlos by being him, or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him, makes for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip. by not helping his country he is bound as a man and his military duty to chose wisely. so the training begins. lets say carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and holocausts. when i say this intense and wonderfully casted,scripted and executed film rates the best, i am not understating it. all three actors could save almost any script..together this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credits. i am not into terrorism or movies about it but i got hooked! bravo again to aidan quinn who for once plays a heavy that could hold up to any actor including gary oldman. thats a compliment. rent it and get lots of popcorn. oh did i mention the sex?? it works better than "last tango!"and its educational.
