on account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere, i have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series, although i certainly would not mind, and trust me, i have looked. for anyone who does not know, this is a point-and-click adventure title. that means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything that you can do so with in this, though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate. i won't spoil it here, for anyone who haven't yet tried it. nevertheless, regardless of how little experience you have with computers, you can sit right down and try this. there isn't even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes. heck, you can adjust the speed of the text(if you have it have subtitles on), and thus, of the talking in it, and it's not enormously awkward or forced when slow. accessing your inventory is easy, as well as combining or using items. clicking and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three options for what to use with it(be it a person, a specific part of the surroundings or an object): hand(push, pick up, open, etc.), eyes(examine, look through, etc.) and mouth(eat, converse, etc.). this all adds up to a welcoming, friendly environment, where you can approach the plentiful puzzles(the amount of them is varied, based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on) at your own pace, and explore and take in the dozens of individual, creatively done characters and areas in this to your heart's content. the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do such(you'll hear no blame from me, they're worth it), and your skill at figuring out the solutions. there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not. this can be enjoyed by anyone, from any age. there's no material that isn't acceptable for children. this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences. the animation is quality work, smooth, everything moves as it should, and the 3rd dimension honestly isn't that sorely missed when trying this. the story-telling is well-done, and you're never unclear as to what is going on. there are numerous well-directed cut-scenes, kept in the same colorful, mostly bright 2d world as the rest, with well-done camera motion. "cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe this, and not only the visual style. it can be applied to all of this. the entire world of this is very similar to, but not quite the same as, ours, with a mix of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of, but the absurdity makes them funny. that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this, right there: it's hilarious. a lot of that comes from the lines spoken(what is said as well as how it is), and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal, the likes of 'allo 'allo or the blackadder franchise will want to check this sucker out. however, there are several different types of jokes, including, but not limited to the following: satire, cleverness, dark, spoofs, irony, gross-out comedy(not exactly my favorite aspect of this) and more. there's self-awareness, with the lead addressing you, personally, and, for example, explaining why he isn't going to do what you just asked him to. there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades. almost all of it works, hardly any gags fall flat, and if you aren't in stitches during this, my best guess as to the reason would be that it's simply not compatible with your sense of humor... a situation that warrants no judgment, and if one suspects that could be the case, and wishes to find out, i suggest the demo version, where you, for free, can see if you care for the brand of play and/or laughter. the plot is well-written(nearly all of this is, really), develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well. the audio is all excellent, crisp and well-done. the sound effects are spot-on. the music is well-composed with no exceptions. the voice acting is impeccable, with a celebrity or two. armato is fantastic as guybrush threepwood(gotta love that name), whom you control. boen is incredible as lechuck, the deceased(and still threatening) zombie villain. the designs are immensely well-done, highly imaginative and all fit. in spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds, you do get to engage in some. steer a ship, board that of others, and match blades in a rather unique, and marvelously thought up, way. the re-playability lies mainly in the choices, during dialog, etc. this is linear, with a tad freedom as far as the order goes, so the buccaneer sitting down with this, for at least the second time, has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes, unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime. ah, nothing is perfect. anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly well-crafted and fascinating fictional universe, and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this. the good kind, not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises. don't forget, kids, do *not* eat books... that is just begging for a paper-cut. i would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one, too. and they're not the only ones who may get into this. i recommend this to, apart from members of aforementioned group, any fan of this genre of vgs, as well as anyone to whom this review appeals. 8/10
