i've seen this movie more than once. it isn't the greatest scifi flick i've every seen, but it is not a bad movie. the acting is good and the characters are more "real" than most in low budget sci fi. (at least it isn't full of dumb bimbos like so many other low budget scifi.) i especially like elizabeth pena. she is a good actress and she does worried single mother as well as any and better than some.<br /><br />don't let the nay sayers run you off. see it for yourself and judge it for yourself.
