after many, many years i saw again this beautiful love story, thinking about how would i, half a century after, react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time, when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women's behaviors, in a small city in brazil.<br /><br />this time, however, what caught my attention in the film was something very different, namely the insistence with which the physician dr. han suyin (jennifer jones) makes clear to the journalist mark elliott (william holden) her special ethically condition as an eurasian. in fact, she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship, repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a "occidental way", provided that, by doing so, she is not betraying her chinese side. its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them.<br /><br />therefore, suyin's attitudes always leave poor elliott
