look as being anglo-irish i assure you this reviewer is anything but bias. but i assure you this is very much an irish film - and not english as the last comment seems to have suggested. this film was written by neil jorden and conor mcpherson and directed by conor mcpherson too - both irish. the cast is almost entirely irish - it was shot in ireland with an irish crew. even michael gambon was born in ireland - i remember him joking about it in an interview about this film.<br /><br />michael cane was evidently brought in to boost box office takings abroad.<br /><br />loved the film, i just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment!<br /><br />now on with the review - i loved dylan moran, have always been a fan of his, himself and michael cane formed a surprisingly good double act. it was great to see morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film. i would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy - as it represents a fresh, quirky and inventive turn in irish feature length chuckle films. i laughed a lot. what more could you ask for?
