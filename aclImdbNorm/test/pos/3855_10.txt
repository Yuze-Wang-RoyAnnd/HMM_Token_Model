this is one of my favourite disney films. it has everything you could hope for in a disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. the story begins in paris, where aristocat duchess and her three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion. life is perfect for them until the mistress' fiendish butler edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. he realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way. an excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's - a time when the disney studio made few animations - which features songs such as the title number "the aristocats" as well as "ev'rybody wants to be a cat", this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness.
