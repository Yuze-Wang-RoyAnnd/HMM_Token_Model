if you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place. it is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters. it is always hard for me to see mark walhberg as anything except marky mark. that image is burned in my mind forever. as an actor though he is pretty good. this movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns. i will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it.
