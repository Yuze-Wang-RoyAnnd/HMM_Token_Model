life is crazy. you're crazy, i'm crazy, we're all crazy. we're all a little bit minnie, and a little bit moskowitz. sometimes it does seem best to be sensible...but then what might you be missing out on?<br /><br />you gotta be you. you don't have to park cars and semi-randomly yell at people, but you can't hide yourself behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything is okay. and sometimes, you really do have to throw caution to the wind, because why else are you alive?<br /><br />i'm not going to 'rate' this love compared to cassavetes' other movies, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives. in that sense they are all great, and comparisons are odious. for sure, this movie has that one crazy, sometimes maddening, but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have- you never know what's going to happen next, and you never know what the characters are going to think, do, or feel next. neither do the characters themselves- and do we really want to live our lives any other way? unlike moskowitz, you can have a great job and judiciously sock away money into your ira, but still live the life of an adventurer inside- in your feelings, your spirit, and your very experience of life. yeah, we can have it both ways, that's what cassavetes shows us. thank god somebody did.
