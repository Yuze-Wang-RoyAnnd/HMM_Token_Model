i have been away from istanbul for the last 10 years. during that time i constantly lived in london. when i have seen the movie i realised how much i am istanbuler. i am not just from turkey i am a part of turkey. one of my part is istanbul, the sound of the istanbul, the people of the istanbul.<br /><br />probably faith akin thought that he has done great musical documentary but i must say it is more than that. it is about putting nice blend of vastly different musics, cultures, approaches, politics, ethnics into a delicious pot...<br /><br />as we all know turkey to be precise istanbul is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city. as one of the band member said istanbul is a bi-cultural city. but much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city. it shows we've never been one.<br /><br />this movie will catch from very first second. music is excellent, people are fascinating. especially aynur and sezen aksu. singers, band members! it is nice to see you all at a small cinema in wood green.
