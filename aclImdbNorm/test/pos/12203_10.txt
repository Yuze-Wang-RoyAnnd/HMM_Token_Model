a new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat. lake bell is wonderful..it is to bad that her other show "miss match" was canceled. i am just glad she came back on "surface". i can't wait for the return of "surface". this show is really something unique to watch. with an eerie underwater world that is akin to jurassic park, this show keeps you wondering what is next. nim is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous. there are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects. when something like "surface" comes along you just have to say "thank you!".
