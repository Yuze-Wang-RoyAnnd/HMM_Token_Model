there was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful - probably the length of them. unfortunately this lacks the charm, but it still ends up being a fun film. <br /><br />the bright, shimmering side is that our favourite plasticene figures are still doing a cracking great job, there is good plasticene animation used, there is a silly, but well-structured and entertaining plot, an exciting, fun adventure, a good plot idea (a were-rabbit and a giant vedgetable competition) and good new characters!<br /><br />as well as lacking the original charm, the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour, though good, is slightly overdone, especially compared to the original films.<br /><br />the popular giant vedgetable competition is drawing near and wallace and gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any vedgetables, now they are anti pesto. they are doing a good job, but soon, there is danger afoot. a were-rabbit is nearby...<br /><br />recommended to all wallace and gromit fans and to people who like plasticene films, enjoy "wallace and gromit: the curse of the wererabbit"! :-)
