logan lerman & dean collins iii of jack & bobby fame provide a nice touch of familiarity as friends in this even if not maybe as close as they may be on jack & bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie.logan lerman may be seemingly typecast in roles of being "different" as thusly seen from here as is seen in this as well as in jack and bobby.the movie also opens up with a very nice tune coined as a lost 45 "and i'm wondering where the lions are?"a song which i'd always heard on the speaker @ my old job of christmastreeshops and got it played on my local radio show of the lost45s hosted by barry scott but the last time of which i suggested this with this movie as it's dedication but the dedication was left out.environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this movie too for the protection of the ground owls as seen in this movie too.what a hoot too this movie is.hoot,sogive a hoot in the tradition of the woodsey owl commercials of the 1970s too. truthfully, stephen "steve" g. baer a.k.a."ste".
