watching some of the sequences (err, the entire 1/3 of the film devoted to the battle on the ice) in alexander nevsy, a film directed by the russian legend sergei m. eisenstein (co-directed by dmitri vasilyev in his only significant credit), made me realize how much must really go into directing, at least on a scale such as this. if i were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release i probably would award eisenstein with the director's award of the year, posthumously. it is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film, though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work- battleship potemkin and october- it could have been something he scoffed at at first. but amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come in to the black and white subject matter, it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later. lord of the rings fans, meet the films' grandfather, so to speak.<br /><br />to say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it, and often a bad one. it is something that has a full-blown message to it, and a point of view. it's still a matter of hot debate (see the swarms of argument over moore's films for proof), about whether great art can come out of something that is point-blank meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner. in this particular case, the russians against the germans. at the time it was nearing ww2 and russia once again faced the 'german invaders', and it's interesting to note that eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film, as a rallying call for the russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history. the end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing battleship and october, however; if nothing else comes through those films it's that eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together finitely for the viewer, that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail. on those terms alexander nevsky is fearless. <br /><br />but even with the whole idea of 'russia great, germans bad', there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent, a little less strict to these ideals. for example, when we first see the germans in privka, they're not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent (not that they aren't out to take whatever they can). they have their own national pride going too, that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their christian-led masters tell them to. at the least, the evil of the picture has a face, however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in. there's also a brief scene, before the ice-scape battle, where the russian troupe has a joke that's being told and laughed about, and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little. because more often than not in alexander nevsky, with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare, there aren't any complexities to characters, most notably nevsky himself (played in ultra-heroic fashion, only questioning near the start, by nikolai cherkasov) who perhaps has to be this way in eistenstein's intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale. after all, to be looking for naturalism in an eisenstein film is like trying to find non-kosher pig's feet at a deli.<br /><br />but the real reason to see the picture isn't the acting, anyhow, but for the look of the film, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that eisenstein lays out. on the epic scale it's just as ambitious as his 20's films, with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities, of the hundreds of people rolling on through. in fact, i'd say that any director working in hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic, particularly war, would do very well to take a look at this film, even with just the sound off. it's even better if thought of as a silent film, with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times. one could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice, how it starts with the german soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs, and then how eisenstein inter-cuts between close-ups of the actors fighting and then to wide-shots and with sped-up editing. and, of course, one can't discount the power of the music as well, sergei prokofiev delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work. all the while the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed. if this was just a short film, it would surely rank with the greats, much like the odessa stairs sequence.<br /><br />if i did find it a little less than totally magnificent, it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound. while i have yet to see ivan the terrible, my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors, which is really as broad as can be, with the melodrama at such a high-pitch its staggering (the sub-plot of the two soldiers vying for the olga is the best example i can think of). but even this considered, alexander nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore, and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film-making to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to. grade: a
