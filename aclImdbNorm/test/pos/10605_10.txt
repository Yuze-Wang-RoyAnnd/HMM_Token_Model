the movie haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time. it features the cast from cky (the movies) and also has a great soundtrack. if you have seen any cky or viva la bam you will notice that everybody (from those two) are in it. including bam's parents and many other people.<br /><br />the story is about ryan dunn's girlfriend glauren (jennifer rivall) cheating on him, and him trying to get back at her. he does this by having valo (bam) and falcone (dicamillo) vandalize her house. there are many different characters with many different stories.<br /><br />there is great music on the soundtrack. bands such as him & her, cky, gnar kill, daniel lioneye. iggy and the stooges pop, and new order. <br /><br />if you do not like viva la bam or cky (the movies) i doubt you will like this. if you do like that stuff...this movie is great.
