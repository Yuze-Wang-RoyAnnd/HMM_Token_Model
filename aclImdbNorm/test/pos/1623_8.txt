so first things first..<br /><br />angels and demons is a much better and very different film than the da- vinci code.<br /><br />following the recent slew of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive gci and over the top action sequences.<br /><br />in this respect angels and demons almost feels old fashioned.it offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion vs science, offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of god in rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science that is cern's large hadron collider facility.<br /><br />hanks is hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in da-vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being armin mueller-stahl's stoic cardinal. but the films main saving grace is it's pace. for the entire running time i was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic.<br /><br />my only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity. but that is not the fault of the film makers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story..<br /><br />speaking of which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way.<br /><br />overall i would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general.
