this film is well cast, often silly and always funny. lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director. from the first "hare krishna" to the last "you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs", i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy
