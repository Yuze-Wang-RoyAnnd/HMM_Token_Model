i love this movie, first and foremost because of mark wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. there is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. jen aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. it takes a look at the rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). it takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through. like a diamond, this movie shines. you won't waste your popcorn on this one. semi-chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. there's some laughs thrown in too.
