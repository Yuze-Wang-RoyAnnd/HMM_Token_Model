chan is in new york and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design.<br /><br />the war was over a year away from reaching america but the second world war was already raging everywhere else in the world and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that war was coming. here the war isn't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least alludes to it. the mystery itself is pretty good, it the notion of plane sabotage lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments. to be certain we are talking about charlie chan so we can be certain that he would live to fight another day, but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in, not whether anyone around him would survive.<br /><br />i really like this film a great deal. its not one of the nest, and far from the worst. it is one of the truly rare things, a truly enjoyable one. definitely worth a look or six.
