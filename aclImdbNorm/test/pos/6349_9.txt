a rich experience is to be gained from watching this film.<br /><br />this is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil, yiu kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical chinese poetry. he is married with two sons, and things at home seem normal. he still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons alternately fill him with pride (the elder one) and disappointment (the younger one).<br /><br />his passion for the poetry makes him an object of infatuation for a senior student in one of his classes. the student, choi lam, draws pictures of him during class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming from his mouth. she teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality, although that too is an element. he of course is not immune to her attention, though he tries for a while to keep the demarcation line between teacher and student in place.<br /><br />the reason why he doesn't succeed in the end is complicated. firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and choi lam. it becomes clear that she genuinely likes him, and it's mutual. secondly, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill. the consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad to bear.<br /><br />nothing is treated trivially in this film. all the characters have a vivid internal life, and an easily discernible history. the two leads, jacky cheung and anita mui, are outstanding, as are karena lam as the student choi lam, and shaun tam as the elder son on yin.<br /><br />recommended without reservation.
