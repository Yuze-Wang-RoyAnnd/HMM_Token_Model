'o brother, where art thou' is a gleeful retelling of homer's 'odyssey', set in 1930s mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers coen. three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. george clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to john turturro and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'soggy bottom boys' by clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. the three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. and there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the kkk rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'the wizard of oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. and what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! without giving away the ending, i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'magnolia', another one of my favorites). 'o brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!
