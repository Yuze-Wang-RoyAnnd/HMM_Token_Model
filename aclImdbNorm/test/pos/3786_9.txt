this is one of chaplin's first national films from the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature united artists features. more opulent than the mutual films, it continues chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. most people forget that the film is actually a dream that charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.<br /><br />there is plenty of slapstick via the limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.<br /><br />by this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves. doubtless this was not the case, but still, it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as i can remember, albeit from an ironically humorous perspective.<br /><br />as far as i am concerned, familiarity with the entirety of chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles - do not delay!
