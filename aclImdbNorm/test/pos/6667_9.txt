i thoroughly enjoyed this film. i had read the book a good ten years ago and was intrigued about how it would translate to film.<br /><br />the screenplay is very true to the book, which i was charmed by - this is a rarity in itself these days. the characterisations were solid and believeable, and the stroytelling kept me shifting in my perceptions, even though i already knew the ending from the book.<br /><br />an intelligent and well crafted film.
