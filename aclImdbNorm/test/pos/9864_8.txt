im a huge m lillard fan that's why i ended up watching this movie. honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent. a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming. it's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7/10.<br /><br />the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie.<br /><br />its a good rental!<br /><br />7/10
