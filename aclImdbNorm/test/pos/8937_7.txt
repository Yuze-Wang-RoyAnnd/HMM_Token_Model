"plots with a view" of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the british could do it. the film's sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick-ish. it's the only film by director nick hurran i've seen so far, and while i am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment (i'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this one is highly enjoyable and very funny. the film takes place in a little town in wales, where betty rhys-jones (brenda blethyn) is married to the town's drunken and adulterous major (robert pugh). the local mortician boris (alfred molina) has been desperately in love with betty since their childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love to her. apart from being desperately in love, boris has some other problems, as the eccentric american mortician frank featherbed (christopher walken) has opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town... the film's odd, very british wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre. also, "plots with a view" profits from a wonderful cast. brenda bethlyn, who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000's "saving grace", plays the lead, and she is once again very funny, and very lovable in her role. alfred molina, who plays her shy admirer, delivers a great performance as always, and robert pugh fits perfectly in the role of betty's sleazy husband. beautiful naomi watts is also great as the husband's 'secretary', i'm becoming a bigger fan with every film i see her in. the greatest role, however, is played by the incomparable christopher walken (one of my favorite actors). walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox. overall, "plots with a view" is a vastly entertaining little british comedy that i highly recommend!
