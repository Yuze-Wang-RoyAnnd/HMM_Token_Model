i watched princess of the nile for the first time when i was about 10 years old. i am 63 now and have never forgotten the movie. nor have i gotten over my fascination with egypt. i have searched the internet trying to buy the movie, but have not been able to locate it. it makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in hollywood. i loved debra padget and jeffrey hunter together. they have such charisma together. if you were to ask me anything about the movie i could not tell you anything other than who was in it. i vaguely remember a scene by the nile with debra padget a bunch of other women.i have always wanted to see it again. i never thought of it as an escape movie back then, but i can see now where that was probably the case. i do hope they will put it on dvd and i will be able to see it again before i die. it was a wonderful movie.
