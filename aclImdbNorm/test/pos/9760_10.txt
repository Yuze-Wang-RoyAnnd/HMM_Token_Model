i can't count the times i have watched this, and although it differs from the book in story line the mood is still the same. the bond that two such diverse people give each other that surpasses trials and years is immortal. and that the element of the women prisoners was an actual event, that did happen to real people. the story is about the strength of character of ordinary people, people who just tried to survive a horrible time in their lives. and this also presented australia in a real mode. the country is like all countries, areas that everyone loves, quaint country areas and desolate areas. but it gives shute a stage for jean's transformation from a lowly outback town to a family community.
