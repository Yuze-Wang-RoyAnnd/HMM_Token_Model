this is a family comedy -- in the very best senses of the term. uncomplicatedly about faith and family, ann blyth, with the help of everybody's favorite grandpa, edmund gwenn, gets divine help in lifting the o'moyne's above the would-be vengeance schemes of goldtooth mccarthy (john mcintire). pure fun.
