in 1989, aardman animations introduced the two heros in the grand day out. in 1993, they fought an evil penguin in the wrong trousers. and in 1995, they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close shave. in 2005, they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and cuddlely in the curse of the were-rabbit. in this full feature film, wallace and gromit work in anit-pesto, a pest-control business. there's going to be a giant vegetable competition, but rabbits keep eating the neighbors vegies. wallace and gromit takes care with that problem. but wallace had an idea. he will brainwash the bunnies with his machine. after doing that, something suddenly eats all of the vegies in the neighborhood and it's big. it's up to wallace and gromit to save the day. as a fan of these two characters, i was impressed. it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice-overs, they put a no name cast to the job and boy, they did a fantastic job. wallace and gromit has not changed. wallace is still the cheese-loving freak like he always was and gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. also, the script was not too shabby like other family movies were. there is a twist of who the were-rabbit really is. the direction from nick park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a really good job with the storyline. instead of adding the hollywood formula in it, he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it. well done, nick. the rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him. the characters were not bad and they weren't annoying, but they'll never top wallace and gromit. the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. i've never seen a clay-animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run. overall, fans of the two knuckleheads (including the teens) will love this fantastic film. it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year. hooray, wallace and gromit. 10/10
