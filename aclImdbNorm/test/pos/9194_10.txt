like in "les amants du pont-neuf" two outsiders lives a love story without concessions. the film consists out of a lot of interesting conversation and a lot of sweet moments. the best one comes in a listening booth. they listen to a record together and once in a while they look at each other. they talk, they like each other. she suggests a change in their lives but he is out of hope. the realistic stylestrokes over the realistic (but) emotive dialogs. a really mathematic screenwriter's work for this film. spanish novel director jesus ponce creates one of the most perfect gallery from the latest year of spanish cinema.
