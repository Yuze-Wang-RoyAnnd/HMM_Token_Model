in my opinion the directing, editing, lighting, and acting(minus franco) were very good. i must admit, i was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film. i wasn't expecting much, in way of camera angles, sound, etc, but in these areas the film wasn't bad at all.<br /><br />after seeing the film, i personally felt frustrated with both characters because i wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another. and i felt like the travis(franco) character wasn't really affected or changed in the end after terri commits suicide. although, this is probably due to the lack or inability of james franco to express emotion(of any kind) very well in this movie. i've seen a few of franco's other films, and to me he just can't pull it off when a scene calls for real emotion or facial expressions. the only positive he brings to the film, is the possibility of more people watching this movie.<br /><br />on the other hand, rachel miner's portrayal of terri was well done, and she looks to have a bright future ahead. i could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character, and it made me feel for her. i only wish i could have seen more into terri's life before the film ended.<br /><br />for a short film, this movie was good, but it leaves you wanting more in the end. i only wish it could have been just a bit longer, to see the characters develop a little more. in spite of that, i hope to see more films from the director and crew in the future.:)
