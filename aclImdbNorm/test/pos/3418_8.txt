...and normally i don't like surprises!! watch this movie by chance in a motel in south africa second week of a three month motorbiking holiday in za. apart from being well shot and acted it helped me in understanding the countries problems tremendously. just watched the " million dollar baby" and had to look up hillary swank since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was superb. didn't realise she was the solicitor in the "red dust". well now i'm not to worried that she will disappear as so many other sidekicks of clint before... now i am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for i have written what i wanted to write. ok, here it goes: i think if you are from a western country, especially europe, watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there! so this hopefully will fill ten lines.
