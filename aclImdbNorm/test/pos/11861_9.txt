okay, maybe this movie not a revolution. but it a very good piece of entertainment, and it's liv tyler's variation of alicia silverstone's "clueless" or cameron diaz' "there's something about mary".<br /><br />liv plays a femme fatale, which just wants to have an own house and all kinds of material comfort in it. and well she does everything to get just that... even crimes. many crimes. and she drops every boyfriend which doesn't cooperate to get these things. additionally, she actually doesn't mind to have some additional lovers beside her current boyfriend.<br /><br />this movie is even funnier to watch if one knows that liv is actually of zodiac sign cancer - and cancer are reported to be very domestic. so the character liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer !<br /><br />i was alone in cinema when i watched this one. that was quite comfortable because i could laugh as loud as i wished all the time - but it also felt strange, as if nobody was actually interested in this movie ?<br /><br />i myself liked it very much. the acting was between very good to excellent, especially the main actors where brilliant. there where enough jokes, many of the black kind, and good dialogues.<br /><br />this is a trash movie, and it is full of black humor. if you like this kind of movies, try this one !
