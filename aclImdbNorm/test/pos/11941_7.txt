peter coyote was the only name that i recognised from the cast list, so i wasn't too keen on watching this film. the only comment on imdb was positive, so i watched it on late night t.v. i would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing. it's better than a lot of this genre. the plot is excellent, the acting isn't brilliant, but it's not bad. i don't usually like flashbacks but in this film they work. as i've stated, i didn't recognise any of the cast by name, but i recognised michele lee, who gave a decent, hard working performance, as the woman wanting to stand by her man, who is lying to her. (was it knots landing?) anyhow, she's wearing really well. note: you may enjoy it more, if you miss the first few seconds of the credits. i did and it helped me. when you see the end credits, you'll get what i mean the wayne kennedy character, who is really weird, takes this to a 7 rather than a 6.
