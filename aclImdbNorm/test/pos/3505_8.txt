ali g indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films i've seen in a long time, and cohen's portrayal of a british gangsta is hilarious. this film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. ali g indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. definitely vote ali g and keep it real.
