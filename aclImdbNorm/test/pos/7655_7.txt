latcho drom, or safe journey, is the second film in tony gatlif's trilogy of the romany people. the film is a visual depiction and historical record of romany life in european and middle eastern countries. even though the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed, and staged there is not a conventional story line and the dialog does not explain activities from scene to scene. instead, the film allows the viewer to have sometimes a glimpse, sometimes a more in-depth view of these people during different eras and in different countries, ranging from india, egypt, romania, hungary, slovakia, france, and spain.<br /><br />the importance of music in romany culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. it is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication. everything they do is expressed with music. dance is another important activity. like romany music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something they alone know how to do correctly. we are provided glimpses into their everyday activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. rather, it is a testament to their culture, focusing on the music and dance they have created and which have made them unique.<br /><br />mr. gatlif portrays the nomadic groups in a positive way. however, we also witness the rejection, distrust, and alienation they receive from the non-romany population. it seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations, and inspired from diverse countries, will fade into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic ways.<br /><br />the other films in the trilogy are les princes (1983) and gadjo dilo (1998).
