this is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships: playboys (max), manipulative women (alice) and the fools who may be indeed in love (lisa, muriel and lucien).<br /><br />max and alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark. but as the profusely discussed ending tells us, as veteran players as max and alice were, they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself. lisa, muriel and lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship, only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers (as far as what we were shown is concerned....who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen).<br /><br />this is a very fast-paced, delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast. it also deserves some deeper thinking: how much is real in a game of relationship?
