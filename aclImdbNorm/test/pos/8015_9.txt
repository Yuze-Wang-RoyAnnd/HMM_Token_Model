these were two video shot movies that troama decided were horrible so in a desperate move turned into this one movie. perhaps the bitterness on troama's side helped spark the comedy, but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with "oliver stone" doing commentary during the movie. lots of cameos, lots of use of the lesbian cannibal hoedown song add to the fun. trey parker, ted raimi, julie strain etc etc....<br /><br />one of the best of recent troama releases. yes it's all over the place, know that going in, the production quality, or lack of, becomes one of the many running jokes. go with it and you'll be in for a good time.<br /><br />the behind the scenes, frequently the best things about troama releases are also above average this time around. i really think the anger they felt over these two lousy films helped drive them to, well not greatness, but drove them to "fix" this film in a way that's better than either of the films would have been as they were originally planned.
