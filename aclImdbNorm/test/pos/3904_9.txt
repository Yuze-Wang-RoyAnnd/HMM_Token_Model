i first saw the victim (aka out of contention) well over 25 years ago when i was very young. being a passionate fan of bewitched since i was a child, i loved to watch anything that starred elizabeth montgomery. this movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of miss montgomery's work or not. elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in a case of rape and as the suspected murderess in the legend of lizzie borden. her performance in the victim as kate, a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a killer after her is brilliant. if you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end. another great performance well worth mentioning is that of eileen heckhart who plays the eerie and suspicious housekeeper. unfortunately like most of miss montgomery's movies, the victim is not available on dvd and i believe that although it was released on vhs some years ago, it is a rarity these days. i was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie. a must see!
