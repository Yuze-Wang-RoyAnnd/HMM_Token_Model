hadnt heard a lot about this movie, except it being national award and oscar entry. its a marathi movie, n i cant make out apple from orange in marathi. but when i saw the movie playing on dd1 late sunday night, i just got glued. now i am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills. but i have watched a good number of movies, of various genres, and for an average viewer, i will highly recommend this movie. the feel is very earthy and realistic, though there are some melodramatic moments. watch it to feel human. lately haven't seen any movie, which touches heart, especially in hindi cinema. the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home. the camera moves around to reveal the kid, wearing black glasses, having lost his eyes, the kid hears the other kids splashing in the water and starts clapping. i was awestruck. and the two hours i spent watching the movie - very much worth it :-)
