do not expect a classic military comedy, which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook. instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. kind of east german version of "buffalo soldiers".<br /><br />"nva" works on a meta-level that it sympathizes with its heroes' attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can. it's not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles. utopian, of course (in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality), but very thoughtful.<br /><br />just to fill the required 10 lines: do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job.
