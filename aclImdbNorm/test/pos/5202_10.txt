a movie like this doesn't come along too often. i'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. politicians and civilian hawks should view this before making decisions on how the destroy peoples lives, i watched this the day after viewing the tv version of "uprising" about the warsaw ghetto. even with this fresh in mind i felt sympathy for the german soldier. i felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen. it will take awhile to thaw out from this one. i'm surprised they have not made a movie based on "the forgotten soldier" by buy sajer. this movie shares the cold with the book. both will haunt me for the rest of my life.
