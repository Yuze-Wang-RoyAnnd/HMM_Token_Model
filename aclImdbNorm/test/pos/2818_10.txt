i love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was rose. rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? does our society teach this? can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? to what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? how is a "typical" human alike or different than rose? lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like france or italy? i loved that this movie provoked all of these questions in me, while it entertained, stimulated, and kept me guessing to the end! every time i've watched it, i have learned more about the film and myself.
