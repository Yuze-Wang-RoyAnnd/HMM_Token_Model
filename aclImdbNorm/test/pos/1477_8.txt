from the start you will like sam elliott's character (falon) : a trustworthy cop that is notably loyal to his partner. but too loyal, and too revengeful when seeing his partner dead in an alley, cause he then kills who he thought to be the assailant before giving him a chance to explain. falon is an alcoholic, and that tends to sway him from being in self control, though he manages to direct his attention towards finding who's really behind his partners death. he carries along a rookie as his new partner (which seems to be seen too often in films) but esai morales does well in accompanying sam elliot, though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where morales begins a self-approved investigation towards falon; he mainly wants to find the answers since fallon isn't letting him in on the whole story, and does not like what he finds. there is not a last minute showing at who the bad detectives are, which is okay; and they are not able to sway falon into joining them, leading to a dramatic ending. fine acting all the way around, with a touch of humor from paul sorvino who is the captain of detectives. it's a good movie that will make you want to see it several times; so it qualifies as a -must see-, and a good addition to a movie collection!
