alice (florinda bolkan), a translator living in italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and can't recall the last couple of days. she starts to follow a trace of memory fragments, which leads her to the small town of garma. people in the town seem to recognize her and she's beginning to suspect that the re-occurring nightmares of astronauts conducting horrible experiments has something to do with her own amnesia.<br /><br />the movie is interesting and the plot is good, but it's a bit to slow moving and arty for my taste. the plot takes some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's heading. florinda bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "flavia the heretic") and it's always nice to see "star" child actor nocoletta elmi. klaus kinski's role is too small though. this is not a movie for the die-hard gore hound or exploitation addict, but still a very nice hour-and-a-half mystery.
