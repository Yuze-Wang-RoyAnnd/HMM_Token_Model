/*may contain spoilers, but of course it does not matter :) */<br /><br />battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images. the visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the sheer scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly pioneering. what is really amazing is, to my mind, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, the faux-profound (self-)referentialism of today, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. what you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered.<br /><br />btw, the previous poster noted: "eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you. it's a little cheap. i would've rather seen a huge final action scene."<br /><br />i must warn you, that the end is not cheap, and eisenstein wasn't being generous to the heroes. history, however, was. potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film.<br /><br />finally, i'd strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. see it with a fellow movie buff, it kept me talking for hours. however, if you tend to consider films, generally accepted as "great" or "classic", to be "slow" or "boring", this film might not be for you yet. not much cheap entertainment here.<br /><br />for me though, it is a full 10/10.
