i watched this short moments ago on the sundance film festival website, and i must say it is absolutely astounding. i expected it to be entertaining - like all of the sundance shorts - but i wasn't prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty. <br /><br />if you haven't yet seen any of this years entries to the festival, i suggest you go onto the site and watch these mini-masterpieces - i have seen them all, and can honestly say 'the youth in us' is the one that has touched my heart the most. i'm not the weakest audience member when it comes to romance in films, but my eyes flooded up so much i'm surprised i could still see the screen.<br /><br />i agree with 'addicted2you', it truly is a masterful piece of directorial work, and the cinematography will just take your breath away. <br /><br />i can't think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes.
