three american lads are backpacking their way around europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can, but andy seeks true love. he finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the eiffel tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful julie delpy. his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride. i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the 'london' original, although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel.
