...instead, watch it as a great coming of age tale about african american males in the mid 1960's in the ghettos of chicago. for all of you out there under the age of 50, "what's happening" was a light-hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) concerning a group of young african american high school kids living in a working class neighborhood. i liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. "cooley high" started out as being the basis for "what's happening", but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences, so it was redone as a comedy, even though the credits on "what's happening" still read that it was based on this movie.<br /><br />this film starts out light, but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960's and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. the guys deal with sex, betrayal, joblessness, hopelessness, and even early death. the ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a great motown soundtrack. highly recommended. unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either.
