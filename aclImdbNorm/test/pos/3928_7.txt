i do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. it's one of the best "teenager" horror films i've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (a clear example is the mindless "saint ange".) the first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. after the arrival to the village, though, the horror -a different, twisted kind of horror- begins.<br /><br />with the plot and the details, goofs are minor; the characters are this movie's strongest point, given that so many clich'es are broken in it. for example, the two main male characters, nick and wade, are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to; although dalton might fit better in this stereotype, not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. some scenes are truly, satisfyingly horrible, making up for tense moments scattered around all the film. and, in the end, and although everything is decorously explained, it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters.<br /><br />the only errors i can see, and which do not imply continuity (ie, carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious bo's pockets) is the illumination, which is somehow annoying during the first, boring 30 minutes. although, plot and effects-wise, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to ambrosia, that little village in the midst of nothing, so i'll give it that. it's been pretty much argued that about 70% of the movie is illogical; "how can two people build an entire house of wax?", "where do they get all the wax from?". these wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie. the sinclair brothers did not build the house of wax; their mother worked making actual wax figures, and they were exhibited at the museum. and the scenario where paris hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question; what is with all the personal objects (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of the dead people? using their third brother as a connection with the exterior, it's pretty much arguable that the sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax, in a wwii-type fashion.<br /><br />so, that aside, i think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets, and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. so go see the house of wax. right now.
