the curse of monkey island has always been my favorite of the series. a vibrant visual look, an excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice-cast all create a memorable and humouristic adventure.<br /><br />graphics wise the game is definitely not a let-down. though some corners have been cut the over-all feel of the game is reminiscent of disney feature length animations. the gameplay is simple and even a novice will get the hang of it soon enough. the game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its mega monkey mode.<br /><br />the voice-cast is one of my favorites. dominic armato's sympathetic voice makes guybrush complete and alexandra boyd is simply charming as elaine. earl boen makes for a wonderfully sinister yet over-the-top villain, lechuck. also the game's charm is added by memorable characters like wally (neil ross), murray (denny delk) and one of my personal favorites haggis mcmutton (allan young, voice of scrooge mcduck). my hat also goes off to the late, great kay kuter and his memorable secondary-role as griswold goodsoup.<br /><br />michael land's tropical and wonderful soundtrack once more graces the monkey island adventure, comprising of some of the best tunes in the business. the game isn't perfect and some locales are not as well detailed as other, but i had no gripes with the simple ending of the game which i found very satisfying.
