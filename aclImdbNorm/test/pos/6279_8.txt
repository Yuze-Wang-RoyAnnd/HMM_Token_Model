this is like something i have never seen before. it had me cracking up the whole time i don't think there was one scene that i didn't laugh through. it is about a girl from the country in south who goes off to a big town for college. at the school she befriends the ra across the hall. when she realizes that he has no family to go to for thanksgiving she invites him to come home with her. rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do...propose. she urges cral to do something so he stands up and shouts something like... sorry mate but you are too late i already asked becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes. that all turns into chaos. please watch this classic it is totally worth it... i swear.
