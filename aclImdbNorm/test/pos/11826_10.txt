and i do not understand why the show gets so much beating. in my opinion this show really is excellent. well the first two episodes were not that great but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode. which seems to be typical for a steve moffat sitcom. i would rate it among the best sitcoms britain has ever produced.<br /><br />the show itself is a farce at its best, it is not along the lines of fawlty towers, but you definitely can rank it as high as a black adder, coupling, or the young ones! i am watching the first season, and all i can say is that i am happy i bought the dvd!<br /><br />the problem probably with this show is and why it got smacked so hard, according to the internet, that the original press release compared it to fawlty towers, and everyone was disappointed it was not! well even green wing is closer to fawlty towers than this show, all i can say is clear your mind from every prejudice, give the show at least a run until (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself!<br /><br />all i can say is thanks steve moffat for writing it and thanks for the entire staff pulling it off!
