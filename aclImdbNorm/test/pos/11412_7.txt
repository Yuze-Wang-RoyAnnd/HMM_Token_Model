when a stranger calls is actually a pretty good movie. i had never saw the original and so when i watched this i thought it was unique. when when a stranger calls was advertised on the television the trailer gave away the ending. well, i never saw the trailer so when i saw this film i was surprised at how good it turned out to be. i walked by it one day and decided i'd buy it and now i'm lucky i did, because i thought it was a very pleasing movie that is a nice little film to own. it is getting a lot of unfair treatment, and if you're interested in this movie at all, don't listen to all the negativity. camille belle is not as bad of an actress as everyone makes her out to be, and she did a great job in this movie, so all you haters get over yourselves, lighten up, and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is; a fun, teeny bopper, popcorn flick. if you haven't seen it please do for it is a lot more enjoyable than a lot of the other slashers being made recently...
