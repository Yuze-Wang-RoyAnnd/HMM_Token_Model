this film is my favorite comedy of all time and i have seen a lot of comedies.first of all,i should not this film had no script.just a storyboard.the dialogue is almost completely written by the actors.which makes this film absolutely hsyterical.the cast is one of the best comedic ensemble's you will ever see.the story is about the mayflower dog show in philadelphia and some of the contestants in them.parker posey shines and is absolutely great!this is one of those films that most of the laughing comes from the absolute pathetic-ness of the characters.*****/*****
