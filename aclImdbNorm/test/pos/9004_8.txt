like most sports movies which have come out in the past, this movie is similar in respects, that it is based on fact. what sets this movie apart is that its about a rugby team, a sport that not too many americans are familiar with. set that aside, this movie is very rewarding piece of film noir. it reminds me of "we are marshall" , but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel. its a fine effort by director ryan little to bring us a story about a rebellious teen played by sean farris (never back down), as rick penning that finds himself in an odd place, both on and off the field. despite a few plot lines holes, this film has heart, rewarding each of its viewers with good characters that we can identify with. also good performances by supporting actors gary cole as coach larry gelwix & neal mcdonough as coach penning(ricks dad). i felt myself go through a lot of different emotions watching movie, in the end i was left with a feeling of faith in mankind & a hope for the future for my children, especially if there are coaches out there like gelwix.
