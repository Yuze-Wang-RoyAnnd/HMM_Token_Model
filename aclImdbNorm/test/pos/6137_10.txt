i agree with so many of the other reviewers here. this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish. unfortunately, i believe the author died before he could see this film made. the performances are all top rate, with the three principles (john glover, ben cross, and veronica hamel) seemingly made for their roles. the exteriors, both in europe and israel, seem very authentic, and the 4-hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story. fortunately, i did tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since. i can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day. i gave it a rating of 10. if you haven't read the book, you should really find a copy. this would be an outstanding film to release on dvd with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast.
