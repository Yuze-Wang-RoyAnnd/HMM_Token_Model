the plot starts out interesting, however, towards the end too many die in too short a time, turning the thriller-mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter.<br /><br />the only true highlights were adam beach and j"urgen prochnow, who were once again their excellent selves. nice try with an inappropriate last third, though a good ending.
