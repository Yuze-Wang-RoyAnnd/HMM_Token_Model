citizen kane....the godfather part ii....d'urville martin's dolemite. this is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity. rudy ray moore, in a role that transcends academy awards stars as dolemite, the baddest cat in the universe. he clearly does not take any jive from no turkey (i myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of rapping, pimping, and karate chopping. this is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive. the true godfather of rap (not this new ali nonsense) moore is something of a juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow managing to be the most charismatic awful actor of the 1970's, and thats saying something. this one is highly recommended folks, if not for the one-liners alone.
