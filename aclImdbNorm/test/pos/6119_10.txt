the film that gave us john waters is one of the funniest films ever. yes it may be gross but it's filled with hysterical moments that nobody has done since. the infamous dog-scene has to be one of the highlights of cinema. not a film for the easily offended it's one of those movies where you always see something new. divine's performance is worth the reputation. mink stole is hysterical. this is the film responsible for the farrely brothers and the entire gross-out comedy genre. i know that sounds a bit extreme but think about it. before this comedies were very run of the mill and almost identical. after this movie comedies became strange and weird, but in a good way. i'd give it 15 out of 10 if i could.
