crossing the bridge: the sound of istanbul received one of the most rapturous applause from the audience when it ended and very deservingly so. i did not expect too much from a musical documentary but the movie proved to be much more than that. it was also a visual documentary of istanbul with stark contrasts of old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. black and white photographs of old istanbul by world famous armenian photographer ara guler were exceptional. but of course main theme was music, and by god, what a variety of it! it was in a way similar to bueno vistas social club; the love and the respect of the interviewer -alexander hacke here replacing ray cooder- for the musicians exuded from the screen and engulfed us all. the music was mostly very interesting. the jazz session by a group of romany gypsies in a small western turkish town was mind blowing. i will not be surprised if the travel agents start getting group booking requests for kesan after the movie is released. but i most loved muzeyyen senar who looked amazingly elegant in a sort of burlesque way and whilst tipping her "raki" declared courageously: "my voice and i are 86 years old!" well done faith akin. i bet there are many more turkish musicians who are feeling left out: go for volume ii please.
