a wounded tonto standing alone to protect three innocent lives. a devious woman masterminding a deadly plot. racial tension. smart indians.<br /><br />these are things we rarely if ever saw in the tv series, but this movie adds them all into the mix. while this is most certainly a lone ranger movie, it mixes up the formula just enough that those who grew tired of the series would probably still enjoy it. definitely recommended for any fan.
