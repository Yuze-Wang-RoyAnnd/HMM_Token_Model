david suchet is agatha christie's mustached detective hercule poirot in "after the funeral," produced in 2005. anyone who has heard david suchet speak with his own british accent knows what a shock it is, because his accent as poirot is so perfect and organic to the character. suchet is the poirot of agatha christie's books, and although i confess a love for peter ustinov in the role, his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what christie wrote.<br /><br />in this episode, poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. enroute on the train, the solicitor recounts the events after the death - a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered. when poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, lots of secrets, another will and murder.<br /><br />the story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful, detailed depiction of the time period. all of the acting is superb, particularly from monica dolan, who plays miss gilchrist. poirot here is without hastings, his beautiful office, or miss lemon but he's effective nonetheless.<br /><br />i had the privilege of seeing david suchet on broadway in "amadeus." breathtaking. what an actor - when he's playing poirot, all i see is poirot.
