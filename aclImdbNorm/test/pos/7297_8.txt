i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. what's the problem here? folks admit that the performances are great--i mean, lange is stellar!--and that the film is good-looking, but it's got less than a '6'! i don't get it. come on! the writing's not that bad!<br /><br />having read a lot of pulitzer-winning novels, and having seen a lot of the films based on them, i think a better-than-decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together. i thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly. this story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it, and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used.<br /><br />**book spoiler part** i was, however, a little disappointed in the ginny-tries-to-kill-rose subplot's being omitted. i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it out. avid movie-goers, more than avid readers, i think, tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff. it's apt to confuse johnny lunchpail and joe sixpack.<br /><br />if you loved the book, you will like the movie. if you hated the book, you will likely hate the movie.<br /><br />********<br /><br />rog
