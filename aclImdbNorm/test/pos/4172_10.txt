symbolism galore, great tunes, this film crushed their "soon to be no more" target audience's expectations. these monkees and the naturally selected members of the group, were witnessing a subtle yet in your face, kiss goodbye to each other. the message rings true today, the cage you escape from and the bridge you want to jump off of, are the next generations own disappointments, there will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains. the film can be frustrating at times, because the themes the film attacks are so blatantly apart of the american way of life, a thinking and reasoning person cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of head, and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday american life, but the motives of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness. the final scene, similar to don quixote's chivalric daring of the caged tiger to exit for battle, represents just how delusional and impossible most dreams are.
