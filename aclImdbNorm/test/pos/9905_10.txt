it was a rare treat to see "checking out". i was touched by the characters, laughed a lot at the wonderful script, and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions magnificently portrayed by this ensemble cast and especially by peter falk. in fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level of the best academy award-winning performances. he is a consummate actor who out-did himself in this film. the screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that had me laughing out loud in the theater. i highly recommend "checking out" to everyone wanting to enjoy quality storytelling superbly acted.
