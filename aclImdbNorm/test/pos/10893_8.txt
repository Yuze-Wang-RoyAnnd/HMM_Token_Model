this is one of my favorite james bond in games because: the missions are fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be hard that makes them fun to do the weapons you use are good. the way james bond look in this james bond games is pretty you can see pierce brosnan in him which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors that played them in the movie. there is no way that you can't have a good time playing this game i loved it.also the game follows the movie pretty much maybe a few added thing but it pretty much follows the movie. also the this james bond game has pretty good graphics for nintendo 64 and to bad there was no voice over actors in this game but who care as long as the game is fun to play.<br /><br />overall score ******** out of **********
