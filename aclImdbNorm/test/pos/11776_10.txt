<br /><br />fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace, and far more entertaining, if you ask me. hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days. i hate to describe it too much-it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing. suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them. household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots, the princess anne-droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair, and fluke starbucker is even more of a dork than his original, if that's possible. ernie fosselius is one crazy son-of-a-buck-he's also the source of porklips now, the apocalypse now spoof.
