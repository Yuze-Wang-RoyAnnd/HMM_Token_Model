having seen the uncut version, i thought this film was beautifully made. it captured my attention from beginning to end; the tension was wonderfully conveyed. nasaan ka man portrays the typical filipino family with accuracy in its presentation of secrets and lies. even the religious culture, the human tendency to keep up appearances and maintain a pure reputation is shown with stark vividness in gloria diaz's character. there is not a little scene in this film that does not have a purpose- the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliant.<br /><br />although the plot is great, i personally found that the twist at the end, the revelation to do with jericho's character was not as much of a shock as it should be. but then maybe that's just me, because otherwise, nasaan ka man is a very cleverly made film.<br /><br />the casting was good to begin with, but deither and claudine's acting were the icing on the cake. not one to miss if you're looking for a filipino film that will surprise and surpass expectations. thumbs up to the director.
