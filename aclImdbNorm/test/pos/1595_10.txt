if all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, death in venice would have to be it. it is a monument in movie history. much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'morte a venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />life was slow then, compared to now. people were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. director visconti and dirk bogarde, the leading actor, admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer von aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. for a man like von aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. we see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music, composed by gustav mahler.<br /><br />this movie is slow, there is no denying it. no special effects, car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats. no perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.<br /><br />so, basically, nothing much happens in this movie? not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum. if you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto, this is the movie to do it.
