superb and charming. justin henry is beautiful as a blissed out and mischievous howard kaylan, lead singer for the top ten hit making band, the turtles. the real magic is the titular sequence with an academy award worthy turn by royale watkins. a performance that completely captures the mystical and yet down to earth jimi hendrix. not many films, unbelievably so, can find the essence of a special moment in a life and times. i'd like to see this available at any home video retail outlet without any hassle. uh..what's the deal?<br /><br />thanks eddie. a worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. a definite twinkle in the mind's eye.
