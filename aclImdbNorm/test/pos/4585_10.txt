i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film. the acting was fine, there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling. it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children, or choose to have none at all...whereas dumb ass "w in '04" supporters are procreating like rabbits. and, though i don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years, i can see mike judge's parodied prophet coming to be, as life imitating art. the world is being run by idiots, and it will get worse as the intelligent free-thinking people become the minority and the "git 'er done" fans outnumber them. the proof is our farce of an election.<br /><br />but i digress. if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city, go see it. i have paid my $7.50 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this (date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone?). there are laughs, there are cringes, but overall this is entertaining. if you have half a brain, you will think to yourself how this movie, though funny, is spot on (accurate) and a *tiny* bit uncanny. i'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown, as fox was the one distributing this, and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see this and think "maybe i will read a book, and not watch 'next', or 'cheaters', or 'ow my balls'." if our society doesn't stop the dumbing down of everything,and the bastardisation of the english language (ahem, mr. bush), then this really is where we are going.
