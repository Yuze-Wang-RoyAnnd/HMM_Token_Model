in "checking out", peter falk plays an elderly new yorker who summons his children home so that they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide. as the movie progresses, we get to see everyone's flaws and other problems. while some people may interpret this as a "heartwarming" movie, i mostly enjoyed it for peter falk's character not letting anything get him down, and even engaging in a little lewdness now and then.<br /><br />so, it might not be the best movie ever, but still worth seeing. i've long thought that peter falk has the perfect look to play this sort of role, what with his glass eye and all. also starring laura san giacomo, david paymer, judge reinhold and shera danese (falk's real-life wife).
