this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years. if there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. a $4 mil box is a disgrace. people don't know what it's about. if you have any appreciation for the blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. how many people knew jackson could sing, and damn fine too. you hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. after seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. yes, it's gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. isn't that the best reason to see a movie? those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week.
