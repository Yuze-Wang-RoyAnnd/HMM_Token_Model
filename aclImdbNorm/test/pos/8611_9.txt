smashing film about film-making. shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors & their actors; the manipulation and mind games; the preening egotism of performers. as in any workplace, sexuality complicates matters, but here to the nth degree as they are filming a sex scene.<br /><br />absolutely fantastic performances from gregoire colin as the fragile, wannabe macho male lead, and - supremely - anne parillaud as the director's self-portrait. the image of her laughing & eating a banana at the end, having finally got what she wants out of her puppets, is pure delight.
