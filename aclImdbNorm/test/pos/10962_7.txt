what is there to say about an anti-establishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void, social indifference and authoritarian contentment. cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves. i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such 'beat' filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late 1950's known as the french new wave.<br /><br />they discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy; even at this stage this peculiar, highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth century.<br /><br />cassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we, as a culture, are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice. the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect; a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations, not so much imagery. this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretation.<br /><br />although my favourite cassevettes film is 'husbands', this one is his most important.
