no music. no stupid masala. a reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in india and based on a real "encounter" specialist in india, daya nayak. that is ab tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead "sadhu agashe" has killed" - well you already know that bit)brilliance exudes nan patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating indian cop. the one liners are just hilarious. the plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. another one of the films from ram gopal vermas the factory. movies which are either decent or really good, ab tak chappan meanders close to very good. but yet remains one of the top 70 films released from india, commercial and artsy included.<br /><br />what is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally (in an indian flick) how the police network works. the cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell (though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny) the producers are trying for a cannes release, which is interesting. made by debut director shamit aman (i think thats his name).<br /><br />again 55 y.o. nana patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. really good stuff. if you are interested in indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief.<br /><br />again patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie- relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. good dialoges, good acting, nice direction all in all great stuff. recommendations: gangaajal, ram gopal verma's company (both indian flicks)
