once again, we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists' work has been fully restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling. inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise, from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy, etc.<br /><br />in essence, this is a story of those goods "coming to life," such as the animals on the labels of items, or a pie, or even a pack of cigarettes.<br /><br />the whole "show" is narrated by "jack bunny," a jack benny impersonator, with music from conductor leopold stokowski, who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count. a lot of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who "little egypt" and other characters. the busby berkeley-type "aqua" number with bathing suited-sardines coming out of the can, and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! <br /><br />all of the above, and more, was in the first half of this slightly longer-than-normal length cartoon. the second half was about a king kong-type which escapes from the "animal crackers" box and terrorizes everyone. that part was not much, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. so..... an "a" for the first half, a "d" for the second, making it about a c-plus or b-minus overall.
