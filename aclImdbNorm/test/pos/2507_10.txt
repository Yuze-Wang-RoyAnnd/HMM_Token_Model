i'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and ex-boxer, and i love this movie.<br /><br />it's no "mystic river." it's a piece of fluff. but there is room in life for fluff, and when that fluff is engagingly shot, well-acted by attractive, likable people, cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it.<br /><br />i'm not the biggest tom selleck fan. but he's good in this. so are julianne nicholson (love her bald head and freckles), ellen degeneres, kate capshaw and even tom everett scott (that thing you do!).<br /><br />the scenery is nice, the mood is upbeat, there's heartache and wistfulness and farce and even a little redemption.<br /><br />any (male) reviewer who disses this movie is, shall we say, not perfectly confident in his masculinity. in the meantime i'll continue to catch bits and pieces of it without apology whenever it shows up on cable.
