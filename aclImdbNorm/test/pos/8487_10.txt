jamie foxx was the epitome of ray charles. after a few moments you stop seeing a film and see a biography played by the great man himself. ray charles was truly a genius of music and the movie excellently depicted that. no one has ever or will ever write, play, or record music like this musical giant. when he passed the flesh, the world lost one of it's greatest american heroes. as far as the movie, the fact that jamie foxx received a classical music scholarship to college and could play like ray was an asset to the director. what could be better than that? you don't have to have a "double" play piano and then try to split the screen from someone else's hands to jamie's face. it worked beautifully. i loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult ray was. he wasn't always a nice man. you didn't also root for him. he was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes just plain hard-headed. but i guess that's what made him genius so i can't fault him for that. i pick jamie for best actor!
