the movie jennifer with ida lupino and howard duff is film noir magnificence.this is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see.jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time, which made the movie have a surreal like quality at times. i love the stark black and white film noir movies.film noir in color is not as good.the cast and script is excellent.the rather creepy music is fun to listen to.ida lupino is one of the best and talented actresses to ever grace the screen.i have never seen a production that she was in that i did not like.she was not only breathtakingly beautiful,she was a fine actress.the first movie that i remember seeing ida lupino in was roadhouse with richard widmark and cornel wilde.i never forgot the movie,or her. i saw her last films like food of the gods and women in chains, and even though the movies were not her usual fare, she was still delightful in them as an actress.howard duff is always terrific to watch.i highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone.i have this movie on vhs tape.
