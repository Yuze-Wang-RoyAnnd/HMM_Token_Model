i first saw this movie when i was in elementary school, back in the 1960s. i was fascinated with the character played by ingrid bergman and it was my introduction to the french quarter of new orleans. the first part of the movie is the best as she comes back to exact some revenge on her father's wife and daughter (her mother had been driven out in disgrace). during this time she meets the wonderful clint maroon, played by gary cooper. the chemistry between the two is great. the second half of the movie takes place in saratoga, ny (the saratoga of the title) and i never enjoy it as much as the new orleans setting but it's still very good. i give this movie a ten - partly out of nostalgia but mostly because it's just a darn good movie and the characters besides those of bergman and cooper are equally wonderful (flora robson comes close to stealing the scenes from bergman). it used to be shown on tv periodically but it's shown rarely if ever - it would be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles.
