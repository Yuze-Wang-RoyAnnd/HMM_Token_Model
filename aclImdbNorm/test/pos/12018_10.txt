this is one of those films that, for whatever reason, just clicked with me. everything about it is right. eric roberts laconic, nice investigator, his voiceover narration, the twisting plot, dan hedaya and denis lipscomb given good roles, the settings, the paintings in the artist studio scenes, the end credit sequence and the wonderfully haunting theme music that perfectly encapsulates the mood of the whole film. if i have any reservations it is about beverly d'angelo as the femme fatale, but she plays her final scenes beautifully. i think that director matthew chapman was trying for a sort of 'chinatown' feel to the whole thing. it didnt work. but as a murder-mystery its a gem.
