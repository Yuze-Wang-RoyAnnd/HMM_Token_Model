i've read approximately 10 reviews of this film, but haven't taken any of them "to heart". harrison ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and i really don't see what any of these things have to do with the film. as i recall, he had bad hair plus bad reviews in blade runner but it's still a favorite among us videophiles. it is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the trashings it has received.<br /><br />i would gladly pay $7.50 just to watch a bald harrison ford mow his lawn.
