i have watched this movie countless times, and never failed to be charmed by it's homely simplicity, sincerity and goodness. great characterizations by all of the cast, and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role.i confess i fell in love with roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day, the nicest present i could have had.
