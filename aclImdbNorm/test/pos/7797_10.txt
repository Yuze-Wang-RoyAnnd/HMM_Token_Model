this movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!! salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles. after 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this.
