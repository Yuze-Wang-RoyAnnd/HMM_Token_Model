i was a huge fan of this series. yesterday i watched it again on dvd. i was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not? but in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. acting wise rakesh bedi(raja} & satish shah is brilliant whereas swaroop sampat is plain bad but i think she gets the job done. maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her. this series shows what good, clean comedy is.<br /><br />if this series were to air in the current year i would have given it 9/10. and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good. i give it 10/10. i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd.
