i don't know why all of the critics say this was a bad movie, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. tommy (chris farley) and richard (david spade) are a great match. tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college, finally passing with a d+. richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in school. how can you not laugh when the two of them are singing "superstar" by the carpenters passionatly and all of a sudden the hood pops up? in all this is a great movie, i recommend it.
