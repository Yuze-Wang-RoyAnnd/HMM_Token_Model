'fame' (1980) is brilliant. it's got all these qualities that made the late 70's movies so great. it is proud of its directness and not ashamed of being over the top.<br /><br />what really matters here, is the journey, not the destination. ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality, will never realize that 'fame' is about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not about their careers.<br /><br />ironically enough, none of the very talented actors of 'fame' made it in hollywood. 'fame' marked the end of an era. the end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. it's the last statement of a generation that had a voice of its own.<br /><br />10/10
