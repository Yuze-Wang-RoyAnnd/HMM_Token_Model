this is a classic movie that dramatizes the plight of a man who cannot adjust to changes taking place in society and feels more and more alienated, which leads to violence. joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and all he is needs is a pretext to lash out, which is what the story is about. alone, joe is quiet; together with someone else, he becomes lethal. and what makes the character of joe even more chilling is that he fully rationalizes his violence so that to him it's not only not bad, it's necessary. for joe projects his own violent tendencies onto those who he considers "the enemy" and therefore considers himself to be in a war, and in this movie, the "generation gap" is portrayed as a war. but it is a war in joe's mind only, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. nobody wants to fight joe, but joe feels he must defend himself. although this movie was released in 1970, it's message is as relevant now as it was then as society continues to undergo major changes which lead to the kind of intense alienation that the movie effectively dramatizes.
