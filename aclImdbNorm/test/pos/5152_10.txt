roy anderssons "du levande" is not totally original as it is counter piece to anderssons previous movie "sanger fran andra vaningen". still the movie has aura of total originality. some conventions of movie making are still thrown away: most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time. most of the time camera doesn't move but people move around it. the shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions. w.g. sebald comes to mind in literature with same technique. because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes. there is a story and isn't - it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind. this movie is positive. it is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices. one of the messages i got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all. great movie.
