this movie is simply excellent. for some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in india. in new york, however, i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie. this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india. everyone gives a good performance; amir khan; however, just takes over and puts the movie over the top.
