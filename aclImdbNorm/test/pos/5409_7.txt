the kinks warned about media heroes. outside the movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people." society demands some role playing, but what happens when that extends to the parent-child relationship? do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa? how do you provide a role-model but not a role? a brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; a brilliant musician who won't play. offbeat, funny (despite depiction of "serious" problems), very good multi-dimensional acting by everyone. lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension. celluloid heroes never feel any pain. i don't recall ever being disappointed in a sigourney weaver film (i even liked "the village"!).
