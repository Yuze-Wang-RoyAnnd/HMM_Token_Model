saw this last night at the 7th annual nyc home film festival -- a rather tumultuous venue that quieted down for this sweet and touching two-woman film.<br /><br />the relationship between the two -- one, older and blind, the other, a twenty- something who helps her with her mail -- is established deftly, and its depth is readily apparent.<br /><br />there are no car chases, explosions, or mind-boggling special effects -- just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans reaching out toward each other to help and be helped.<br /><br />see if it you can!
