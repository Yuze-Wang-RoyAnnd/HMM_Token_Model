when i watched this movie when i was a kid i didn't understand the premise of hitchcock movies, and dark comedy. now that i'm in my mid 20's it makes a lot more sense.<br /><br />i think the reason i like this movie so much is that the comedy duo of billy crystal and danny devito make for some interesting comedy, both slapstick (the frying pan and car scenes) and verbal (the arguments/conversations over murder and writing).<br /><br />the story revolves around larry donner(crystal), a struggling writer who has his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife margaret (played by a surprisingly radiant kate mulgrew, aka capt. janeway from star trek: voyager).<br /><br />while he shifts between writer's block and teaching creative writing class, he meets with student owen lifts(devito), an aspiring writer and overgrown mama's boy who sadly still acts like a kid. he has toy train tracks, need i say more? think of failure to launch, only matt mcconaughey is short, fat, and bald.<br /><br />owen is stuck in his own life, with a demanding evil mother(anne ramsey) who he can't stand. he seeks larry's advice on how to get out of it, and when he says to go see a hitchcock film owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills larry's wife, he'll return the favor and kill his mom for him. hilarity ensues while the two try to deal with each other's problem. owen goes to extremes to kill margaret while larry, who refuses to agree to do his "part of the plan", is driven nuts by owen's mother.<br /><br />throughout the film, larry and owen slowly but surely form a bond of friendship that is rare in dark comedy nowadays. one part of the movie i really loved was where owen shows larry his coin collection, and lets just say its more a sentimental collection than anything.<br /><br />the two main stars aside, the late anne ramsey is hilarious as mama, and deadly with that cane of hers. she's a lot more comedic verbally and physically in this as opposed to her role as mama fratelli from the goonies. so she curses like a sailor and belittles her son at every turn, but thats what makes her character so vivid. she makes her character the kind of person you love to hate.<br /><br />another treat in this movie is the music of jazz great brandford marsalis, who plays larry's neighbor and friend lester. there is a great moment in the movie where he plays jazz for larry, who is depressed and needs some good tunes to relieve the pain. jazz can do that.<br /><br />in closing, i wish billy crystal and danny devito would do another good movie together, but their kinda getting too old for the game i'm sad to say. this is one of those rare movies where both stars shine in their own subtle ways. devito's childish comedy and crystal's sharp wit made this movie for me. 5 star comedy.
