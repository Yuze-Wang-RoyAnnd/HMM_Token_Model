ok, anatomie is not a reinvention of the horrormovie-genre, but nevertheless it is well done. good actors (potente and f"uhrmann at first) and some nice ideas made me happy. maybe i would have been not so positive if this wasn't a german movie, but who cares. it is good to see familiar faces in a good, thrilling story, with some gore and some good jokes in it. all of you complaining about the dubbing: i didn't see a dubbed version (of course) but i believe that it is not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. we (germans) are used to watch movies like that, so it's not a big problem. but try to watch in german with subtitles. the actors are really good!
