agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. i remember the series well as i was in the florida keys when the show had its debut. i was looking through old vcr tapes that were "keepers" and came across two that had about eight episodes. i ended up spending part of christmas night (and the next) watching these shows. the singer was bankie banx - saw his name come up on the credits. he's from anguilla and owns a beach front bar called the dune preserve. he's a longtime friend of jimmy buffett and bankie's classic song "still in paradise" is featured on the latest buffett cd/dvd combo called "live in anguilla" - it is track #12 on cd 1 and #8 on the cd. i too would like to someday see this short lived series come out on dvd. keep the faith!
