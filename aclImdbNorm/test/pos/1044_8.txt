i absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (barbara stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful connecticut home. the trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a ww2 hero as guests during the christmas holidays. why is she worried? because she lives in a small new york apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all! hilarity (and romance) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face/ keep from being fired by the magazine owner (played by sydney greenstreet). this is a delightful comedy; one that i highly recommend to classic movie lovers!!!!
