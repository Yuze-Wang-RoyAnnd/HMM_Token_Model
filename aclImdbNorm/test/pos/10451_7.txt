yes it's a fast times wannabe, but it's still decent entertainment.<br /><br />some of the comedy parts are really funny. the scene when the three guys visit the spanish lady is hilarious, with a little flamenco music in the background. the reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot. the guys' exploits in dealing with crabs are funny as well when they try to "drown them" and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /><br />the abortion scene is a fast times ripoff too, but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation. you really feel for what karen is going through, and for gary in his mad scramble for cash to pay for the abortion and accommodating her recovery.<br /><br />the ending is painful to watch, but refreshingly realistic. first-time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock.<br /><br />there is a decent eye-candy for guys with young girls and the milf spanish lady, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis-measuring competition. <br /><br />underrated soundtrack too. check out early, early u2(!), the cars in their prime and an appropriate tearjerker song by james ingram for the surprise ending.<br /><br />some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated, but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early 80s should like it.
