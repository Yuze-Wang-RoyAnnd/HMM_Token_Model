in order to pull off a job like this caper in rififi (e.g. the score and its opines), one has to have nerves of steel. this one apparently demands and commands it. jules dassin is the master.<br /><br />i was on the edge of my seat throughout. it deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, one supposes, to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical hollywood of its day.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it.<br /><br />i cannot give it enough stars.
