i think that the costumes were excellent, and the hairdressers also performed well. it has the very authentic feeling for that period of time.<br /><br />i don't know if it was the computer magic or if it was real. some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge.<br /><br />the main character the actress also performed well, she showed us a nervous, witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants.<br /><br />some of the scenes were hilarious. even though it was about 2 hours long, but it was never boring. a very good entertaining movie.
