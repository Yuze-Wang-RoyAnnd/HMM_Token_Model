now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life, when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy, but this film really spoke to me. jane is an everywoman: although she has so many positive things going for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. she is strong and intelligent, but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second-choice life. she seeks out new challenges and happiness, seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart. dreya weber is an exquisite jane. as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her desperation and, eventually, the strength of her conviction. the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production. allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing. i highly recommend this film; although it's low budget, it has big budget writing and production values. ps- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. women will love the story and characters, but there's something for the men here, too. :)
