i caught this film at an outfest screening in los angeles in july, 2006. it's rough around the edges (sound recording in particular is wobbly) and often very funny. the script is rather jarringly episodic and ends abruptly, but ash christian infuses the film with lots of genuine heart. it's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesn't star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys. props to a warmly sympathetic jonathan caouette as mr. cox, a kindred spirit to rodney (ash christian), the lively and spirited ashley finke as rodney's best friend, and deborah theaker as rodney's mom, who is given the best one-liners in the script and steals her every scene. the film is like its writer/director/star
