wow. at first i thought who writes these things! how hard is that choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth, respectability and security as opposed to a husband who offers you only oppression, abuse, degradation and poverty. however our choices are not always as clear cut cut as one would think. indeed the wealthy gentleman was all a woman could aspire to and yet... the pull of her husband, her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. what to do, what to do?? as a viewer you became as confused and misdirected as she was. anyway what i really came on this site to gush about was my admiration of the voice of the engish, i thought, although it is actually the voice of an irish singer in the film. looking him up i find he is glen hansard, whom i had never heard of before that day. what a find. i am so grateful. wow, what a voice! what a day! thank you biff!
