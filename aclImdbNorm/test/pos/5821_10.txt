oz is by far the best show ever to grace television. better than the sopranos, yes, er, yes, csi, absolutely. uncompromising, daring, and utterly disturbing yet profoundly moving. oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television. tom fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing. no topic is taboo. rape, drugs, murder. oz is evidence of just how good tv can be. it follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your everyman tobias beecher, in jail for vehicular manslaughter. we see what we don't want to see, pain, death, mayhem. oz will disturb you, make you cringe, make you look away, but most of all it will make you think. to see oz is to see a truly magnificent television production
