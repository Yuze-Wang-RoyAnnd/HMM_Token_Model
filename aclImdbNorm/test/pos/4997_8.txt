there have been some harsh criticisms of comanche moon on imdb. i think this is for three reasons. first, purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not exactly like the book. second, it's not as good as the original lonesome dove. finally, people like to complain on imdb and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments.<br /><br />i would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book. that's just the way it is. lonesome dove wasn't as good as the novel it was based on. additionally, the movie of lonesome dove had some things left out ans switched around. that's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything. so its a futile argument when looking at comanche moon.<br /><br />i do agree it's not as good as the original dove. but hey, nothing is. i know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the dove. if i was going to compare every book i read, movie i watched, and tv i viewed by lonesome dove; i would be perpetually unhappy.<br /><br />this is a made for tv miniseries based on a prequel to lonesome dave (the novel) and sequel to dead man's walk, and that's what you get. it's the best tv i've seen in years. it's a fun set up for lonesome dove. we get to learn about the history of the rangers we came to know and love in dove. zahn does an amazing job in recreating gus mccrae. elizabeth banks and linda forenelli (sp?) also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and newt.<br /><br />if/when it comes on again, i promise you'll enjoy it more than some crumby reality show.
