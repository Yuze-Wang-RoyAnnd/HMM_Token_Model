although i brought this film by accident (i thought it was the original halloween(stupid eh!)) i was surprised by how good it was, many sequels just continue the events of the previous films, this however tried and succeeded in explaining the events of the prequels, why does michael myers kill people and how come he seems to have supernatural abilities. i thought this was a top horror film full of action, suspense and surprises, i'm very glad i brought it. i've given it 9 out of 10.
