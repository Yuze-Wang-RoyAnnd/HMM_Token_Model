like many situation comedies, "the war at home" is getting better with each episode. the characters are starting to become real and i believe them as a family. i agree with many that the first few episodes were not that funny; i thought the show would be canceled for sure. but with the absences of "malcolm in the middle" and "arrested development," "war" provides much needed live action comedy for fox on sunday nights. and when compared with the rest of the sitcoms airing right now "war" is an even better choice.<br /><br />its appeal, at least for me, lies in its real situations. teenagers have sex. not every parent likes how their kids are turning out. parents fight and call each other names. but rather than relying on being "mean" like many shows, everything is nice in the end which is the number one rule of a good sitcom.<br /><br />one detraction from the show is the narration during/in between scenes. the "arrested development/family guy" style of flashbacks work well enough but the narration can be too much.<br /><br />so anyone who needs something to watch on sunday nights should check out "the war at home," especially considering what is on the other major networks at that time.
