i have seen most of the tarzan episodes. certainly the rated x with o'keeffe & bo derek, which is totally deplorable.<br /><br />i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown.<br /><br />all the cast had memorable parts, great acting the ape sequences.<br /><br />last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish.<br /><br />as far as hudson not wanting andie's voice he did nothing until the very end. he viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach.<br /><br />it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that hudson attacked andie.the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin. the last time i checked carolina was in the usa.<br /><br />she was beautiful in movie and her eyes, and gorgeous hair, alabaster skin mystified all us males. she did not have to resort to bo's level.<br /><br />she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie (half her life ago),as a starting point. her performance, sincerity, made this movie enjoyable, believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty.<br /><br />great sending point for sir richardson, he did steal the movie.
