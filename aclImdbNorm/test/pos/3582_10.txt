the entire series, not just the blue planet, is nothing short of amazing. the best nature series we have ever seen. the episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! we have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. we read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. there is so much new information that we never learned in school. its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system. the amount of time and effort put into capturing these shots is very much apparent when you sit down and watch this series.<br /><br />a must see for everyone.
