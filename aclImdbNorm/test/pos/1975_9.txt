this was a great movie, i would compare it to the movie the game. you get to the end of the flick and cant move... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. dont plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened.<br /><br />dont come to this movie expecting the matrix style multi millions spent on special effects, this movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie. great acting, great plot... very enjoyable film, i cant say enough. also very original plot, plenty of twists and ideas that i would have never thought of. the ending is abrupt and leaves you hanging wondering, was that real? is this really the end? good ending, not saying that it is bad... just leaves you wondering, and a little frazzled.<br /><br />great movie for those who like action, like a good plot (dont get up for a bathroom break on this movie, you will come back lost) and like mind games, because thats exactly in a nutshell what this is.
