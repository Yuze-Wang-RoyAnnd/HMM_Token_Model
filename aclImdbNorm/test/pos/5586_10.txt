this movie appears to have been overlooked by everyone. someone should bring it out on vhs and dvd. it is an excellent film and far superior to the one with brooke shields, which was terrible. <br /><br />jean simmons deserves more credit than she is getting now days. it would be nice if all her films were offered on vhs or dvd. jean simmons was, and still is, a very good actress. she certainly was a beauty. in fact, she is still a beauty. she also has done extremely well on t.v. she is so much better than many of the actors today.
