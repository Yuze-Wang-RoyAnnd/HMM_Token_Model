i remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of donald crowhurst in 1968, in the golden globe single handed around the world yacht race. i was a 13 year old, living in england. the previous year francis chichester (later sir francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. i remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white tv!) and then his knighting by the queen. it provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the uk. it all seems so quaint now. chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped half way, in australia, to re-fit his yacht, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping.<br /><br />it's important to remember that this was a world pre-gps, when communications on land were still pretty erratic, never mind in the middle of the ocean. now with gps receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth, it's hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally, vanish. as donald crowhurst did. <br /><br />a number of yachtsmen signed up (all men back then), including mystery man, crowhurst. essentially a weekend sailor, crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise, including careers in the british army, the air force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. he wanted to do something big with his life, and he saw the five thousand pound first prize (well over $100,000 in today's money) and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business. he signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat, and which meant failure would bankrupt him, and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race. now the brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the 'pros'. (think eddie the eagle losing endless olympic ski jump competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the grand national horse race.) the public queued up to see him set off, but his boat wasn't really ready, and even as he started (the last competitor to leave the uk) crowhurst must have known he didn't seriously have a chance. but too much was riding on him to quit.<br /><br />in the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife's face. left behind with their 4 children, she is interviewed movingly throughout the film, together with one of crowhurst's sons. she was in a no-win situation. had she attempted to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but afterward she was riven with doubt, as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him. faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. laid up offshore argentina and brazil, out of radio contact, he waited for the leaders to round cape horn and start back up the atlantic, thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe. he elaborately falsified his logs, and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan. but as one after another the other competitors dropped out, he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized. unable to face certain detection, his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. his yacht was found. he never was. <br /><br />this beautifully edited film also follows the journey of bernard moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic french sailor, who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize, when he abruptly left the race, unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face, and sailed into the wide blue yonder, eventually pulling up some 10 months later in tahiti. having spent some seven years working at sea myself, (albeit on very different ships to these) i well understand the pull of the ocean. standing on deck, seeing water in every direction to the horizon, knowing there's a couple of miles of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull, without easy access to tv or radio (even nowadays on most working ships, you feel pretty isolated), it's possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. there is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long, lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough, but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea, the search for self. <br /><br />i strongly suspect that robin knox johnston, the ex navy guy who won the race (and many since) probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off, which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route. those who went searching for something profound within themselves, may not have entirely liked what they found. <br /><br />the marvelous archive footage of britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this, (did it really look quite that bad? i don't remember it looking quite so dowdy, but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past?) but overall, it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie. highly recommended.
