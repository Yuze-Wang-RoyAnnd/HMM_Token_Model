lets face it, australian tv is for the most part terrible, but this is a real diamond in the rough that not enough people are watching. the chaser crew who do the satirical newspaper and cnnn try something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded skits and political satire into one show filmed in front of a live audience, sorta like rove, but funny. they love causing controversy and this causes some of the shows funniest moments, especially chris telling his wife to "f-- off" live on breakfast television and julian handing a novelty cheque signed by saddam heusein to the head of the awb. it has to be one of the funniest aussie shows since the micallef program.
