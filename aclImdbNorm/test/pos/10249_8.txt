at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece (set in the early 60's, complete with a flawless motown soundtrack). but there's so much more to this film - it gets better every time i see it. the cast of unknowns (at the time) is excellent, and it is notable as an all-black-cast film that doesn't fall into any blaxpoitation clich'es - at times cooley high almost feels like an updated, urban neo-realist film, with lots of edgy humor added in. at times, the rather tight budget does show, but the constraints actually serve the film well - there's a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar-minded films (like schultz' later car wash, which was more popular, but largely pointless) warm-hearted but also true-to-life, this might be one of the sleepers of the 70s - celebrated at the time, it seems that few film freaks know about this one today. their loss - this is a fine, fine film.<br /><br />the bare-bones pan-and-scan dvd (no widescreen!?!) is testament to just how little cared-for this excellent film is.
