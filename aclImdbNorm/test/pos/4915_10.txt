when this showed at the seattle int'l film fest i was the only person standing and clapping and cheering. the rest of the crowd booed or was silent. it is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity. it is about a real man; and does not play to the insipid hyper-buffed muscular "gay paositive" that passes for the genre of non-porn gay cinema (and that is why so much of contemporary gay genre movies are so dull). this movie is intense passsion and great tragedy. the acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic; it all keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate. don't miss this if you can find it.
