it is the best movie on acting i have ever seen. all the artists are old turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie.it is sometimes said that "they do not act, they live it", you can really see this in this movie. the director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good. but after the acting, the most outstanding part is the content of the movie. it gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, importance of real friends to people. we all started to live individually nowadays, in this film you see that there are someone other then us. and most importantly, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love, loving your friends, loving your darling. all people should see this movie...
