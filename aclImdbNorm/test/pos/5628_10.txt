anytime i'm not giving 150% to my dreams or my goals i think of mark borchardt, the real-life subject of "american movie". mark's dogged persistence at having his first feature film produced and shot is so captivating that it will have you laughing, shaking your head with sadness and rooting for him.<br /><br />i haven't seen a documentary this honest since the movie on r. crumb. the supporting "cast" (mark's real-life family and friends) are all great. give this movie a chance and you'll see a great film and a wonderful portrait of the stuff that the american dream is made of.
