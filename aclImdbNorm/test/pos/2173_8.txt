colonel chabert is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen i have seen in the movies. it combines the realism of french cinema with excellent characterisation, from depardieu's lost chabert to fabrice luchini's proud lawyer to fanny ardant's complex widow. the movie has wonderful dimension, as you might expect from a top cinematographer such as yves angelo. the characters keep this movie in gear and although a bit slow in the beginning, picks up pace and is a fine movie by the time it reaches the finish.
