honestly, this is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. i was captivated by the story, petrified of captain howdy and on the edge of my seat for the whole ride. i do not really understand all the negative reviews.<br /><br />the set up has already been discussed in depth; captain howdy is an on-line predator who sets up meetings with teenagers, abducts them and introduces them to his favorite pastime of body modification and piercing. dee snider is captain howdy and he is one of the scariest psychopaths ever created; maybe the scariest because he is so human and you get the sense (especially if you are into body modification at all) that there are really people like this in the world.<br /><br />but the biggest reason i liked this movie and the reason it is so horrific is that captain howdy becomes the hero. at the beginning of the movie, the roles are clear-cut; the victims are innocent, the cop is the good guy and howdy is pure evil. by the second act, however, things have changed a little. you want howdy to be evil but it turns out that he is really just a victim of circumstance and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. it is terrifying to find yourself cheering for the "bad" guy.<br /><br />a couple people have mentioned that strangeland should have been broken into two separate movies. to be sure, there are definitely two separate "acts" but this movie works so well because the two acts are back to back. the first act is the typical psycho-thriller but the second act is the most disturbing because of the viewers reaction to the situation. i do not think it would have worked quite the same if the second act were expanded and turned into a sequel.<br /><br />as a big horror movie fan, i highly recommend this film. it is the first horror movie ever to give me nightmares.
