typically spanish production - slow-moving, but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress paz vega. (watch her in "spanglish"). great sets, lots of colour - you get to see cordoba, seville, spanish mountains and countryside. the plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (i managed to, even though the film is in spanish), you'll get the gist of it.<br /><br />it's about how one very highly sensual young gypsy woman, carmen, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding. carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works. she persuades jose, the soldier in charge of taking her to prison, to let her escape. jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks basque (he is navarrese and speaks the same language). jose is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier. he later meets carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. but carmen refuses to commit to him, and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle. in a jealous rage, jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with carmen. they then have to leave town. life on the run turns jose into a bandit. carmen, meanwhile, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. in the end, jose loses his mind and ends up killing carmen.<br /><br />the story is told by jose in prison, awaiting to be executed. the person he tells the story to is prospero merrime, a french writer and anthropologist, whose fancy watch (it plays beethoven's fur elise) was stolen by either carmen or jose.<br /><br />worth watching for the sets and for the delectable paz vega.
