this is a hard show to watch. it's not something to sit back and relax to. it kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. people get screwed over, raped, tortured and die like flies. there are male organs everywhere, there is excrement, puke and blood. oz is a brave show. it brings up issues like racism, homosexuality, prisoners reality and most of all; -capital punishment. it is, in my opinion also successful in doing so, unlike for example, the single-tracked "medium".<br /><br />it bored me sometimes. it had some weird story lines and they spent to much time on characters that just didn't interest me. strangely enough, i found season 1 to be quite boring. if i had watched it while it aired i think i wouldn't have continued to watch it. i love seasons 2 - 4. season 5 and 6 are watchable, (although i think it shouldn't be allowed to utter the words "cyril" and "death row" in the same sentence)<br /><br />there are so many marvelous characters to root for. the old guys bob and busmalis, who i absolutely fell in love with from day one. said, adebesi, pancamo and schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. augustus hill, who's monologues tied the episodes together so efficient. the staff with people like sister pete and ray mukada-also brilliant. also minor characters that was only in for a couple of episodes or a few seasons, but left a good impression as well.<br /><br />my favorites are the o'reily brothers. their relationship was the most gut-wrenching and warmest i seen on television. if there is anything i will always remember about this show it's them. there will never be another "pairing" or what to call it, that will make me ache so much. thats why, when the ends come for them as well, it almost hurt to much. i wish it would never have happened. i wish i had never watched it.<br /><br />but good one fontana. i do recommend it.
