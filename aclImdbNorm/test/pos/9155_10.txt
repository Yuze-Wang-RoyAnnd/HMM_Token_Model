i loved this show but then i don't remember ever not loving anything he did, starting with "americanization of emily". a town sheriff who keeps trying to steal the town blind and ride off to mexico, gotta love it. like everything he does it has a tongue in cheek flavor that brands it as a garner product. james plays the same character in lots of his shows and movies but somehow it never gets stale.<br /><br />p.s. re: killing off the main character<br /><br />if i remember right the "good" brother was killed off and replaced with the "evil" twin in an effort to increase the ratings i.e.; make it more like every other western on tv at the time. i think this show was too far ahead of its time and i still miss it. tv without a jimmy g show is missing something.
