absolutely the best thing i have ever seen on tv. it was both entertaining and informative. the reason i found this site is an attempt to find out how i can again see it.<br /><br />in the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with gen. leslie groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the manhattan project. most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past. <br /><br />the casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding. it was the first time that i noticed sam waterston as an actor. except for height he looked very much like robert oppenheimer.<br /><br />the early scene in which oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me.
