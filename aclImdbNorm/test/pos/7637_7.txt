"cherry" tells of a naive, unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby but isn't quite sure how to go about it. this easy going little sleeper is full of quirky characters and tongue-in-cheek situational humor. fresh, fun, mold breaking stuff, i happened to really enjoy this flick...for whatever that's worth. recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.
