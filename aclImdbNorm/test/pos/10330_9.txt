i absolutely loved this show. never understood why it was called bug juice though. i must have been about 13 when it came out. i remember they ran it over the summer holidays on channel 4, between re-runs of pugwalls summer and saved by the bell or something like that. i remember sitting there and wishing i was at summer camp too - ha ha. all the kids in it looked to be having so much fun, it was all about "discovering who you are" and "growing up." first kisses and all that stuff. i remember there was this really cute guy in it, i think he was the main reason i got up in the mornings that particular summer. they should have more teen docu-soaps like this, i thought it was great!
