i'm a huge fan of legendary director elia kazan . his movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. be it obsessive love in 'splendor in the grass, poverty in "a tree grows in brooklyn" or racism in "gentlemen's agreement." while looking for other movies made by kazan, i stumbled across a movie that was based on a novel by arthur miller. the movie called "focus" stars william h.macy (who happens to be one of my favorite actors) and laura dern. it deals with anti-semitism in a very realistic way. <br /><br />macy's character seems to go along with the bigots in his neighborhood and on his job, until it affects him personally. that's the key here... the reason he acted wasn't because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand, he acted because he was now considered an outsider, and he began to experience the same looks, the same remarks, and the same brutally that mr. finklestein (david pamyers)experienced .<br /><br />the movie is very well written and well acted. meat loaf does a awesome job of playing a dirt bag! both macy and dern's performances are outstanding! it's easier in life to go along with, instead of going against. sometimes in order for people to take a stand things have to impact their lives, or the lives of their loved ones...only then will some find their moral compass.
