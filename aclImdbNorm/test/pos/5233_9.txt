this movie is important to those of us interested in western history because it makes use of authentic techniques in its production.<br /><br />the scenes of the wagon train are particularly authentic; so far as i know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating the techniques for river crossings at a bluff. the horses and mules have to be lowered to the river level and the wagons let down by ropes and pulleys. the scene is such that i could watch it over and again just trying to get a feel for what a crossing was like...and the early travelers did it time and time again while crossing the country.<br /><br />melodrama aside, this picture is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth watching for that alone.
