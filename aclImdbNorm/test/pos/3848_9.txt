the aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on imdb. the songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the jungle book, but they weren't bad at all. the animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of paris in general. it looked beautiful. this is probably disney's most relaxing animation i think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? another great piece of animation was o' malley looking into duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.(a good thing)the plot(about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me of bailey's billions) was a little unoriginal, but worked very well, and the script was really funny, especially the fights between the kittens. they remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. my favourite scene was the chase of edgar with the two dogs, who were always fighting about who was the leader. the voice talents were a delight, most notably phil harris, whom i recognised from the jungle book, and eva gabor, from the rescuers. the supporting characters, namely scat cat, were also well done. in conclusion, a really pleasant film, that is definitely underrated. 8.5/10 bethany cox
