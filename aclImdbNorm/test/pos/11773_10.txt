this ranks as my favorite movie of all time. it's the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever; the fact that it was a sendup of star wars just made it all the better.<br /><br />i love slapstick. think of this as the marx brothers or the three stooges meet star wars. the writing is hilarious. the effects are a hoot. the free association that goes on guarantees all sorts of things coming out of left field. (i almost wet my pants when the wookie monster accosted the princess.)<br /><br />space balls was a much longer movie, but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it, and i felt sort of ripped off afterwards, like buying a burger that turned out to be mostly filler. hardware wars, despite being only about 15 minutes long, would be worth paying a feature price, imo.
