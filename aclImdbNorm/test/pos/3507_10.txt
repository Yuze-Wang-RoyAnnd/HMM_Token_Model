"just before dawn " is one of the best slasher films.it very realistic and atmospheric.it reminds me tobe hooper`s "the texas chainsaw massacre " and "deliverance ".deborah benson very good plays the heroine and director jeff lieberman created very creepy and dark movie."just before dawn " is beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing.i never<br /><br />liked slasher films or gore except with this one.very impressive and convincing movie ( at least for me )
