this was a very gritty movie about anti-semitism. however, unlike gentlemen's agreement (that also deals with anti-semitism), the movie has aged well and doesn't seem heavy-handed. in other words, it deals with the topic without seeming preachy or trite by today's standards.<br /><br />robert ryan plays one of the most vile characters, as he beats a guy to death just because he's jewish. robert mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crime.<br /><br />i give the movie kudos for its gritty and unflinching look at hate. it is in many ways an example of film noir--even though the topic isn't about the usual gangsters or robbery.
