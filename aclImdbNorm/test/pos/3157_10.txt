it's funny because i read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. you'll probably either love it or hate it too. i think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. i'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about afghanistan and iraq. i have to admit that i was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place. especially afghanistan and i feel guilty about that. the music through the movie was beautiful. i kept getting lost in it especially during some of the historical flashbacks. personally, i thought the audio was great. it seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches, music and the radio was put together so that you feel like you're in the rv with jim, the main character, or in his head. everything not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. anyway, this is a very amazing dvd which made me cry.
