i saw this movie as part of the midnite madness at sitges. set in 18th century england, the plot covers the life of arthur blake from his first outing as an apprentice grave robber to his final confession on the eve of his execution.<br /><br />the plot moves along via a series of misadventures involving arthur and his partner encountering various unsavory characters and bizarre situations.<br /><br />the first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the hammer period horrors, the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden graveyards, rowdy tavern scenes and excellent set/costume design.<br /><br />for a movie titled i sell the dead, i was expecting the emphasis to be mostly on horror
