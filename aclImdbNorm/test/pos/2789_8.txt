l'auberge espagnole is full of energy, and it's honest, realistic, and refreshing. not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in barcelona for one year. beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack. if you're older, this movie should bring back a flood of good memories. if you're young, learn by this example.
