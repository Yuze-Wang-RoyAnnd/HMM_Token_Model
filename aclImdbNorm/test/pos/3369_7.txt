even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. alright, more than a little... my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.<br /><br />don't watch this movie expecting another darko. darko fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. donnie darko is a thing of the past, get over it.<br /><br />richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it. <br /><br />the deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address.<br /><br />summary: creepy old man tells cammeron diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. to spare my fingers the typing... for pushing the button, diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race.<br /><br />i liked: the willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. its different. its intense. it has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy 101 material). it leaves you guessing. not a hollywood ending!<br /><br />i disliked: why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? what god like alien has the patience for that? diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? they live in virginia. <br /><br />i give it a 7 because kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies. overall good flick.
