one reasons why they call the 80's, "the awesome 80's" is quality television. shows like the wonder years, war of the worlds (the series), v, amazing stories, and many more have always left an impression to each "fortunate" one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself. to top that, here comes monsters! a series quite unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters. may it be the good, the bad, and the morbid.<br /><br />if you're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you. provided you can find this rare gem. <br /><br />even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness, it's indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity. i guarantee, because i'm 23 :).<br /><br />be sure not to miss this!<br /><br />although, it's a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember...
