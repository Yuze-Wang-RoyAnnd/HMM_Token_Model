a film is beyond all expectations, an excellent insight into the human condition. what exactly drives mila to have her ass painted. what could push a human so far that there only way to escape is to have there rear passage repeatedly painted by strangers.<br /><br />this film is not afraid to stair squarley in the face of the ass painting issue. simply breathtaking. roll on the sequel or whatever comes next from the geniuses who made this.
