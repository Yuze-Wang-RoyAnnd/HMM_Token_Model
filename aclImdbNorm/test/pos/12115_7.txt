when i saw this movie at age 6, it was in the childrens' section at erols video because it was animation. we watched it and it was a whole different ball game! a very violent story and graphic deaths are very entertaining and compelling, but not for children. avoid for family viewing, my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart!
