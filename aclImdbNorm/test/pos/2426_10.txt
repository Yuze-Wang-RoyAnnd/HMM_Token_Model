first of all, let me say this film isn't for everyone. it has a very strange subject matter. a spinster living alone and living a boring life discovers a young man in a park just across the street from her townhouse. she notices him sitting out in the rain and invites him in to dry off & warm up. the man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute. still, she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him. he finds her odd and continues his silence although we find out later that he isn't mute at all and that he reports to his sister everything that is going on between him & the woman. i won't give away the rest of the plot. if you can find this film watch it. you cannot take your eyes off of it. what makes it so interesting? well, it is totally unique. i've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. especially when you find out what this bland, boring, obsessive spinster is capable of. you won't forget it soon.
