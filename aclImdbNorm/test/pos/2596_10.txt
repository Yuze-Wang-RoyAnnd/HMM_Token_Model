chuck jones's 'rabbit seasoning', the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, i would have to concede that 'rabbit seasoning' is the most finely honed script. here, the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costello's 'who's on next' routine. as a long term daffy fan, i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous "pronoun trouble" being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe. part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration "you're despicable". as intricate an example of chuck jones's impeccable timing as you'll come across, 'rabbit seasoning' is a true classic.
