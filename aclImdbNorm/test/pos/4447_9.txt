what a surprise this film was. i've seen a good few of fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. he also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. the dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'manhattan baby'.<br /><br />the photography in this film is fantastic. a strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered. a scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence. <br /><br />what went wrong lucio? perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film, and it slowly went downhill after that.
