excellent drama about 2 alienated, spoiled punks who go afoul of the federal government, each for his own reasons. one, a druggie, just wants to score some bucks for his next fix, but the other has a far more sinister agenda fueled in part by a resentment of his father. good performances and a hot script makes this a winner.
