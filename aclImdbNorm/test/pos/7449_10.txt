what is there to say about this movie? this movie is simply gorgeous. a true feast for the eyes. in the same way that the game set the standard for 3d role playing games 7 years ago, this movie sets the standard for future cg movies. many of you have seen the trailers and the amazing details in every frame and let me tell you this movie does not disappoint. you can actually see the fibers in cloud's sweater vest.<br /><br />the music is also very good. the movie contains several rearranged tracks from the video game that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate.<br /><br />the movie's main weakness is its story. its not exactly a bad story, but this story is exclusively aimed for people who have played the video game. first time viewers may feel lost at times, or they may not notice the significance of certain events.<br /><br />i recommend this movie to everyone, even if you've never played the game because what we have here is a special movie. watch it and enjoy the the beautiful show.
