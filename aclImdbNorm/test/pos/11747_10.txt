i regard this loving, and sensitively written story, to be one of the screen's true masterpieces. after having seen this film, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in los angeles, california when it first came out, many years passed before i would have the opportunity to experience it again. the beauty, quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me, set it aside from many, many others of its kind. yes, tears still come to my eyes when i see it, and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song. perhaps still, today my number one all-time most beloved film. i would hope, this classic love story will be enjoyed, and appreciated, by our future generations.
