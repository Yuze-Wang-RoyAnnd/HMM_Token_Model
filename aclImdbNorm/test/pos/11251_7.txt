i am from texas, and live very close to plano where the actual deaths occurred, so i might be a bit biased in saying that "wasted" is a film that you just can't get out of your head.<br /><br />stahl, phoenix, and paul all play their characters very realistically. you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts. the drug content is handled very graphically as well - although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose, and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking. i definitely recommend this film to anyone. once you watch it, it sticks with you!
