"children of wax" also shown as "killing grounds" is an interesting mixture of genres. some might think the purity of the genre can be only for good but to me the eclectic symbioses is very entertaining. it is also in it's story the mixture of thriller and the popular action as well as the combination of the historic masterpiece and the ethnic plea for tolerance. this film is built with the starry presence of my favorite actor the perfect armand assante but it is also marked by the acting of a shooting star
