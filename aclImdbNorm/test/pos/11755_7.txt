this movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. nevertheless i enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of william holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of jennifer jones. there are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could've been trite lines. the cinematography of hong kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie. all in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.
