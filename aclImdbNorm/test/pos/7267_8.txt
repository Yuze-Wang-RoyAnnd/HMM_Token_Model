.. is the princess bride meets... well trainspotting. but wait, really, it's a good combination! this was definitely one of the better movies i've seen in a long time... it has the kind of witty dialog i associate with the princess bride or cemetery man, along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie... the heroic feel of princess bride combined with the (this is odd) lack of any really good guys that trainspotting had.<br /><br />i'm not saying it was as good as the princess bride, but it was in the arena, and it rocked. some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - while slightly anacronistic - are anacronistic not due to their intrinsic nature (there were flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century, contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks) but just in a bit of the language they used. the anachronisms made it fun, though, and not cheesy and easily dismissed.<br /><br />if you've ever read any simon r. green, or gleen cook's garrett series, you know exactly what this movie is. check it out. it's great.
