columbo is guest lecturer for a criminology class. the students invite him along for their after-class get-together. transiting the nearby parking garage, they discover their regular teacher, next to his car, dead from a gunshot wound. (no, columbo was not after the man's job.) as a class project, columbo involves the students in his sleuthing.<br /><br />two students, tentatively identified by the viewer as culprits, were in the lecture hall for the entire class. furthermore, surveillance camera tapes of the parking garage show that no one other than the professor entered or left after he was last seen unexpectedly departing the lecture hall.<br /><br />reversing the normal routine, columbo is the one that is pestered by the evil (?) duo, eager for progress reports and an ear for their theories. forensic evidence is almost nonexistent. solution of the case hinges on some eventual and interesting good luck.<br /><br />on first viewing, it seemed that columbo had swallowed whole the culprits' misdirection; however, on repeat viewing, small details revealed that not to have been the case at all.<br /><br />this reviewer has yet to tire of "columbo goes to college."
