this is a great off-the-wall romantic comedy about love, work, pandering to the public taste, and midlife crises. the main character is a talented movie director who decides to make a silly pg-13 movie to get himself out of hock with the irs. it has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadpan to slapstick), and fine writing. it's also a wry send-up of the movie industry. the metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the movie that's being made, and in some places the film departs from strict realism. the result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor.
