**1/2 elisha cuthbert, chad michael murray, brian van holt, paris hilton and jon abrahams. directed by jaume collet-serra.<br /><br />yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. based on the 1953 vincent price film house of wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like tobe hooper's 1974 classic texas chainsaw massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture. director serra showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching. my final rating 7/10.
