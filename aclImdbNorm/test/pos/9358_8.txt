"crossfire" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that's a murder mystery with a strong message. it stars robert young, robert mitchum, robert ryan, sam levene, and gloria grahame, and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk. we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, young, as the detective, finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. the victim, joseph samuels (sam levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and samuels winds up dead.<br /><br />i don't know about 1947, but seeing "crossfire" today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. i don't suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. nevertheless, the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence, and unsparing anti-semite language.<br /><br />the characterizations are vivid, including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role - she's a woman who meets mitchell (george cooper), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan, but everyone is excellent. robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife.<br /><br />truly excellent, and a must see.
