it's bad for ya really showcases more of george carlin's talents. he really is still as sharp as a tack. it is a shame that we lost him this past year, but his comedy will forever live on. this stand-up special is literally one of the funniest i have ever heard a comedian perform. even though he is making fun of small children, it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff. it is true that carlin can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear. i really enjoyed this stand-up particularly from carlin and recommend that those that liked this check out more of george carlin's stand-up.
