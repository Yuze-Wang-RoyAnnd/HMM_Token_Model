fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, allegra geller (jennifer jason leigh) whose latest game - "existenz" not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). since she forced to stay out of sight, allegra is stuck with ted pikul (jude law), a marketing trainee ("p.r. nerd") to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth. director david cronenberg has, well, used some bits from his earlier films ("videodrome", "scanners", "the fly", etc.) and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing. law and leigh are fine here and so are some of the supporting cast (ian holm, willem dafoe, sarah polley, christopher eccelston, and so on) that has an international twist to it. dafoe is anything but devilish as gas, a deceiving garage mechanic. one of the movie's best scenes is witnessing ted eat (fish and frogs) and construct a gun and admit to allegra - " i can't help myself." "existenz" manages to show that he (cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and it still works like a charm.
