scientist carl lehman (well played by david mcilwraith) gets blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. he has his brain transplanted in the body of a nearly indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by wicked obsessive fellow scientist alex whyte (a perfectly hateful portrayal by richard cox). lehman embarks on an all-out killing spree. it's up to nasty mercenary hunter (a wonderfully loathsome turn by the divine pam grier) to put a stop to him. director jean-claude lord, who previously helmed the under-appreciated slasher psycho thriller "visiting hours," stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a zippy pace throughout, thus ensuring that this flick sizes up as an enjoyably trashy sci-fi/horror action outing. paunchy character thesp maury chaykin easily cops top acting honors as disgusting fat creep burt, who in the movie's single most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with lehman's pregnant wife lauren (a winning performance by the lovely teri austin). stan winston's nifty make-up f/x and paul zaza's thrilling score further add to the overall sleazy fun.
