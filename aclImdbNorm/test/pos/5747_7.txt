this is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face. i'm a christian and liked the film in one way. it had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see. it can be a bit long-winded, but the film has some quite nice cars that rescues it from a lower rating from me. as a christian film it was quite good, but maybe a bit right-on in the message. the film works best on a big screen. *spoilers* the fighting scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the christian thriller "mercy streets" starring eric roberts.*end of spoiler* i give it a 7/10.
