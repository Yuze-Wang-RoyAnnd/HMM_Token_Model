odd one should be able to stumble into "classe tous risques" only by chance; it should be on any "best of film-noir" list, including imdb's.<br /><br />lino ventura is as good as ever; knowing of his dire, delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost expressionless face and brief dialogues. belmondo's restrained performance under sautet's firm direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should -have been.<br /><br />"classe tous risques" is utterly mininal, dry and cold, without melville's artistic scenery, pretty faces and fancy cars. it is almost film-noir meet neo-realism. davos' few, hard words to his children describing their life of secrecy from there on get a hold on your throat to the end of the film. <br /><br />the final sentence of the film - a voice-over telling of davos' end in no more than ten dry, sombre words - leaves you with a hard punch in the stomach.<br /><br />a true jewel in the great crown of french film-noir.
