this is a very dark movie, somewhat better than the average asylum film. it was a lot better than i thought it would be, is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film. <br /><br />the voice on the telephone is really creepy - this voice without a face, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film, since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the spectator.<br /><br />the action and suspense never decay and after the first half of the film, it becomes vertiginous; there is not much gore in this film, just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention. <br /><br />i gave this movie a 8/10 because some clich'es.
