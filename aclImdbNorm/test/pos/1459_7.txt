a group of teens that have broken into a huge department store, are attacked by a crazed police man. exciting and suspenseful throughout and refreshingly devoid of extreme violence and gore, but those aussie hairstyles and accents are a bit much to take. and they can induce headaches. but this is still a good thriller. 7 out of 10.
