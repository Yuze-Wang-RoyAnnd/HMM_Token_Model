this columbo is unique in that we don't really know the exact outcome until the very end. our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle; each points the finger at his brother. in a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice, and this was columbo's time. other than that wrinkle, this episode fits in well with others of the series. it has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny performance by jeanette nolan as the fastidious and loyal housekeeper who takes an instant dislike to columbo.
