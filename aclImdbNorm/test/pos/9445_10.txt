i loved this movie so much. i'm a big fan of amanda bynes's recently ended show. i admire her(besides her body) for her acting capability. she is a good actress.<br /><br />the movie was great. its about a girl named viola who wants to play soccer, but when her school cuts the girls soccer team she gets upset. her brother is set to go to a prestigious school and he decides to leave to england. so viola wants to make an impression by playing on the soccer team at the boarding school. she goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team. she gets in. meanwhile she meets duke who is a sensitive guy who plays on the soccer team. he really likes olivia (laura ramsey) who likes sebastian-who is really viola. sebastian is dating monique and suspects that sebastian isn't being himself.<br /><br />this is certainly not a chick flick and i enjoyed it a lot. its so funny and lovable. i don't think i have seen amanda act better.
