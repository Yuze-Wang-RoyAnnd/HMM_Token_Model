i really like the movie's opening, when col. ted masters realizes on his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about 10 o'clock. the good news is that the movie does not mention at the very beginning that the colonel, along with a wingman fighter who was a lieutenant, was trying to do a "freedom of navigation" exercise along the eastern meditteranean sea, but went a little too past the restricted air space zone reserved for a rogue middle eastern nation as they accidentially fly past it.<br /><br />i also like all of the intercutting on the colonel's fighter radar readouts and computer displays as the enemy aircraft aggressively picks the two american fighter pilots into an engagement for violating their airspace. that first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot movie, "top gun." from the waxing of the enemy bandits to the enemy aircraft's thirty-milimeter rounds that struck the colonel's jet engines and forcing the plane down, forcing him to eject, all of this reminds us of one thing...dogfight fighter techniques can keep you alive...but one false move can cause you to be shot down.<br /><br />the only problem in the movie was the "snake sequence" scene. it was a little bit too long. yes, the movie's opening was great when you see the conflict...which was the dogfight engagement. only when one boy tells doug masters that his father was shot down after the cessna planes landed in the "snake" race, forces us back to the time the conflict already started. i guess the snake sequence in the middle should be interrupted a little bit by col. masters being dragged in handcuffs in the middle of the bilyad desert on his way to the detention center...while the music sequence for the "snake" continues. the film does not do it...if it were, the conflict's details would have been smoother at that point. still good otherwise.<br /><br />when word found out that col. ted masters trial for high treason (violating territorial air sovereignty) was over and he was condemned to be hung on the gallows in three days, doug masters decides to go into action. with the air force having futile attempts to save the man, doug decides to pull his friends and col. sinclair (played by louis gossett jr.) for a plan to rescue masters. risking a high chance of facing a court martial and spending more than a year in a military stockade, he goes against air force policy and makes a plan to rescue masters without consent of the u.s. government.<br /><br />doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get plenty of stuff on the area where masters is held for the upcoming hanging, and the surrounding area around bilyad (which turns out to be a fake middle eastern country for the movie). one plan included shooting off firecrackers outside the air force darkroom area as a diversion to get classified photos and maintenance stuff on the fighter aircraft, fighter base, intelligence, and all of the other military stuff around bilyad. <br /><br />when all was said and done, and sinclair studied all of the intelligence, he almost rebuffed at that plan because doug was way too cocky. not until they get the two f-16 planes and tried a dry run across a firing range that i realized what they were going to do overseas. i realized that doug's fighter shooting and bomb dropping is not good until he hears rock music. i can remember when he dropped one mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed by 20 feet....i realized that doug is unusual. he likes music when he fires the fighter ammunition.<br /><br />the last part of the conflict, the final dogfight action in "iron eagle" was better than top gun's climax of the hostile dogfight sequences. i liked the way the final conflict unfolded, especially when doug masters faces off with an middle-eastern ace fighter pilot who actually ran the trial against ted masters. short but sweet when doug took the enemy fighter out after a second try by a side-winder missile. looks like this bilyad colonel was akin to "darth vader" in star wars....in the air, he can be very evil, because if you have seen star wars, darth vader was actually anakin skywalker, who was an ace pilot in space. unusual connotation for this but still works!
