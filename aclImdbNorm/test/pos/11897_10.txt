this movie was a modern day scarface.it had me on my toes.this movie is one of those rare epic films that makes you want a sequel.i especially liked damian chapa his performance deserved an academy award,which he deserved for his performance in blood in blood out.the only thing i didn't like was the behind the scenes because it didn't show the intensity that the movie had,and i would have like to have seen less narrated scenes.but the movie was great and it is in my top ten movies of all time.plus the acting was great there wasn't a bad scene in the movie,i loved it ,jennifer tilly was perfect as well as all of the cast.i can't see how anyone wouldn't like this movie it was a great.definitely a must see.
