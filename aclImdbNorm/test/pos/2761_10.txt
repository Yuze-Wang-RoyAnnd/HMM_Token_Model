graphics is far from the best part of the game. this is the number one best th game in the series. next to underground. it deserves strong love. it is an insane game. there are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. waste your money on this game. this is the kind of money that is wasted properly. and even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. actually, the graphics were good at the time. today the graphics are crap. who cares? as they say in canada, this is the fun game, aye. (you get to go to canada in thps3) well, i don't know if they say that, but they might. who knows. well, canadian people do. wait a minute, i'm getting off topic. this game rocks. buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it. it's pure brilliance.
