the black castle is one of those film's that has found its way into a boris karloff collection and is mistakenly expected to be an outright horror movie. whilst some horror elements exist within nathan juran's movie, this really is a multi genre piece that's tightly produced and effectively portrayed. joining karloff, in what is a small but critical role, are richard greene, stephen mcnally, lon chaney jr, rita corday, john hoyt & michael pate. it's produced, unsurprisingly, out of universal international pictures. the plot sees greene's english gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister count von bruno {mcnally}. he's following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is fraught with danger and surprise at every turn.<br /><br />this has everything that fans of the old dark house/castle sub-genre could wish for. genuine good and bad guys, a fair maiden, dark corners for doing dark deeds, devilish traps, ticking clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain. the cast are all turning in effective performances, particularly greene and the wonderfully sneering mcnally. whilst jerry sackheim's writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar film's of this ilk. a very recommended film on proviso that karloff fans understand it's not really a karloff movie, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans don't expect blood letting to be the order of the day. a fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout, the black castle is a fine viewing experience. 7/10
