we've just watched the last of the series shown on the sbs network and will miss our weekly dose of danish delight. my wife and i picked up the show after the swedish show "the eagle" finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on tv. week by week, however, the show grew on me, and whilst not as glossy as the swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed.<br /><br />prior to these 2 shows i had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say i am now but the 2 scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern euopean countries through the eyes of their special policing units.
