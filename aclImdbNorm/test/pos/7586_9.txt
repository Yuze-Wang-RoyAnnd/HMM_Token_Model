i have seen over 2000 studio-era sound films-- including lots of judy garland, lena horne, shirley jones, and deanna durbin's own universal features-- plus a decent amount of live and studio-recorded musical comedy and opera. and i assure you, no one tasked with singing in front of a camera and microphone, or maybe anywhere ever, has ever touched durbin's solo here...mono soundtrack and crap 1930s microphones and all. the kid from canada sings this bit from "il bacio" like she lived and wrote it herself and then happened to show up for a retrospective in italy late in her career, not like a child who learned it from her music teacher.<br /><br />if you skip this extra on the dvd-- or skip ahead to the garland solo-- you are just depriving yourself, since this cheap mgm teaser just happened to capture one of the greatest performances of the 20c.
