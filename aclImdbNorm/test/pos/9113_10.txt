tenacious d: in the pick of destiny tells the fictional tale of the formation of the band tenacious d and their quest to find the pick of destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from the tooth of satan himself (played by dave grohl). jb (jack black) and kg (kyle gass), joined together by fate, must travel to the rock n' roll museum and steal the pick of destiny to become the greatest band on earth. the movie is hilarious and delivers non-stop laughs. jack black and kyle gass work perfectly together, having been real life friends and co-workers for over 20 years. the film is in part, a musical. all (or most) of the music was written and performed by the d. all of the songs are new material and many of them are classic. the soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. this film will be mostly appreciated by fans of tenacious d, but if you are not a fan of the d, i still think you will enjoy the movie. if you are a fan of the d, then you must see this movie. the acting isn't as bad as you may think, and the laughs and crudeness never stop coming. i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks rocked off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time. look out for cameos by dave grohl, ronnie james dio, meatloaf, ben stiller, amy poehler, tim robbins, john c. reilly, and neil hamburger. also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
