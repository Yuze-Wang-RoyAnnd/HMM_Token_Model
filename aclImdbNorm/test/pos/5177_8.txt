living just down the hwy from georgetown, co...i remember this movie well and thought it was great! the story seems like something john would do even in real life, but there is something that i will always remember most about the movie. for those of you who don't live in denver...every christmas, the city of denver, co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the civic center in downtown denver. well...as it so happened, during the filming of this movie, a nativity scene was needed. so...it was borrowed from the civic center display...with permission, by the way! someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be, and it was reported stolen! a frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days. finally, someone spoke up and remembered loaning it to the film crew in georgetown! it was returned and put back where it belonged! as it turns out...it wasn't featured all that much in the movie...you can barely see it during the christmas show with the children. it did create quit a disturbance though...
