i saw this movie last night at the phila. film festival. it was an interesting and funny movie that had some endearing and moving scenes. peter falk was excellent as was the rest of cast. they were believable and played their roles well. the movie may have gone a bit long and the conclusion was okay. the audience laughed at the right places. the family dynamics were terrific and though this was a jewish family, they could have been italian, irish or any other including greek. i recommend this film if you are interested in laughing at a subject that isn't often handled that way. iot makes you think about the consequence's of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those who are not clearly in your life.
