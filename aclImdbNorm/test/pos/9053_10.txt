now this is classic. a friend of mine told me about this flick, saying that it's incredibly lame, stupid, retarded, and moronic. he also said that i'd love it. <br /><br />to my surprise, i found it available from netflix and rented it at once. i'm just shocked that i had never heard of it before. if i could give it an eleven, i would.<br /><br />
