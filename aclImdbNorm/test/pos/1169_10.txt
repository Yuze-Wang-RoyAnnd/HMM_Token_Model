a movie i've seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie. i first saw it as a kid and loved the drama and the great climactic battle. as i got older, i enjoyed it as much or more than before, but now due to all of the components that work together to make a true classic. the acting is great (especially keith as t. roosevelt), the cinematography spectacular, the script is full of gems, and the directing pulls it all together wonderfully. it's loosely based on an actual event, and it shows rush of europe and a newly emergent america to carve up the 'sick old man' (the ottoman empire) as it collapses in a fashion unlike any other 'historical' movie i've seen. humor, drama, action, love...it's got it all and deserves far more acclaim (much like 'the great waldo pepper').
