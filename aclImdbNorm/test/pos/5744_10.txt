right, here we go, you have probably read in previous reviews on this film that it is awful, badly acted, avoid at all costs. well i suppose in some ways this is true, it is fair to say that you couldn't write a spoiler in this comment as there is no plot to spoil. however, there is a fine line between plain awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me this film is the latter. the acting is so bad, the plot so non existent and the ending so completely baffling it will have you laughing the whole way through. there are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level. do not expect an oscar winner but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster, it is worth every penny.
