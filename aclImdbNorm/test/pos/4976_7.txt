it's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor. in this case, i was intrigued by edward g. robinson's statement to barbara stanwyck - "i promised you the valley", as he discusses the lone hold outs to his attempt to control all the land in logasa. ten years later, stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the barkley family on "the big valley". somehow i thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture; i guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out one's youthful side.<br /><br />as for my summary line above, that's lee wilkison's appraisal of john parrish (glenn ford), one of those hold outs mentioned earlier, shortly after parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of wilkison hands after they raid his ranch and torch his home. i liked the way the film explored his character, starting with the way he dealt with foreman wade matlock (richard jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. the set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing. for that, parrish also had something to say - "never meet the enemy on his terms".<br /><br />"the violent men" is a good title for this film, and was probably at the head of it's class in the mid 1950's, though by today's standards doesn't come close to the blood letting one will find in a "tombstone" or "open range", where the bullets exact a nasty savagery. but it's shaped by fine performances from the principals, with a sub plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering it was stanwyck's character who was cheating.
