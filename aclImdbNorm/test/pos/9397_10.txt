it's really rather simple. the name of the movie is death bed, the bed that eats. if you are anything like me, you already know if you are going to like this movie. i stumbled across this gem at best buy the other day and picked it up for ten bucks. i got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title, and the box alone.<br /><br />i'm a huge fan of b movies. this is in my opinion one of the greatest b movies i've ever seen. now, it's not for every one.<br /><br />granted, it's not even for most people. as a matter of fact, i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie.<br /><br />for those of you who like b movies though, this film is a diamond in the rough. it has a great premise, a bed... that eat's people. it doesn't walk, it doesn't move, it doesn't have a siren call to attract people. it pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it.<br /><br />i loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks i've owned it.<br /><br />like i said, after reading the title of the film, you already know if you'll like it. if you laughed or smiled, then give it a go. it's worth it.
