i really enjoyed fierce people. i discovered the film by accident, searching through my on-demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch. the film is mostly about class in america, and it quickly grabs your attention. the characters are smart and articulate and the story doesn't stick to the usual hollywood rules.<br /><br />the main protagonist is finn, a precocious, but underprivileged 15 year old who spends his summer with the osbourne family. donald sutherland plays the patriarch, ogden c. osborne, the seventh richest man in america. diane lane plays finn's mother, a friend of ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut. the osbournes own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules. at first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super-rich are different. they are used to getting their own way. the film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog, superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns. it is also an r rated movie, so it's not entirely wholesome. <br /><br />the cast is excellent. anton yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of finn. sutherland and diane lane have never been better. chris evans is impressive as osbourne's devious grandson. kristen stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter. high quality movie.
