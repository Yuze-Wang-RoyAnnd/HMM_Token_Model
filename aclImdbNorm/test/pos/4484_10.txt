it's one of the best movies that i have seen this year ! i don't agree with the person who said it's boring. of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all, but personally i spent a very good moment. this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes. there is also a nice touch of humor. for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father, and then her husband says "how can someone abuse someone like you", and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games :d very funny ! i recommend this movie to everyone, and by the way, sorry for my poor english (i'm from france).
