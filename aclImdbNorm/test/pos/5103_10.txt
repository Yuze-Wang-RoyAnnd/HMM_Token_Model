peter o'toole, one of our finest actors, is magnificent as a reserved school master who is dedicated to teaching young boys. he meets a show girl and falls in love. the story is one of love and devotion. petula clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not too mention a remarkable voice. you will enjoy this film even though the ending might not be a happy one. i enjoyed it.
