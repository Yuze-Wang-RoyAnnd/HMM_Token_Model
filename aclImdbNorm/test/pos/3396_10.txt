perhaps one of the best movies ever made. orry and goerge's friendship runs deep, and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship. as a southerner, i can honestly say this epic is as accurate as it gets. brothers fighting brothers. can you imagine what life must have been living during those times? the best part of the movie, for me, was when the south surrenders; general grant is urging president lincoln to really stick it to the south, he says, "mr. president, a lot of folks want the south to bleed over what they've done..." president lincoln, turns to him and in a very tired voice says, "the south has bled enough...and so have we..." i burst into tears, and take a deep breath. what a president! it's like a father saying his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger he realizes his point has been made. this war was a very dark time for our young country, and it had to be fought. president lincoln knew this. i'm urging everyone who reads this to watch this movie, and add it to your dvd collection. then, thank god that our country was preserved. as jesus said, a "house divided against itself cannot stand."
