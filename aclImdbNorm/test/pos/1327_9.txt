i heard that after the first oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. i believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). this movie is even better than the first film! the original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed terry benedict's casinos. now, benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. to do that, they must do a couple heists in europe to get the money.<br /><br />the acting is very good. the all-star cast exceeded expectations. matt damon, brad pitt, and catherine zeta-jones were probably the best in this film.<br /><br />there are some confusing moments in this film. but that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. anyway, this movie is only made for harmless fun.<br /><br />overall, this is a great heist movie. i rate this movie 9/10.
