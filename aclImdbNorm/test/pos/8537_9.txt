oh my god. obviously, when you rent or buy this, you're not expecting to see a documentary on the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. you're expecting a visual feast of blood and gore and and maybe even a scare or two. well, for those who are as sick and twisted as myself, you won't find many scares, but you'll come very close to urinating all over yourself in laughter. the catch phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. the first time i showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago, but still we laugh our asses off and use the catch phrases. it's as addictive and funny as sam raimi's the evil dead ii: dead by dawn and peter jackson's dead alive/braindead. from the opening scene's absolutely ridiculous dialog, to the splatter and gore department's finest works, to the wondrous abilities of ed the film cutter, you will laugh and laugh again. as far as the visual feast of blood and gore, oh yeah, they've got it. and they're pretty damn good at it... "the neck-bone's connected to the head-bone..." this film also may have done the best nightmare/hallucination/totally effing nuts scene i have ever seen. and that one's not mean to be funny, but man is it well done (and creepy.) overall, to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a damn good time, if you ever see this movie get it!!!! it's on netflix, i know that for sure.
