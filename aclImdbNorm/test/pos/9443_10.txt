even an old cynical doctor who fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show . it happened previously during eccleston's finale and it happened watching this episode . it doesn't happen often though but the impossible planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very , very best . this is stunning television <br /><br />the doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience ( many of who will be moving behind the sofa ) are instantly transfixed . a door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time travellers . this might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence . you may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we're treated to a disappointing story then at least it's usually only for one week <br /><br />there is nothing to disappointment a viewer here . it is doctor who at its most traditional best . writer matt jones and director james strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come . they do this by constructing a doom laden narrative . the doctor and rose lose the tardis and they're stuck with the protagonists in the far flung future . it's interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the tardis which makes for a more intriguing type of story . without doubt the highlight is the scene where scooti goes to look for toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons her outside . everything from acting , make up and murray gold's music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience <br /><br />i can imagine immediately after this episode the bbc switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents saying how traumatised their children were . that it took them several hours to get them from behind the family sofa and that they're now refusing to sleep with the lights out . to do this complaining would be to deny the magic of doctor who . yes it can terrify and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child , something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred . but i will bet my life that these same " traumatised " children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they'll be allowed to watch the next episode
