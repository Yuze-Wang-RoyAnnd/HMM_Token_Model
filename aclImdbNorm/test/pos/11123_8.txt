we enjoy a film like "fame" because we imagine we are there ourselves - music, dance and drama students, enjoying our self expression. this film had humour, entertainment and must be an inspiration to young people to have a go at the performing arts. bravo "fame". certainly worth 8 out of 10!<br /><br />chris
