age cannot tarnish the beauty of this east-west love story for me. ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of counter-currents involving social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt, and the need for immense courage. with hong kong as the backdrop, this movie tells the story of a eurasian doctor and a u.s. journalist who meet and fall in love during the korean war. as mark elliott, william holden is intelligent, breezy and a bit weak; jennifer jones is perhaps well-nigh-perfect as dr. han suyin, by turns doubt-torn and ecstatic, eager and hesitant. others in the large cast include torin thatcher, isobel elsom, murray matheson, virginia gregg, richard loo, soo yong, philip ahn, jorja curtright and donna martell; many of hollywood's best oriental actors played smaller uncredited parts also. the script by john patrick followed han's exquisite novel closely; the direction by henry king was solid as always. the thrust of the storyline is how unwilling han was to fall in love with elliott, with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future; and how unafraid he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced as their affair became known. the film is unarguably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful also. the hill to which the lovers go to be apart, the lovely bay where they swim are set against an already busy and crowded business city, large social events, and teeming streets, hospital corridors, and traffic-filled arteries. with cinematography by leon shamroy, ben nye's makeup and helen turpin's hairstyles, the great work by set decorators, sound and lighting, art department and all concerned, this has to be one of the most memorable productions set in a major non-u.s. city of all time, and one of the most difficult to capture on film. yet what one remembers most here is the lovers, thankfully not extremely young, facing the odds against them and assessing exactly what they are--then going ahead as if love mattered and those conditions which are set up as barriers to love do not., the climax of the affair is mark's going back to war; thereafter han receives his letters, even after she knows he is has been killed; they seem messages from a better wold. a world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of admittance to that world, and it is always summer on a high and windy hill set apart and above a zone where beauty and individual desires can be victimized, made subject to ill-fortune or brushed aside by militant forces of evil. truly, love is a many-splendored thing, dr. han says; and this movie stands as one of that doctrine's shining proofs, lucent as a pearl, timeless as a chinese proverb and lovely as polished jade set against a rough background.
