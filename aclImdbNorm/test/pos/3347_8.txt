i remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in anaheim, california in october, 1976. while driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising "alice in wonderland xxx." so before even checking out disneyland's version of the lewis carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. i remember even before the movie began how surprised i was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative orange county.<br /><br />thirty two years later, i came across alice in wonderland at a local video store. i wondered to myself if this was the same film until i looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely kristine debell in the starring role and decided to rekindle some fond memories. subversive video, to their credit, has released two versions, x and xxx in the same package. as it turns out, the version my friend and i saw in anaheim was rated x in spite of the original xxx advertising at the there. seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director bud townsend brought to the screen. as an example of this man's scope behind the camera, in his salad days he directed two episodes of tv's death valley days.<br /><br />miss debell, appearing in the april, 1976 cover of playboy is ideal as alice. she brings a fresh all american innocence to the role as a librarian in her early twenties yearning for a better life. when her boyfriend is rebuffed from taking their relationship to the next level, alice reaches her turning point. this is a 'musical comedy' yet the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to offset the generally suggestive lyrics. miss debell has a pleasant singing voice as she trills about wanting to be free. that's when the magic begins. the pacing of this movie is surprisingly fluid, given the genre and the supporting cast of wonderland are there to enable alice as she blossoms into womanhood. special mention goes to tv veteran larry gelman as the white rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex as he is always running late for an appointment
