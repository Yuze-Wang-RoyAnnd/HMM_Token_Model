i thought this was a very good tv series and i would like to see it continue. it really got interesting there at the end and i really want to see where it is going from there. some times we are to quick to kill a series without giving it a chance. i think this one needs a chance to go on, and i will definitely be waiting for it. the ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and i think that is a mystery in itself. what is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world. it is even said that man maybe crawled out or slivered out of the waters many millennium ago. is this a new evolution coming about? are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position?
