i rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend`s place and it was an instant success.the classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70`s australian twist.the acting isn`t exactly shakespeare society stuff here,but later ,"mad max"star bruce spence is a beautifully understated surfie/scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by gary wadell and robin ramsay as a deliciously 70`s camp fairy godmother/father character.also note the musical contribution from ex-daddy cool frontman ross wilson on the title song.in a similar vein to later-day aussie comedies such as "priscilla queen of the desert".good fun.
