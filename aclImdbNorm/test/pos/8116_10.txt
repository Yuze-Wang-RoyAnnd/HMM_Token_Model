never have i seen a movie like this; didn't plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the tv channel. i am mostly a scifi movie watcher,but i would be more than happy to add this one to my collection. it starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle, then became something a little different(can't tell more then that. but it does involve two guys and one girl. juts not the way you would expect). also, this movie starred hugo weaving from the "matrix" and "the lord of the rings" in a role i would not have expected...very funny guy. this movie is playing on here tv, but if you do not have satellite, it is worth a rent. so give it a try; you won't be disappointed.
