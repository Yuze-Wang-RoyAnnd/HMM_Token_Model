having reviewed 3 of the 4 perry and croft sitcoms, i thought i would get them all done now. dads army, is my all time favourite sitcom, it ain't half hot mum is also a classic as is you rang m'lord. i don't regard hi de hi as a classic, but it is still funny.<br /><br />it's about a holiday camp, similar to butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. it is ran by jeffery fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. the staff include fun entertainment manager ted, his sidekick spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat gladys, careless maid peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the punch and judy man mr partridge who hates kids. situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).<br /><br />not a classic, but still funny. jeffery fairbrother left half way through, so this, a bit like only fools and horses, outstayed its welcome. jimmy perry was actually a red coat at butlins.<br /><br />best episode: peggy's big chance, series 2, episode 2.
