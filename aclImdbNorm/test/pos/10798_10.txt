when you think 'oliver stone' the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like platoon, jfk, born on the fourth of july, or natural born killers. talk radio usually doesn't. it's a pretty small movie, actually. more than half the movie takes place with barry champlain at his radio station talking into his mike. but believe me, this is one of oliver stone's greatest movies and should not be missed.<br /><br />above all things it's a character study. barry champlain is a rude, self-destructive, risk-taking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss, his lover(s), his fans, and even some nazis. he doesn't like his audience and callers and a lot of them don't like him (eithor that or do like him, but have no idea why). but, at the end he says on his show: "i guess we're stuck with each other."<br /><br />see talk radio, even if you don't like oliver stone movies. you might be surprised. i sure was.<br /><br />my rating: 10/10
