two young friends grow up together in afghanistan. the events of their lives drive them apart and one of them has now been living in the usa for a good number of years. as he receives a phone call it is clear that he has to return, for there is trouble in the air.<br /><br />this is a film about life lasting friendships, mistakes and making up again. but also a film about darkness, pain and endurance. from the pleasurable young days of growing up and playing games to the falling apart, back to the playing of games. this is a slow film, but not too slow.<br /><br />it plays on emotions and that is quite right for a drama, but it does so a bit too much for my liking. this makes it too much of a tearjerker, loosing it a bit of the quality it carries. it is still good, but not fantastic.<br /><br />7 out of 10 kites ran aground
