saw this film the first time in 1953 with my older brother. it was one of the great 3 demension films released in that era. we saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it. scott does a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by the indian arrows rather than surround sound. oh, for those polaroid lenses again.
