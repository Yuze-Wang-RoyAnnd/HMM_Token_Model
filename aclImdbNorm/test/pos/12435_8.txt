this film is just plain lovely. it's funny as hell and as old as the hills. the acting is superb and it's fascinating seeing post-war britain and how we used to behave in those days. this seems to have been some pre-runner to the st. trinians films (given the alastair sim and margaret rutherford connection - there's also a very young george cole in there who appeared in many st. trinians films) but i don't myself understand the connection. it was shown on bbc4 recently after a biography of st. trinians creator ronald searle, however i missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film. anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be preserved for all time!
