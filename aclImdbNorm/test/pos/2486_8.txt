certain aspects of punishment park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting. however i feel that this is probably the most important movie of the "war on terror" era. i grew up hating hippies and in some respects i still do. it wasn't until the united states was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in iraq that i began to see the world through their eyes. i can feel what they must have felt. although the film is somewhat dated, watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface. it's clear enough early in the film that punishment park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the "unpatriotic" elements of american society. this is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is credible. at times i find myself believing that the usa could easily slip into fascism. as i watched this film i could only think about how i hear similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily. this movie is a raw, concentrated distillation of america's present political scene. i am both impressed and saddened that something this relevant (and yes, accurate) was filmed more than 30 years ago. if you take a more moderate view of the movie and choose to believe that this couldn't happen here, look more closely at guantanamo bay, some of our "enemy combatants," the rumored cia secret prisons and the many incidents similar to the one in greensboro, nc in 1979 (8 full years after the making of this movie).
