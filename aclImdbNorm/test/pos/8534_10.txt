(spoilers warning) i cannot say enough good things about this movie. it is a great horror comedy/spoof that does everything right for a change. the humor is great and ranges from funny to so-funny-you'll-cry funny. in one scene, ed goes edit-crazy and deletes a big scene. when his boss is looking at ed's edit, he yells out: "where in the fu%# is my beaver-rape scene?!?!" hysterical. there are also many other great, humorous & memorable quotes and moments throughout: ed yells out "don't you fu#$ing look at me!!!" while punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face. very funny stuff. the plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it's priceless: ed is a mild-mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror-film editing department, and after a while goes nuts, sees monsters, and attacks people while quoting the horror movies that he has edited. this movie has it all and is simply hilarious. the dvd only costs about $7, and is a great bargain as it is the unrated widescreen cut. i own a lot of dvd's, most of which cost a lot more money than this one, but not many are as great as this movie. my evil ed dvd is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it. evil ed oozes style and quality -- something that hollywood filmmakers need to majorly learn. evil ed is a rare gem, and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie -- you did everything right, and i love evil ed! 10 out of 10!!!
