michael kehoe has accomplished quite a feat, especially considering it is only his second start as writer, producer and director. generally "first timers" lack vision and direction when helming a major production but "dominion" proves mr. kehoe is going places in hollywood! set with beautiful scenery, dominion boasts experienced cast members (especially thomerson & james) who communicate kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. few films can mix the slasher/horror genre with a genuine action/adventure feel, but dominion accomplished this completely. this film certainly qualifies as one of the top-notch films in both of these categories. if you are looking for fast-paced action with more than a modicum of suspense, look no further. i look forward to kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. well done!!!
