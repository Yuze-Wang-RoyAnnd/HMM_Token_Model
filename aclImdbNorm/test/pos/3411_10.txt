several weeks back i lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen years, a golden retriever named sasha. when i came home from the animal hospital, alone, after having made one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . .and we talked about this episode of the twilight zone. i could be wrong, but i recall a line that arthur hunnicutt said, when satan was trying to trick him into hell, but his dog could not go with him. . .and his dog in turn was growling in defiance at the gatekeeper who was trying to trick the old hunter to "step inside,". . .that it would be "one helluva of heaven if dogs were not allowed," and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (of what they had thought was heaven, to wander eternity alone.) what a tearful moment when they meet a "good ole' country boy" on that eternal road, only to discover he is an angel, sent out to find 'em, and "sure neighbor, of course dogs are allowed into heaven." <br /><br />i'll confess i cried as i talked about this with my daughter while we mourned the passing of our beloved golden. rod serling was truly a genius, a voice that in the early sixties spoke out against racism, hatred, "know-nothingism," and was a profound inspiration to me to become a writer. this episode, across forty five years carried a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend. i urge you to get a copy the next time there is a one of the twilight zone marathons or purchase it. there will be some tears, but comfort as well. as always, thanks rod, for all that you taught us. . .even now.
