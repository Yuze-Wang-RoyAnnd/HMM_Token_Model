this movie gives us some wwii history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. nicholas cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. and so do the other principle characters. one key charater, the physician/father played by john hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love i've ever heard. some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but i excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. my wife and i really liked the film. and it is nice to watch people taking the risks to love the enemy. one man who left the theatre near us said to his wife, "now that's the way to wage war!" i think you'll see what he means when you watch the italian occupiers of this lovely greek island.
