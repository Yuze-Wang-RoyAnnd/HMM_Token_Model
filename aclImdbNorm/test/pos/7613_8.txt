never been kissed starring drew barymore as reporter josie gellar is a sweet, extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named josie gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. she is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. only problem is josie has never been popular. high school was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally "fit in" as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story.<br /><br />never been kissed is one of those movies that's so sappy and schmaltzy at times, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. it is however, very sweetly done. drew barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely josie-she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. i also enjoyed leelee sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends josie on her first day at the school.<br /><br />never been kissed has some really funny moments as josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. example-the reggae bar scene.i also loved the appearance of josie's brother rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student, the way that he helps to give josie her "dream" of finally fitting in is just hilarious. at the same time, as josie's woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful. you do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to josie to be affected by her story-drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore josie from the beginning.<br /><br />there is a lot of "mean girls" a 2004 release, in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier. never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together.<br /><br />i liked this movie. it was really beautifully done in some areas. the movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious hollywood way? oh yeah yeah yeah baby! but it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. the movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. i have actually met people who have had similar experiences to josie-i've met people very much like all these characters-i think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. not unrealistic at all. what struck me was drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the "sheep mentality" that can exist so prevalently -as hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true. <br /><br />i'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is, in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture. it's engaging, sweetly acted and just rufus. i'd say check it out. 8 of 10.
