i saw this film when it was released to the minor cinemas in the uk some 50 years ago; and the memory remains of a great musical score, and the tragedy of the storyline. i saw it again on video recently. the sound track was poor and the picture grainy; but it is one of two films that i saw again the next day, the other being gladiator. the music theme is intensely tragic, and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death. certainly one of george sanders best performances; as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war, but nemesis waits; patricia roc plays a refugee from eastern europe eaten with despair. he is attracted to her, selflessly wants to help her, and then falls in love with her, but she is too proud and hurt to accept help. their love destroys him, and inevetably the girl and the doctor (herbert marshall), who brought the nemesis. the storyline is of complex intertwining destinies, where subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be. this is as a film, which diappointed the critics and struggled at the box office; but for the adolescent who saw it, and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films (taking into account its age)whose story is more akin to an opera.
