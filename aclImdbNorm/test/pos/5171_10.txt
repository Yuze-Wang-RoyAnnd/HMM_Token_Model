it was good to see john denver again though he passed several years ago. i found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night recollecting what christmas is all about. the scenes of georgetown, colorado were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately. as i sit here in my own mountain seen in so california i loved the story and the plot. i hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and i did. merry christmas! a great film for all the family too see. enoy and tell others about it. thanks for the memories. we need to have more films like this come out of hollywood.
