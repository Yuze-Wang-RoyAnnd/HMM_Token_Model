george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn. "they died with their boots on," paints a different picture of general custer. in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes, and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure.<br /><br />errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point. custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments. in spite of his poor standing, he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army. through an error, custer receives a promotion in rank. before this can be corrected, he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates. his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero. custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, libby who is played by olivia de havilland. libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry. custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans. to prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with crazy horse, the leader of the sioux . when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills, custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers.<br /><br />errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. olivia de havilland's depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender, more gentle side. the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn, who had acted together in several other movies, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife. the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland. anthony quinn as crazy horse, sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott , arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining.<br /><br />the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie. while it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. the movie has a little bit of everything. it has adventure, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a large variety of audiences. the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact. the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land.<br /><br />
