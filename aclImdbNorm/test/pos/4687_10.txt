i watched this series on pbs back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so. very atmospheric and creepy sometimes. this is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and acted. you are drawn into the plot and come to care for these people. the villains are almost laughably evil, especially the sheriff of nottingham. man, i would love to beat the s--t out of that snotty little bastard. nicholas grace does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the sheriff. his whipping boy, sir guy, is equally hissable but is also pathetic. lots of murder and mayhem in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of that nature. i noticed it got an award for children's television which is surprising. if i had kids, i would not let them watch this. outstanding use of locations in this show also. it is now on dvd, so go out and buy it.
