this is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it. the acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot. as a french "noir" film, its language is certainly a lot earthier than its american counterparts, but to me this just added to the realism. additionally, i liked how non-glamorous everyone was--particularly the husband and the lieutenant. about the only negative, and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a glaring plot hole. like another famous french film, dr^ole de drame, the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning, but the characters made rather stupid decisions. for this, you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching--the payoff is well worth the wait.<br /><br />this is simply one of the finest french films i have seen. period.
