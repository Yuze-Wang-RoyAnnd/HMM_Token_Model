some films are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, and to make you angry. i was angry during this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it was true, that america, the free, does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. the torture scenes in this movie were harrowing, the indifference of people was shattering, the film was compelling in its argument, and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. of course now that makes me a "bleeding liberal" labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. people who don't realise that as the movie said, for every person tortured,you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. you get an ever increasing cycle of violence. this film did not make me hate america, although i can see how it could do, but it made me hate the way that america has reacted in its post 9/11 world. there is a significant quote in the film, just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is "one american is dead" - that makes the difference. you cannot kill an american, america can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single american, or they will do whatever it takes, including torture to enact justice. this is the american way apparently. call me a liberal, call me naive (although i think the people who think torture is fine are naive) call me deluded, call me anything you like, but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in america and the west today. i wish this film would be shown to all school students, at a minimum. this film will stay with me a long time, part of me wishes i could forget it, because i wish this type of thing never happened, but i know it does, the other part of me wishes i would never forget, because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and i will be telling everyone i know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.
