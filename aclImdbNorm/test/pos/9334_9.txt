for those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again. but, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time. when this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before. now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of thriller will reveal its faults. why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? when michael jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses. after he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence. this may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time. it has continued to be a problem in the age of mtv. the best videos, like jackson's billie jean and beat it, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around. still, thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on halloween.
