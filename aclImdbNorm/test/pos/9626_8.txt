i saw five fingers at the drive-in in...what, 1973, '74? it was the the first kung-fu movie i'd ever seen and i was greatly entertained. i recently bought it on dvd and watched it again. i was greatly entertained the second time, too. i believe this is probably the one most kung-fu movies are modeled after. rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys. they even threw in the japanese (very bad guys) styles of karate and judo. i remember being amused by the dubbing dialog, along the lines of "hey you! you are a very bad guy!" and "they should not get away with this! i will have a go at this bad crowd!" this time it wasn't so distracting, i guess i'm used to it. if you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre, this is one you should see.
