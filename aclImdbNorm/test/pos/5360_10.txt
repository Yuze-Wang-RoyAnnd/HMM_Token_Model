being a "wallace and gromit-fan", i was looking forward for this full-length movie. surprisingly i saw it at the world-premiere in vlissingen (nl), at the film by the sea festival. a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie. it's about wallace and gromit (whom i believe don't need an introduction) having their own pest-control company in the city which is hosting a giant-vegetable contest in a few days. everyone, including an eccentric baroness, is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot. unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. this is where w&g come in. the have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way.<br /><br />it's a very funny and colorful story. anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of w&g (which are more than great!), will love this full-length movie. nick park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor. like in chicken run, it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames. "job well done, lad" ;-) oh yeah: the music was fantastic! it really completes the ride. enjoy!
