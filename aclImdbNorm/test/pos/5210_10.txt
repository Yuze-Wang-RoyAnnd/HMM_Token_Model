the people of my generation and those who are older know about the ww ii (or as it is called in russia - the great patriotic war) not only from the school textbooks, but from the witnesses and participants of the event. my granddad was a soldier at stalingrad and when i was a small girl i used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the germans. he also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. but it was long ago, and no when i have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of stalingrad, i have to turn to books and movies for information. somehow most films i saw were made in the soviet union, only a few in present day russia. and "stalingrad" is an exception. in the movie the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact in itself is interesting. all that is shown in the film is quite different from what i'm used to.<br /><br />the film reminds me a great deal of remarque's "zeit zu leben und zeit zu sterben", because the war is shown through an ordinary german soldier perception. and this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. the movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic europe, from the italian coast arrive in the snow-covered hungry soviet union. they are doomed to die; it is clear from the very beginning.<br /><br />after the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me; he said "if you start thinking, you will go mad". and to my mind it is true for spectators as well. from the one hand, one may think, ok, i'll just watch this movie and it won't dissipate me, i needn't feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa. however sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters. probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing kolya's execution.<br /><br />"stalingrad" is hard to watch, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, destroyed illusions.<br /><br />as far as i know, lt. hans von witzland is one of the few films where thomas kretschmann played his star roles. i watched quite many hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries, such as "next" or "transsiberian" (why did he do it?!). and after i had watched "stalingrad", i cannot make out the european actors desire to appear in american movies, even second-rated at any cost. the fact puzzles me deeply. i believe thomas kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in hollywood. and out of what i saw with him, "stalingrad" is the best, beyond the doubt.<br /><br />in my opinion the worst "stalingrad" drawback is the way they speak russian in the movie. i mean of course those who are supposed to be russian. say, the boy who spent some time with the germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent? initially i set down to watch "stalingrad" just to listen to native german-speakers because i'm studying the language. i did not expect anything extraordinary of the film. but it impressed me, made me cry when i wasn't going to at all. i know i'm 15 years late to watch it, but "stalingrad" is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking.
