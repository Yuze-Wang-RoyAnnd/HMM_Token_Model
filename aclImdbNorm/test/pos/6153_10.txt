"for a squadron leader - normally the only guy trained and equipped for navigation in a squadron and very hard to replace - to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot, no matter how close a friend he is, in the face of oncoming enemy troops, is hard to believe, especially when they both have to share a cramped spitfire cockpit - two into a skyraider, ok, but a spit?! come on, this part of the film is a biggles adventure, not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously!" as said by tord s eriksson (gothenburg, sweden) is rubbish. not at all biggles. one true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots, who planned and flew (illegally) a strafing mission over france. one had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire, while german infantry was moving in on them, and flew them both out of there. in a spit. they were both severely injured in former fights, one had an artificial leg from the knee down. now that may sound like something out of bigles, but it happened. ill get sources if needed
