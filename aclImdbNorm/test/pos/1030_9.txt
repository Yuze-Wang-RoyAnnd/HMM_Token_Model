oppenheimer was a great series (it was the first thing i saw waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. a similar situation exists for "glory enough for all", a british series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd. is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us? another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was "danger uxb". a series about defusing unexploded bombs, hence the name. that one you can get from your local library.<br /><br />pete
