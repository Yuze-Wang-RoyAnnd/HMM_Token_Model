this is one of my favorites. betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. one is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. the other is a playboy who has tired of gold-digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital, mature woman. if you've got silver in your hair and/or romance in your heart, microwave the popcorn, curl up with your honey, and prepare yourself for a treat.
