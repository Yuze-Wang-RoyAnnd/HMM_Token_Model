i went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released, i was 11 at the time. i remember how much i enjoyed it and wanted to live in shangri-la, that's how naive and young i was. i recently came across a video of the film i had recorded off television some years ago. i watched it again and am not ashamed to admit i still enjoy it as much now as i did 29 years ago. i also enjoy listening to the words of the songs, because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns don't pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection - we should be happy with what we see. this is what i call a "feel good" film because i feel happy after watching it. maybe i am still naive but it makes me happy and i'm sure it will make you happy if you watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is - a good, family film. i must be one of the few people who has this film on vhs pal video - and dvd (self-made). i recorded it on dvd as the videotape recording from tv was starting to wear thin. i still watch it from time to time.
