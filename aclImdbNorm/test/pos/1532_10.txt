i really love this movie. it has a very real feel to it. i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.<br /><br />this is an "a" movie and i recommend it highly. if you liked "1984" book or movie, i think you will like this one as well.<br /><br />this is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. not for the week at heart or stomach. no gore, but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn't need blood and guts.<br /><br />if you are not a realist or a pestimistic person i don't think you will enjoy it. it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans, what they're capable of, and the very real possibility that our government(s)does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it's heart.
