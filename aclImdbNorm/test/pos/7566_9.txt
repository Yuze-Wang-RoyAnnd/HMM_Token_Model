someone definitely has it in for the wind and i cannot believe that what i saw on the screen has much to do with it. this is a better and more solid movie than most of the independents i watch all year long. the cinematography displays a genuine love and mastery of the craft and the casting was just fine. i would love to see more of these folks, especially zeke rippy.<br /><br />as far as the story and script, i'm not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intent of informing anybody else about the movie. the long drawn out nit-picky bashing posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this site by the reviewer, are obvious slander directed at the producers of the film. i don't know the inside story, but it would probably make a good movie. what i do know from being around this biz, is, productions that try to make everybody happy usually end up being awful and when the filmmaker has the guts, drive and common sense to "kill the babies", someone always ends up with hurt feelings. that's part of the biz too, and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business. of course, the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those that snubbed them (read: were honest and truthful with them). and that is my best guess to explain the nasty, nasty reviews. in as much as there is a grain of truth behind everything, there is a point to be made, but these exaggerations of the grains are so over the top that they become obviously fictitious.<br /><br />it's not a slasher blood bath if that's what you're looking for, it's more the psychological suspense thriller, which typically is not appreciated by the lowest common denominators out there. the best way to see this movie is to try to expunge any pre-conceived notions, pop it in and let it unfold - seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say, i don't think you can come away with the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed. poorly understood perhaps.<br /><br />overall, i do agree that this is a nicely done, compelling movie. perhaps i would not have given it a 9 under normal circumstances, but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the picture (i have a secret love for really bad cinema). to me, the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shlocky, inept, poorly acted and stupidly written movies. none of that applies here - it is quality movie making with some real talent in there. i gave it the nine to to tip the scales back in the correct direction. watch the movie and tell me i am wrong.
