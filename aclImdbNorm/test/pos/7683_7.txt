i've been waiting 30 years to see this film. i played the soundtrack album as a teenager and through my 20s. recently, i located a reasonably priced dvdr and i watched it this morning. it was in widescreen, probably even a 70mm print, stereo, the colors were quite good, very little fading, certainly not remastered but i'm very very happy with this clean copy.<br /><br />now for the film. it's pretty good. i wouldn't say it's great though there are great scenes in it. perhaps premminger may not have been the right director for it, but i'll say this. for me the center piece of the film was the hurricane scene. marvelously staged by premminger. one of the great weather scenes of all time.<br /><br />in fact, i'd go as far to say that the acting scenes are better than the musical scenes, not that the musical sequences are bad. not at all. they did lack... something though. perhaps it was the fact that there are no close ups and very few medium shots. it was almost like watching a filming of a stage production. perhaps that was the feel that premminger was going after. in the end it may not have been the right choice, but so it goes. it is far from a ruined movie.<br /><br />having said that, not everyone loves the singers on the soundtrack either. i always have. they are perfect for this film. i love the singing voices. the actors lip-sinking are excellent for the most part. i just wish the songs were staged more imaginatively. sportin' life's two numbers are fine, but the intimate numbers don't even feel intimate. they just feel... far away. in spite of that, you cannot deny the power of the music. and in the end, that is what comes through loud and clear. once again, maybe what premminger was trying to do was to stay out of the way of the incredible music he was working with. i believe he had the right idea but perhaps went too far in that direction.<br /><br />the acting is terrific. top kudos goes to the great brock peters who acts and sings the part of crown. he is the ultimate meany. we just want him to leave poor bess alone, and he doesn't. as proud, arrogant and nasty as he is, sammy davis jr's classic rendition of sportin' life is the slick devil himself and a very charismatic one at that. arguably, davis's best film acting. poor bess just can't handle two bad men. i'm glad the hermes pan gave davis a tap dance number to do.<br /><br />dandridge and poitier, reportedly not impressed by being in the film, really are very sweet together. i don't know about chemistry... there was more chemistry between dandridge and peters than there was between dandridge and poitier. still, it worked out fine for dorothy and sidney.<br /><br />even so, i think they should both be proud of the work they did on this film. they both managed to bring more than one tear to my eye. their characterizations where very 3d and believable. sidney poitier's porgy, however, seems almost out of place in catfish row. i couldn't help thinking he was mr. braithwaite in "to sir with love", very educated and well mannered and spoken, fallen on hard times. he probably wouldn't have been my first choice for the part of porgy, but hey, he was a huge star at the time, so why not? dorothy's bess was as perfect as her carmen jones, in fact even more vulnerable this time around. carmen was probably the flashier part for her to do.<br /><br />a very very good film indeed, it is two sticks short of what i would call a classic. it just doesn't make the ultimate classic grade. still, there is no reason on earth why the gershwin estate has decided to keep this beautiful film, even with all of its flaws, hidden from the public as they have. premminger may have made some odd choices as a director, but the film is nothing to be ashamed and embarrassed about for anyone involved with it. it is what it is and there are a lot worse movies than this that are embarrassing out on dvd and in theaters today. porgy and bess is not one of them.
