as a dedicated lover of all things egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, land of the pharaohs". the sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so "neat" in the production quality. i thought victor mature was well cast and peter ustinov a real gem! the whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (i have yet to see the 1999 movie "the mummy but am sure i will love it!).<br /><br />top stuff!
