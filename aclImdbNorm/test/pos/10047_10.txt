i saw this film over christmas, and what a great film it was! it tells the story of custer (played by errol flynn) during and after his graduation from westpoint. although i've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate (hollywood never is) i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway.<br /><br />i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor! his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic! it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp (arthur kennedy) rode to their deaths on little big horn.<br /><br />i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and i grew up watching his films as a child. but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was.<br /><br />i'll give this film 10 out of 10!!
