rendition presents a very topical matter in the form of a very tense thriller. it's a gripping, and not a preaching, movie. seeing it in an arab country with a mixture of arabian and european audience gave it an extra level of atmosphere. the audience was totally gripped by the film and gave it a loud applause afterwards. the story of an egyptian, married to an american, picked up on the suspicion of links to terrorist organizations and shipped to a friendly (with us) arab country for "enhanced interrogation (as meryl streep's character states in the film: "we have no torture in the us") seems to be from the front page of todays news. there is a very neat link between the various characters which appear in the movie and the pace of the film never drops. the movies'message seems to be (as stated by jake gyllenhal's character in the film) that by abducting and torturing suspects you create many more terrorists. the acting is uniformly excellent with streep and reese witherspoon the stand outs. not to be missed.
