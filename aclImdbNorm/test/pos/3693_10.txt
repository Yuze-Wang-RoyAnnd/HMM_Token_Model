i found this movie to be extremely delightful.i am biased i suppose.i happen to adore kathy bates.i found her singing an added pleasure.she has a very nice voice.<br /><br />ms bates plays grace beasley.the film takes you from her doledrums married life in chicago to england,the home of her recently murdered singing idol victor fox.there she meets his three surviving uppity sisters.she also discovers that victor leaves behind a male lover,dirk simpson.<br /><br />the story leads you on to some surprisingly comedic and heartwarming situations as grace and dirk develop a true fondness for each other,after an initial rather rude rejection,on his part.they return to chicago where they team up with grace's pint-sized,hilarious daughter-in-law,maudie,to find the serial killer who murdered victor.<br /><br />everyone in the picture did a fine job.particularly enjoyed julie andrews,lynn redgrave and barry manilow.this movie was fun.it makes you cry.the music is absolutely charming.<br /><br />other posters here who found problems with any parts of this movie,just don't have a clue.<br /><br />
