after "attack of the fifty foot woman" with alison hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than dorothy provine from "it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world" to play the role. the downsize is that cute and blonde provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into allison hayes' size 50 shoes. this role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; provine is more the girl next door type. she may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy, but the material lets her down. lou costello, however, proves he can do a movie without bud abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to gale gordon as his front man for gags. gordon, however, establishes that all he can be is blustery, perturbed and pushy, much the same character he creates later on "the lucy show." charles lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man, and his screen time is limited. the special effects are convincing for the time, but i would have liked dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous. as the movie's lead character, she takes second billing to costello who is in all of the movie with dorothy several times vanishing like a sub-plot. the whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of the allison hayes classic. there's a lot of good scenes, some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film. still, i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one. if this movie had a chance to be remade today, i'd highly recommend courtney cox and jason alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re-write the original script. courtney tops my lists of actresses who i believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses; although, i have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties allison or dorothy came after me, i'd go quietly !!
