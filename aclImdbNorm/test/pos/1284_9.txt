bill, jeremy theobald, is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet. bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people.<br /><br />bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway, metro, and follows them as if he were their shadow. maybe bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? maybe it's because it fills bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? or maybe it gives bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. <br /><br />one day bill follows cobb, alex haw, home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following cobb. bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. <br /><br />amazingly good low-budget movie made by christopher noland in 1998 before he hit it big in hollywood with his ground-breaking and original motion picture classic "momento" some two years later that has already become a major cult movie. <br /><br />"following" is actually a much better movie then "momento" because it's a conventional and easy to follow story. compared to "momento's" which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated. whats makes "following" so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it. the movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like "momento" did. "following" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues, that you'll ever see.<br /><br />made with an unbelievably small budget of $6,000.00, thats less then what most hollywood movies budgets out for coffee-breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over one hour, 71 minutes, long. hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of hollywood can learn a lot from chris noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't; make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars.
