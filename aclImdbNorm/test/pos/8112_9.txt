this film entered production before ww2 began, but was not released until it was well under way. with significant fascist-sympathy in the us, and chaplin himself being suspected as a communist sympathiser, the great dictator was a very courageous endeavour. such risks in film-making - thinly veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable today. imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the usa's foreign policy?<br /><br />this film is hilarious, poignant and tragic. the tragedy is that chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end, but it is already to late - for him and for us. a must see if you have any interest whatsoever in history, film-making, politics or sattire as an art-form.
