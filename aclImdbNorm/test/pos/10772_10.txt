when it comes to movies, i don't easily discriminate between crap, pure crap and masterpieces. i believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes. this movie ran slower than mystic river and harry potter 3 combined and i still managed to stay riveted to my seat. for me, it was the passion that eric bogosian put into his performance. it's extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it. bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single-man performances in modern cinema. i didn't have any respect for bogosian until the end of the film. the entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, it was the key that turned me around. this man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it. the corporate boys congratulated him on the performance. his blistering prose made even the slimiest one in the cavalcade shake his head in awe. it made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy don't matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world for that matter. stone may have been pushing some uber-liberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention. oliver stone is a minor master of the moody. the final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography i have seen in any film. stone artfully makes the dj booth feel like five-by-seven cell in a nineteenth century prison. visually speaking, it appears that bogosian's only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. he speaks and it doesn't speak back. it's a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success. stone and bogosian carved out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self. this man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it. the scene that made me realize his conundrum was when he was unwilling to his ex-wife back. he preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside. every story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts: man versus himself. 'talk radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping, and artful fashion. there are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer. i just leaned back and let my mind be grasped by this film and i loved it. it's unheralded, unseen, and it will never receive its due recognition. let's hope it stays that way because gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. it's a gem because i found it in the discount dvd bin at my local wal-mart store. for $5.50, it was worth the half-hour i spent digging trying to find it. i did and i got more than my money's worth. this is one of the best movies ever made and that is worth ten reasons alone. ten reasons give a score of ten.<br /><br />here ends my rant!
