this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that i've seen since it came back last year. there is a brilliant mix of amusement, fear and tenderness all mixed up which equals one amazing episode. the ood were brilliantly designed and i'm pretty sure there' going to be a lot of ood jokes in the next few weeks. i myself am guilty of that already.i particularly liked the way that we saw a different perspective of rose's and the doctor's relationship and the ending;well, it's the first time i have ever hidden behind a cushion! i cannot wait until next weeks episode to find how they get out of this mess.
