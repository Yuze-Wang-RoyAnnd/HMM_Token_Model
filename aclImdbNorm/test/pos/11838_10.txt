this 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of marion davies and a terrific performance by c. aubrey smith. smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his grown children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. one is american (davies), one english (ray milland who looks about 18), and one italian (nina quartero). there are some surprises as the plot moves along with ralph forbes(was has no appeal at all) falling for davies.<br /><br />davies and smith are just wonderful together and very touching. davies also gets to do a few dances and make a few "big" entrances. and of course davies is just gorgeous.<br /><br />halliwell hobbes, doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, guinn williams, edgar norton, and david torrence co-star. had they given out supporting oscar awards in 1931, smith might well have been nominated. he's just excellent in this this gem.
