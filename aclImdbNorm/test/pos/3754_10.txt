i remember seeing this film when i was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. i found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. one in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. they also bound him and shaved his private parts. this was all because he was unpopular. why was he unpopular? because he was bad at games. i have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular. to me, he is the type of person who would always be picked on because that's how children operate. popular children are popular because they are in some way 'cool'. popularity is a hard thing to define. so, even at the end when he is successful in his career it makes no difference & he is still left feeling tormented. i found the ending quite distressing as there was no resolution.
