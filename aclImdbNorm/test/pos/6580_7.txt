the problem i have as a finn is that most of the actors in this movie are in every finnish movie. i have a feeling that finland has only like five actors. i think that if you're not from finland you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty.<br /><br />this movie is about a dreadful chain of events that affects a few people quite harshly. alcoholism, cold climate and darkness may all be clich'es but they're still very real in todays finnish society. a lot of people in finland have depression, especially during winter.<br /><br />the tone of the movie is very melancholic. i enjoyed it and louhimes' directing was again very solid. i liked this movie a lot, only negative thing is that you see the same faces that you've seen over and over again.
