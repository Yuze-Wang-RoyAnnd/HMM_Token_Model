i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co. i had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. <br /><br />the idiots that put it down on production value don't get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. and never worked in one for sure. billy jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message.<br /><br />i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned.
