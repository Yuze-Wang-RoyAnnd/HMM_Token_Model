this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how luke and lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love sookie st. james! she is so awesome . and the show wouldn't be anywhere without michel. the whole show is dry humor, sarcasm, and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other....especially the gilmore girls.
