a truly scary film. happening across curmudgeon james kunstler's rants led me to recently-formed web logs like life after the oil crash (latoc), energy bulletin, and the oil drum, and the data behind the theory of hubbert's peak. like this film, latoc and kunstler paint a grim picture of die-off or die-back. i hope they're premature, but in mid-2005 rising gasoline prices, rising oil prices, chevron's will you join us campaign, bp becoming beyond petroleum and even t boone pickens lend credence to the idea that we are at or near a peak of oil production.<br /><br />after copious research of limited data, oil investment banker matt simmons has suggested that the saudis may no longer be able to increase production in their immense, but aging fields. in the face of increased demand (primarily from the us and china), the saudis have not responded with higher production, despite previous assurances. stated world production from 2000 and 2004 indicates that light, sweet crude has indeed peaked. which means that refining will become more costly.<br /><br />the film seems aimed at baby boomers, but younger people, our children, also need to understand the implications of an energy-depleted future.
