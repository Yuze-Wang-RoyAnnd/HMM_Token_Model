i saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago. compared to the made for lifetime movies i usually watched, it became an instant though obscure favorite.<br /><br />i've seen it maybe twice since then. i think some parts are little cheesy, maybe the plot could use some more action.<br /><br />nevertheless, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. the magical realism is on par with that of amelie, and the heart with that of the wonder years. despite the particular development of my tastes, i still find the subtle magic of this film, the lovable characters, and its simplicity enchanting.
