this is a 1972 disney movie. for the time, i was eleven years old and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. feeling nostalgic, i purchased the three series dvd's of the dexter riley movies and even now, at age 46, i still enjoyed them. it was all about fantasy, magic, and clean fun. and it still is! i wasn't sure which of the three movies came first then second and last. so now i have the official dates. on december 31, 1969 the computer wore tennis shoes--on july 12, 1972 now you see him now you don't--on february 6, 1975 the strongest man in the world. i still think the middle movie was the best. the special effects were amazing back in 1972 to us kids. i definitely recommend it to all ages.
