obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but i think this one is done quite well.<br /><br />it's twistedly cute clever & dark. this story brought back memories of the types of girls i was in love with as a child.<br /><br />also, it makes me want to check out some of nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. <br /><br />sure there is some burton influence here, but i wouldn't say this brad is trying to rip him off.<br /><br />he is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that i can appreciate. i like what he does & he does it well, nuff said!
