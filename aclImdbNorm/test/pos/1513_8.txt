"un gatto nel cervello"/"cat in the brain" is one of the goriest horror movies ever made.there is a lot of blood and gore,including chainsaw butchery,bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations.the film is also interesting as "self parody" of fulci,but the gore and violence is the key element in it.some of the gore fx were taken from own fulci's movies "quando alice ruppe lo specchio" and "i fantasmi di sodoma"(both 1988),plus gore fx taken from fulci-supervised "the snake house" aka "bloody psycho" by leandro lucchetti,"massacre" by andrea bianchi,"non avere paura della zia marta" by mario bianchi,"non si sevizia i bambini" by giovanni simonelli and "luna di sangue" aka "fuga dalla morte" by enzo milioni(all 1989).the scene where brett halsey beats the woman's face to pulp is from "quando alice ruppe lo specchio",a film fulci had made for italian tv in 1988.the chainsawing of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film,as is the head in the microwave and the guy that gets driven over and over again.highly recommended,especially if you like extreme cinema!
