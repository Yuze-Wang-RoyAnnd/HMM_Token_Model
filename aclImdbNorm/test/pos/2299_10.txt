after having spent a lot of my youth watching such movies, i found this one very easy to follow in both the unedited and cut versions, (although the story has much more to hold it together in the unedited version. unlike ninja scroll this movie hit a much more serious note and i think that's where it hit me. the animation while grainy is very original, and i just love the way artists in that year stressed shadows to show different emotions. i think the story is perfect. the beginning of the movie really hits hard and as the movie progresses you get the feeling that you're going along in this adventure with the characters. as they meet, become allies and find out the their greatest strengths, a lot of heart was put into this.
