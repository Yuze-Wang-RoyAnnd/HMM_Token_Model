the captain and tennille have released a very good 3 dvd package with minimal editing. unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been hacked to bits. the musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast. i suspect that some musical numbers on the dvd may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to verify that suspicion. i've noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the dvd and program information i've found on the net. i've been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd. whatever the truth may be, i'm very appreciative of the efforts made by the production company. i wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format. i would guess about half the shows broadcast are included. i believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which weren't included. hopefully those issues can be resolved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. there are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras. i recommend this dvd to any c&t fan.
