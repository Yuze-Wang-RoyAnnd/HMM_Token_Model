i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein. carradine is much more passable & his acting isn't as ridiculous & overboard as in hof. the actors deliver solid enough performances. the subplots (eg the monster, the village mobsters, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse etc ) are mixed in well, so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof. better run than the stitched-together hof. the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof. the doctor is very good. as well, lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman. worth watching twice. a classic universal horror with that typical 1940's, long lost flair. especially good is the doctor's performance before/after his blood had been contaminated with dracula's.
