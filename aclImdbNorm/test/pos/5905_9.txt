don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds "mon oncle antoine," because like the best of canadian films darkness lurks just below the surface. <br /><br />set presumably in 1940s rural quebec, the story explores the developing consciousness of young benoit as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death. <br /><br />the look of the film is astonishing, especially seeing as a high proportion of criticism towards canadian cinema by the general public surrounds aesthetics. beyond this, the unassuming benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience, looking at his corrupting community with fresh an innocent eyes. <br /><br />i recommend reading jim leach's critical essay on the film in canada's best features for anyone looking to place the film into a historical context while also dissecting the form of the film. definitely check this one out.
