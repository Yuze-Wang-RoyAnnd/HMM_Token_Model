nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account other barker's movies, which never lack originality. an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. for the horror genre, it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references. certainly a lot of fun to have, a a bit to think about, if one cares to. and, not to forget, a nice music score. well, the special effects, as usual, get old faster than anything, but that is probably the only drawback. i've just seen it again after ten years, and i still find it something to recommend.
