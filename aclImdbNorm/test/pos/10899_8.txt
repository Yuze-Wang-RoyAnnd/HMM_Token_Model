"lonely among us" definitely is one of the best first season episodes. the storyline, although somewhat confusing, creates a lot of suspense, supported by the creepy synthesizer-driven soundtrack. this is a typically "alien body invasion" scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose (the death of assistant chief engineer singh to me was an accident). the two delegate species deliver an entertaining frame (best make-up so far) finally adding a little black humor to the series (the final scene). patrick stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his picard character and exploring some new terrain as does data by posing as sherlock holmes (another all time classic). the special effects are also convincing and director cliff bole did his job well. he is the first one trying to compensate trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks. she does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her appearance a lot. picard's "lightning-scene" on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of star wars "return of the jedi" (which is a personal impression but made me smile).<br /><br />there's also some playing with the lighting of the corridors (simulating night aboard) and the first moving camera, pulling back from picard when he's entering the transporter room to beam into the cloud... nice work. the clever cutting, creating continuing dialog through different scenes (troi's hypnosis report) rounds up the impression of a really well crafted tng episode. the first one, where even wesley crusher seemed almost tolerable... <br /><br />the ending however is a bit confusing, just as if the producers were running out of time. "p for picard" is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer...
