when i was younger, this movie always aired on friday night in the summer on channel 40 (this was the years before fox was a network and took over the programming). i always looked forward to it. i'd go grocery shopping with my parents, then sit down with my swanson's tv dinner and a lady lee cola(the only time of the week i was allowed to drink cola, and enjoy. sure, the script is predictably late 70's (like little darlings), but it's a fun movie, and i loved rudy and tripper. bill murray coasts with little effort in the movie, but he is charming. gotta love spaz and those taped glasses (pre revenge of the nerds). chris makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in "my bodyguard" but he does it so well.
