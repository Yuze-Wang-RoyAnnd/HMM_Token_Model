although i haven't seen it yet, i know that chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about hitler. all great satire is based on going out on an edge. also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. this film seems like it will skirt both sides. like kubrick's dr. strangelove, the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. and hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. another film that does this that comes to my mind is emir kusturica's underground, and fando and lis. so, let me watch the film first.
