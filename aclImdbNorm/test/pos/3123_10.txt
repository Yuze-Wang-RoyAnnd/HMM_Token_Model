i don't think i really have any spoilers in here but since i do describe a couple of funny scenes, i'll check the box saying 'might contain spoilers' just to be on the safe side. now...<br /><br />i hardly know where to start. by now you know the basic outline of the story - horse traders travis (ben johnson) and sandy (harry carey jr.) take the job of guiding a mormon wagon train west to their 'promised land' and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters, most notably the outlaw clegg family.<br /><br />anyone can enjoy this movie. you don't have to be a fan of westerns to like this one. for one thing, johnson and carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie. carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while johnson is a little calmer and wiser, kind of like an older-brother figure. i get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their 'gentle horses' for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you might say failings"... travis elbows sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle. the look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless.<br /><br />pay attention to the music... even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the sons of the pioneers, listen to "shadows in the dust" as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons. it's a truly beautiful song- too bad only half a minute or so of it is in the movie. i want to hear the whole thing sometime.<br /><br />one thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays. teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, straining to make the top - this was no simple and easy film. it must have been risky for the actors, the stunt people and the animals as well. fording rivers too, this movie has plenty of authentic-looking action involving the movement of the wagon train. it should be mentioned that both harry carey jr. and ben johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years' experience riding, roping, and doing all manner of cowboy-type things. carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many navaho indians and in fact he learned to speak navaho before he learned to speak english. no rhinestone cowboys in this movie - "travis" and "sandy" were the real thing through and through.<br /><br />watch for the scene when miss denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon, hitting travis's horse in the face... the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing him off it. watch the look on sandy's face when denver tells travis 'i'm sorry you fell off your horse.' another favorite scene of mine is when harry carey jr. (sandy) gets into a bit of a tiff with one of the mormons. they're working back to back getting their gear ready, and after sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow, the two of them get into a rear-end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling-around-on-the-ground fist fight. even after the elder (ward bond) stands them up and separates them, the two combatants continue trying to get at each other. the mormon (named 'jackson' in the film) gets one final kick in at sandy so high it hits his shoulder. it's a really funny scene from start to finish. <br /><br />i don't know what else i can say about this movie other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama. oh, it has been colorized, at least in the version i saw; not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see but i think i prefer it to black and white. i give this one a ten and i don't give out many 10's. one of my favorite movies, without a doubt. and, judging by the other comments, i have plenty of company in that assessment.
