this is a wonderful movie, and i still love it! it just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! i recommend it to people of all ages. i promise you will not be disappointed! the characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! the story of gerda and kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.<br /><br />i don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, i mean the movie was amazing! i haven't even read the book, and guess what? i don't care. in fact, if the movie and book are so different, then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it.<br /><br />i thought the acting was bloody brilliant! bridget fonda plays the snow queen, so evil, and so cold - you just have to hate her. chelsea hobbs plays gerda, a love-struck girl who is determined to find her love no matter what it takes, and goes on a wonderful adventure. and i just love all of the snow queen's sisters (the spring witch, the summer princess, and autumn robber)they are so fun and different in many ways.<br /><br />i haven't seen this movie in awhile, so forgive me if i make a minor mistake.... but there's no doubt that i will always love this movie.
