in one of the many bugs bunny-daffy duck cartoons, elmer fudd is out hunting, and daffy tries to get him to shoot bugs. needless to say, bugs has his own agenda. moreover, "rabbit seasoning" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).<br /><br />i think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by bugs and daffy. one of them seems like it would have been risqu'e for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did. all in all, this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.
