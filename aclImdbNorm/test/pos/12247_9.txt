typically, i'm a comedy guy. i rented this at the video store under comedy, and thought "albert brooks! awesome!" and rented it. it seemed like the romantic comedy, and i remembered i hated those, and had the full mindset of hating this movie.<br /><br />boy, was i wrong.<br /><br />while this is a romantic comedy, it's acted by an amazing lead & supporting cast (brooks, hunter, cusack, and nicholson), and everything works well within itself. the script sounds real and not forced, like this could be happening in the news station you're watching at night. it takes your emotions and makes you enjoy hunter and brooks and loathe hurt, which makes the ending a bit unenjoyable and fruitless, but it shows how you don't need a happy ending to end a movie, you just need a truthful ending, which is what everyone got. not everybody's life ends well, and it shows in broadcast news. maybe people don't like the ending because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies... but it works, it's real, and it's genius. broadcast news is a classic in it's time, and a fine romance movie up there with "casablanca". well, maybe not that high, but it's the only other romance i can think of that i like.<br /><br />broadcast news: 9/10.
