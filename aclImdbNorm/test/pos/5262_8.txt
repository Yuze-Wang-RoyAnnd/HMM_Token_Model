a terrific comedy-drama about the powers of friendship. despite it's a remake of a 1939 film of the same title, it would probably be compared to sex and the city. i would not compare to it totally. the story starts with mary(meg ryan) who seems to the life most women would envy, she's happily married, has a good daughter, great friends, and a great home. but marys perfect life isn't what it seems, when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with crystal(eve mendes) from zach's. mary is puzzled and doesn't know what to do. but her four good friends, sylvia(annette bening), edie(debra messing), and alex(jada pickett smith) try to be there for her in anyway they can. i really don't want to give anymore away. but i found this enjoyable, and i'm a man. meg ryan is great, it is nice to see her in on the screen again, after a series of flops. and the rest of the cast are also great including eve mendes as crystal. just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy.
