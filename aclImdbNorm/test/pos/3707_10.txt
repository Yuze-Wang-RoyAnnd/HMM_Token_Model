this film was made right in the area where i grew up and now live. i know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. as a teenager, i worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with ron perlman, jonathon furr, and the car. i am told that jonathon furr and ben allison are are natives of nc. i was fortunate to see it at a local showing. at that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 greyhound) used in the movie. the bus had no reverse gear and during filming, the driver missed his stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the proper point. those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me. the film accurately depicts life in this area during wwii. a well done film and i anxiously await the dvd availability.
