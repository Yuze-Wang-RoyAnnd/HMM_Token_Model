this is awesome!!! there is no partnership quite like errol, and olivia. there love is genuine! i'm 24, yet this flick is as captivating now as i'm sure it was 60 years ago. raoul walsh is an under-rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so broad, yet so intimate. the last scene between colonel custer (flynn), and his wife (de havilland), almost brought me to tears (not easy for a 24yr old guy!!), its so heart-wrenching. there is also a deep christian message implicit here, the faith custer has in taking your glory with you, and the trust, and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go, in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre. there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this. a must-see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american, and military history, from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. i knew errol flynn was a star, and de havilland was a screen legend-this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest!
