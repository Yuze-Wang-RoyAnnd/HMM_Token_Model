i have bought the complete season of surface. watched it in 3 days! i was so captured by the the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. the actor who plays miles is great. mile's sister, mother and father acted like real life family would. you could connect on so many levels it's fascinating.<br /><br />i find animals are so wonderful, you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child. it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists.<br /><br />am sadden, that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book.<br /><br />love the show very much. for those who haven't watched surface, if you like sci-fi you need to watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
