first off, i never got into dr. who until recently. honestly, i never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun intended) since it was never "big" here in the us as it is everywhere else.<br /><br />that said, i must say (obviously) that after finishing the 2nd season, that this is one of the best sci-fi shows i've ever seen.<br /><br />now, i watch a lot of sci-fi shows from all over and this show stands out.<br /><br />the first season was tops to begin with, with christopher eccleston in the title role and i thought he was terrific. of course, so was the lovely billie piper who just adds such humanity and warmth to the character of rose that no one could've done it better. let's not forget camile coduri as jackie and noel clarke as mickey/ricky who are just a blast to watch. then there's david tenannt. at first, i thought he was too gawky-looking to play the character (his ears!!), but after watching the 2nd season, he fits in just fine. his sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless. he's great with snappy dialog and can turn serious without batting an eye.<br /><br />aside from the great acting from the cast is the acting from most of the guest actors that have appeared. a lot of them are veteran actors but some are new to me and are damn fine.<br /><br />the production and direction of the show is top notch. occasionally, there'll be some cheesy effects here and there, but that's always been a factor in the original series and, like those episodes, is negligible.<br /><br />my favorite thing of all about the series: the stories. writing folks, is always the key to great entertainment. russell t. davies has written many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they have done an excellent job. they've managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialog. i also appreciate the fact that they can breach the older doctors' past story lines and enemies well (my friend explains much of this to me while we watch the show) and respectfully.<br /><br />i won't mention anything about the 2nd season and how it ends since the sci-fi channel just started airing the 2nd season.<br /><br />i wouldn't want to spoil it. it's so much fun and excitement. you'll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialog.<br /><br />it really is that good.<br /><br />ps: thanks to the producers for nicholas briggs back! **exterminate!**
