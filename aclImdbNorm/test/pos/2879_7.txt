this, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern b-movie. the dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable (there are a few decent twists) and characters remain 2d for most of it. and yet there is a certain...charm. wwe wrestler kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years) and so i'll find it quite amusing when people say it's "not much of a reach for him," but glen jacobs is, apparently, quite the nice guy, so actually it is. in any event, he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top (jason would be proud), but i heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest, oh it is quite the gorefest. the r-rating is richly deserved and i actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. in any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie.
