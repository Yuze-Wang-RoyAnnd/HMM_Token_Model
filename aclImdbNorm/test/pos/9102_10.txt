i absolutely loved every minute of this film. jack black and kyle gass most definitely brought the thunder in this epic tale of friendship, hard rocking and destiny.<br /><br />filled to the brim with unnecessary swearing in every sentence, toilet humour and the general rule breaking attitude, this movie is a must see for the hard core tenacious d fans of the world.<br /><br />we follow the journey of young jables (jack black) and kage (kyle gass) as they try and recover the pick of destiny, to win the open-mic night, and to become the greatest band on the planet. the duo have to overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers, a man with one leg and the devil to accomplish their task. i'll let you see whether they make it or not.<br /><br />the soundtrack itself is awesome enough, and now we see the d in person, making the experience even more magical. a must see for anyone who calls themselves a tenacious d fan. watch out for the inside jokes from the first album!
