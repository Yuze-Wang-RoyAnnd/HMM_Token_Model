ok, maybe it doesn't deserve an oscar. or a golden globe. or any award, for that matter. the acting isn't outstanding, there's no reason to give credits to the directing, and its really just another semi-gory 21st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent. or maybe even dreadful. but in my opinion, all of this doesn't matter a bit. and thats because i had a great time watching this movie.<br /><br />sure, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, something in it you will like, if you are like i was, and anybody else should be when watching this movie. and that is: looking for 2 hours of fun, mindless violence. (and a kick-ass ending, which i won't spoil.) yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you. hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a strip-tease that wasn't as nasty as anything an online pop-up would promise of her, but still not so unbearable as to fast-forward or turn off the dvd.<br /><br />the violence in this surprised me; nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about "these new movies called 'saw' and 'hostel'" but i could safely say that "wax" was more graphic than saw, and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing.<br /><br />in conclusion, i'm not surprised house of wax didn't make a place on the imdb top 250, but it is definitely worth a look.
