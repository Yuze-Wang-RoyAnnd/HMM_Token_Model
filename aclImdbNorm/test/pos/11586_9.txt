this movie tells about the real life story of ramon sampedro, who lived for 27 years lying in bed after having broken his neck, and fights a battle to get legal permission for someone that can assists with his death.<br /><br />javier bardem is one of best actors of his generation. consider this: he has to carry this movie with only his face! unbelievable that he didn't even got an oscar-nomination. now we can all see that the academy is a joke! the supporting cast was terrific! the optimistic rosa, his lawyer julia, the rest of the family...each and everyone has his/her own opinion about the fact that ramon wants to die.<br /><br />whether your for or against euthanasia, put your opinions aside, because this movie deserves to be seen by people all over the world! half way through the movie i started crying and it didn't stop until the credits rolled. this movie is so heartbreaking but also wonderful to watch and i can't wait to see it again. i give it a 9/10, and in my opinion it is by far the best film of the year so far.
