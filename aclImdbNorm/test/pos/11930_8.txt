picture this. someone makes a film about the columbine or virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone (i know this isn't but bare with me) and stars sean astin off of goonies!! picture the terrorists being overpowered by buckets of water on top of ajar doors and marbles and this is why you need to see the film. unfortunately it doesn't go all the way by actually having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil mexicans to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above 7 for that but not a 9 because it didn't go crazy enough. pity, its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness, well worth a cult status
