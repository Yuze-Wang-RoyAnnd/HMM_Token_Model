this movie was talked about in fangoria where i heard about this, it was interesting to me mostly becuase it was direct-to-video and i recognized two of the stars on the cover, james marsden of disturbing behavior and christine taylor from the craft. and to my surprise on valentine's day when i was searching through the horror aisle to find it on the shelf! i immediately had to grab it. me and my brother and our girlfriends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good, the tales were interesting and for once they were actually scary, unlike a lot of other horror movies being made recently. some of the plot i do not understand but once i watch it again i bet i'll get it. and to even more of my surprise there were other stars i recognized including one of the girls from the tv show my so-called life and jacinda from the real world, i'm not sure why this movie was only direct-to-video, with a little advertising this movie could have at least made up for how much money was spent on making it. the only problem i have is that since it wasn't released in theatres i guess i'll never be able to view it in widescreen. you should definitely take a chance and rent this one.<br /><br />
