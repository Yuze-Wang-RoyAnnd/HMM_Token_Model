tromeo and juliet (1996) is another jewel in the troma studios film archives. like the toxic avenger, troma's war, class of nuke 'em high, terror firmer and sgt. kabukiman n.y.p.d. this film is an instant troma classic. james gunn updates romeo and juliet taking a medieval tragedy and reinvision's it as a modern day street punk drama. if you have seen or read the play before nothing much has change except it has been "tromatized".<br /><br />lloyd kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the screenplay and makes it highly enjoyable film. the actors handle the script very well. i was surprised by how well they performed the dialog, a lot better than some hollywood big budgeted actors utilizing a monstrous budget and expensive sets. i enjoyed this movie very much. lloyd kaufman doesn't disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other troma productions. i would rather watch one of his films and be entertained than watch an boring expensive movie with pampered over paid actors, lame scripts, lazy directors and those awful c.g.i. special effects.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie. if you like fun films with cheesy special effects, over the top acting and inspired directing, then this movie's just for you!
