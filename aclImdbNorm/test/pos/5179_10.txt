seeing gary busey in a g rated film was a first and a nice one at that. i don't know much about the director, but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. where did jillian clare come from? my kids love her! the only thing i remember christopher atkins doing was blue lagoon. disney needs to see this film and put him to work. the wife thinks he is very cute. i liked what he did with his character. he seemed so real. what we liked most was the message this film sends out. greed sucks and faith, love and family wins! this is the first low-budget dvd we've bought that had so much stuff on it. the producers made this one for kids and the kids loved it. they liked the music and all the extras on the dvd. the director probably won't stick to family movies, but i hope he does - cause he really knows how to get the most out of kids, animals and stars like gary busey. the dog was great and seeing gary busey act like a dog was even funnier. there wasn't much we didn't like about this one. it hard to find a family film without all the crude humor, and quigley was a delightful surprise.
