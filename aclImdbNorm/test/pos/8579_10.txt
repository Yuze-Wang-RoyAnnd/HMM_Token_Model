this is a great movie. when two people from different backgrounds and social status think that they have nothing to offer each other and in the end they what each other needs it a testament to what the heart knows. sometimes we wonder why one man is with a woman or vise versa and the outward appearances say one thing to our eye, but what they offer each other from within that we cannot see is amazing and unexplainable. when nimi thought that matthew had nothing to offer her and when matthew was only looking for a fling (because he had an open marriage w/his wife jenny), in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without the other. it was worth it to them to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with each other. this movie kind of restores my faith in love.
