this film is probably the best new french film i've seen in this century so far. there have been some great ones including noe's irreversible, green's le pont des arts and hadzihalilovic's innocencebut none of them come close to les amants reguliers' timeless glory.<br /><br />the movie is a description of the events of may 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of, and a homage to, the nouvelle vague-movies of those days. concerning the depiction of the riots in paris the movie is meticulously accurate (i'm only 19 and i wasn't there myself but you know what i mean)and the almost real-time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of paris. the riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in bertolucci's the dreamers (to which the movie is comparable in many ways) instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent william lubtchansky. the love story that is the movie's main concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environment.<br /><br />this film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60's which makes the film all the more compelling. but the film is also a homage to the whole nouvelle vague canon. much of the dialogue evokes early truffaut, and the length and non-action and plot less structure is reminiscent of eustache or rivette. there are even godard-like verfremdung-effects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing bernardo bertolucci directly. this film is no doubt an answer song to bertolucci's the dreamers and it is also a nouvelle vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love story.<br /><br />bottom line: this movie is incredible and if you love french cinema you shouldn't sleep on it. it may be the finest french film since eustache's la mamain et la putain.
