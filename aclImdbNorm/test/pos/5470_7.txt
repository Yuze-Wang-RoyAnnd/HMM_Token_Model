and i would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for the seriously uneven irish accent of barbara hershey in the leading role of mother madalyn. the accent came and went unfortunately which i found more than a little distracting. <br /><br />however, the performance of william l petersen in the role of joad was outstanding, he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some periodic hokey dialogue. captivating and genuine, i found him quite astonishing in the way he captured the character. <br /><br />the premise of the film is fairly simple, the building of a forgotten staircase in a church. it is based, rather loosely i believe, on a true story and i had heard of this staircase prior to seeing the movie. <br /><br />it was a phenomenal engineering feat for its time - a floating double helix made without nails or screws. it exists to this day although it is now in private ownership.<br /><br />**minor spoiler**good supporting cast and barbara does dying so well in all her movies and here she doesn't disappoint. lots of special moments.<br /><br />7/10
