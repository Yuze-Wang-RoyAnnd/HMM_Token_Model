charlie chaplin's little tramp or little man character wins world war i, called the great war at the time, single handedly, even capturing the kaiser, something the entire allied armed forces were unable to do. too bad it all turns out to be a dream, which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short (almost a feature film at 46 minutes).<br /><br />there are inventive gags galore including charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat limburger cheese sent from home, then using the cheese as a weapon against the germans; charlie sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to annoy; charlie disguising himself as a tree--one of his best sketches ever--and charlie pretending to beat up his friend who has become a pow, then hugging him when the enemy is out of sight.<br /><br />one amazing feature is how much charlie, when he is behind enemy lines dressed as a german, resembles hitler over ten years before hitler and his nazi thugs rose to dominate german politics. obviously hitler patterned his appearance after charlie's from this film.
