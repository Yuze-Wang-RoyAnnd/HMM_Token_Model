i got a few laughs out of this one, more than a lot of other so called comedies. the big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of it's scenery was fun: as was getting to see some of dyan cannon's curves. this wasn't the height of lemmon's and mattheau's career, but it wasn't a total dog as some suggest.
