uproarious no-brainer comedy in which comedian mark blankfield portrays jekyll as an uptight doctor deeply committed to his research. once he's snorted his experimental formula, he's turned into the scenery-devouring hyde, causing no end of problems for everybody around him.<br /><br />i was pleasantly surprised by this one. it has a truly insane, madcap approach; it's full steam ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another. funny lines and sight gags are in abundance; blankfield plays each role for all it's worth. one highlight has hyde bursting into song; "hyde's got nothing to hyde" is quite catchy and even now i can still hear it in my head. the climax even goes so far as to spoof old b & w horror films.<br /><br />the supporting cast is quite spirited as well, with bess armstrong as the ditzy fianc'ee mary, krista errickson as the spunky ivy, and tim thomerson as flamboyant fellow doctor knute lanyon. i do wish more could have been done with thomersons' character, as i'm a fan of the man, but it's always nice to see him in something.<br /><br />a large array of familiar faces parade before the camera: cassandra "elvira" peterson, peter brocco, liz sheridan, george wendt, michael ensign, john dennis johnston, art la fleur, lin shaye, and george chakiris in a cameo as himself.<br /><br />it goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow, intelligent comedy, you'd better avoid this one at all costs. but for those who enjoy a zany, politically incorrect, gleefully raunchy good time, this just might do the trick.<br /><br />one of the best bits is saved for last.<br /><br />8/10
