ok. a warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. be careful about who you see this film with - ie - do not take kids to see this film. i'll explain why.<br /><br />1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - i assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf, but is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing. i have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a 'horror film'. but it is a very disturbing film ,and involves a child and his parents, and a small town.<br /><br />ok, it boils down to this. the film is not suitable for minors, because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child. is has a bizarre quality to it, and its only because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable. as a parent myself i feel strongly enough to want to tell people because i read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres.<br /><br />i hope im not offending the film makers by saying this, but i think its my right, because its getting a release, and has an m rating only.(because its not violent or sexual). just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself.
