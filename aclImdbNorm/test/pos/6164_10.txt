absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of flyable spitfires outside of a battle of britain reenactment. no less than eight flying spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences.<br /><br />those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty-eyed reciting high flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast, free and high in their dark blue world. be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. the core message is one that is shared by many war vets, in that their finest hours, their period of life when they felt most alive, was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray.<br /><br />the plot concerns czech pilots who escape from their country when the nazis invade and join the raf free czech squadron. there are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. this is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep the kleenex on hand). beautiful photography, first-rate acting, accurate details of raf life during the battle of britain. easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal dvd collection.
