what a great show! a very underrated dramatic show. it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character(s) are the main character(s).i think the best character on the show is vern schillinger. he is a tough, bad guy and an aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be. this show has many murders, i think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show, but i have to admit that is one of the reasons why i think the show is so great.i think some characters were killed off a little early, but some sure still made their mark. you can't compare things like prison break to this show, they are totally different. i think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them. a great show, my favorite's. a show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come.
