having read all of sarah waters books i was eagerly looking forward to a bbc adaptation of fingersmith. especially since tipping the velvet had been done so well by old familiar andrew davies.<br /><br />i was not disappointed with the results, in fact i think this might be on a par with ttv; both romantic and entertaining. and not as so many ignorant people would have you believe, a pointless lesbian romp. having been a fan of elaine cassidy's since seeing her guileless turn in felicia's journey i thought she embodied both hard deception and a growing fragility as maud. her transformation was believable and impressive to watch. i recognised sally hawkins as zena blake from tipping the velvet, a small role primarily so i didn't have as many expectations but she was astounding in the role of sue trinder. her eyes were mesmerising conveying everything from rage to absolute despair. the two of them acting together, combining these talents made this drama unmissable. of course imelda staunton was amazing as usual, she is unmistakably a national treasure and the supporting cast were all of a high standard. even the direction from the fairly unknown aisling walsh used contrasting yet beautiful shades of blue for briar and brown for london.<br /><br />however as much praise must be given to ransley the script writer. to turn a 600 page book where every line is of the highest quality into a three hour extravaganza is a huge feat. he illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace whilst giving us plenty of back-story and character development at the same time. he has my full admiration.<br /><br />in conclusion, a brilliant adaptation where all involved gave 100% and making this one of the best bbc dramas i've seen.
