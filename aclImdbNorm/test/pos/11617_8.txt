"subconscious cruelty" has to be one of the most disturbing films i've ever seen. "salo" and "cannibal holocaust" didn't bother me that much, but there's a strange psychological element to "subconscious cruelty". this film invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surrealist visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs. repulsive at times; yes, but its visual flair can be compared to avant gard directors such as alejandro jodorowsky, dario argento, dusan makavejev and david lynch. take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a film by luico fulci, and you might be able to guess what you're in for. <br /><br />the film is divided into 4 parts. the first part "the ovarian eye" is real short. a narrator tells us about the the parts of the brain and its functions. then a nude woman gets her stomach cut open and an eyeball is pulled out. the second part "human larvae" is kind of like the film "eraserhead" but with incest. it deals with a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. where's frued when you need him? the third part is my absolute favorite. it reminds me of "begotten" and jame's broughton's 1972 short film "dreamwood". in this segment people have sex with the earth. men hump bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. the branches bleed when broken. watch in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a woman's vagina. these people really know how to get in touch with nature.<br /><br />the last part of the film is the most disturbing and at times it borders on hardcore pornography. this part of the film made me think of jodorowsky's "the holy mountain", "sweet movie" and "cannibal holocaust". i've never been more disturbed in my life by what i witnessed. a business man gets his privates pulled apart by fishhooks. yuck and ouch! two women urinate on a christ figure and proceed to cannibalistically eat him like communion bread and sodomize him with a tree branch. poor guy. the last part was so extreme that if i ever watch the film again, i'll have close my eyes or slightly fast forward. karim hussien and mitch davis are obviously very talented, to think they did this project in there early 20's. hussein went on to direct the tarkovsky influenced "ascension" (2002) which is a much better film and he co-write the screenplay for nacho cerda's after dark horror masterpiece "the abandoned". "subconscious cruelty" is a fascinating and unsettling journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. well, sort of.
