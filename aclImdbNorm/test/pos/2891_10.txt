i purchased this dvd recently and i was totally awed that rush's songs sound the same as they did when i first listened to them in 1980. the lineup of geddy lee, alex lifeson and neil peart is so talented that i want to listed to them play again and again.<br /><br />songs i remember like tom sawyer, xyz, the big money, the trees, freewill, closer to the heart, 2112, limelight, and the spirit of radio were played and the 40000 plus fans there singing along and having a great time and i swear over half the audience was under 25!<br /><br />writers who put down rush as far as rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco.<br /><br />rush doesn't put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync,wear lipstick, get in trouble with the law, and have a band member brag about how long they have been unmarried. all they do is entertain!<br /><br />i give this dvd a 100 out of 100.
