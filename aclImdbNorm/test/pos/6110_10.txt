after watching desperate living, i was hooked on john waters films. i heard about pink flamingos and had to watch it and boy was it worth it! believe what you hear, it is trash! it is packed with everything filthy which is actually the main plot of this film. it contains the following: incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken shagging,nudity (like you never seen before- beware of baby's birthday party entertainers),poo eating,arson, trailer trash, perversion, transexuality, egg fettish, cross dressing...... you get the picture. above all, this is a definite must! just beware of the birthday party entertainer and divine wondering around the park!
