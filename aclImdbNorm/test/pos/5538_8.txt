i just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isn't funny or that it's boring. <br /><br />here's the trick --- the film is not meant to be just a comedy. it's got some depth to it. like many demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves. <br /><br />unfortunately, the movie and home video industries don't deal well with subtlety and drop this in the "comedy" bin. it is funny, but a lot of the humor is off-beat. however, the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it.<br /><br />it may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining. <br /><br />and the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself. michelle pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty. mercedes ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can, in a role which requires it. throw in oliver platt, joan cusack in smaller roles and the talented dean stockwell ... and even chris isaak and you've got a great cast throughout which here, as usual, makes a great difference.<br /><br />matthew modine is fun, but more important, he's a major hottie in this movie. hot, cute and sexy.<br /><br />sit back, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time.
