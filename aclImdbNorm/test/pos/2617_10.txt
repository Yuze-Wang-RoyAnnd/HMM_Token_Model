piper, prue and phoebe bring dr. griffiths to the manor in order to try and save him from the source's personal assassin, shax. whilst phoebe looks in the book of shadows for a spell to vanquish shax, prue and piper are attacked by shax and chase him into the street. unbeknownst to prue and piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. with phoebe in the underworld, prue, piper, and leo must find a way to reverse the damage done. leo goes down to phoebe, and tells her that the charmed ones have been exposed as witches. on the surface, piper is shot by a manic witch-wannabe, and prue has to take her to the hospital. the problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. so prue has to use her magic on the crowd, and they go to the hospital. piper is pronounced dead, and a swat team moves in. leo learns of piper's death, and goes down to tell phoebe. cole is asked to ask the source to reset time, and the source agrees; only if phoebe turns to the dark side. phoebe agrees, but the deal will shatter them. up on the surface, prue and piper are battling shax. prue shouts out for phoebe, who unbeknownst to them is in the underworld. shax throws piper and prue through a wall, and dr. griffiths out of a window. prue is not pronounced dead until the season 4 premiere episode, "charmed again, part one".<br /><br />"all hell breaks loose" is a gripping episode, and it made me sit on the edge of my seat. sad that prue's dead, but happy that there will be five more seasons of charmed. my vote; 10 out of 10. excellent
