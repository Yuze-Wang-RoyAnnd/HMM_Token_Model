one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with "only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance/adventure holywood movies...," as if those weren't reason enough to love it! anyone who, after seeing this movie, complains about connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, or the realism of the political motivations, or any other extra-movie concerns, simply doesn't love movies. see it and be awed by the star-power of the two leads, the exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film. this is proof that hollywood can "make 'em like they used to" when it really wants to. a solid 8/10.
