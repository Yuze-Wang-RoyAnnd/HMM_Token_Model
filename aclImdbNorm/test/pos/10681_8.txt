journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun which shares the same orbit as earth and therefore has been undiscovered until a space probe on the far side of the sun photographs it. of course two astronauts (roy thinnes & ian hendry) are sent to explore it but due to a malfunction they crash & find themselves back on earth only 3 weeks into their six week journey. of course they're berated (at least thinnes is, hendry is gravely injured) and grilled and asked why they turned back on their mission but it's claimed that they didn't. until thinnes seems to notice a few very odd things about being back "home". this is excellent if somewhat talky at times, and the sets and feel aren't a far cry from "thunderbirds" territory but will live actors for once. it's no big "star wars" type production but more quiet science fiction that one has to think about a bit. well worth seeing and it's criminal that the dvd is out of print. 8 out of 10.
