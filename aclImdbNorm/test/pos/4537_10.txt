for only doing a few movies with his life the late great chris farley. farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in tommy boy, david spade. from the lame police academy 4 spade really has done good with his career in films. tommy boy is a classic and we will always remember chris farley when we watch it. from appearing on saturday night live to doing tommy boy, black sheep, beverley hills ninja, almost heroes, billy madison, and dirty work. i think chris farley had a short and successful career. tommy boy was his best in my case and i would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time. thank you chris farley.
