"rouge" is part of a trilogy, but very much stands on its own. it isn't a sequel of any sort. the very end, which i won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. <br /><br />this film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. both themes are loosely woven together in the story. the film is very much a puzzle, but the message is pretty straightforward: everything happens for a reason. love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. the title, "red" refers to the french flag, where red represents "fraternity," or brotherhood. the color dominates the visuals of the movie. i tend to think of it as representing love or passion, or the blood of life. it's great when a film allows the freedom to do that ;)
