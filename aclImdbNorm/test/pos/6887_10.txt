this program is a favorite of our family, and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons!!! the title of "promised land" is very apt, as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her! it's a "god bless america" type of program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, down-to-earth characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful scenery, and well-written humor and drama. it's a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit from--without worrying about bad language, "adult" themes, crudeness, violence, etc. we always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and can't wait to see each one all over again when they're finally released on dvd!
