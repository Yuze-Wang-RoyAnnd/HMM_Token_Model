it's a horror story alright. but perhaps not as you know it. the real monsters in this flick are humans. while the monsters, are human and prey. as weird as that may sound i see this as "monsters inc" for horror film fans.<br /><br />sure, the effects are of a std horror film, the monsters are there as in any monster based film, the gore is there as well, there even is a slasher in the shape of dr decker (played by david cronenberg; i see flash of cillian murphy as dr. jonathan crane in batman begins here - or is it the other way round?). and it is decker &c who are the bad guys. the monsters want mainly to mind their own business, warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided, wanting to join there society.<br /><br />by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters (and the dog) - not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes....
