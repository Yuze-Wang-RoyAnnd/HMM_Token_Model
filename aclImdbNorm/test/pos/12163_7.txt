after getting thrown out of their last job and finding employment scarce in the united kingdom, the six members of the wonder boys, better known as the crazy gang see an advertisement for employment in the gold strike town of red gulch in the yukon territory. it's from a newspaper clipping and on the back there's a story about chamberlain saying the country better be prepared for war. off they go to the yukon and the frozen limits.<br /><br />by the way, it's case of misplaced chamberlains. the clipping is forty years old and it refers to joe chamberlain and the boer war rather than neville in the current crisis. but that's typical of how things go for this crew. i can see stan laurel making the same mistake.<br /><br />of course when they get there it's a ghost town inhabited only by young jean kent and her grandfather moore marriott. he's getting on in years and is a bit touched in the head. marriott's got a gold mine that he's misplaced somewhere that he goes to in his sleep, that is when he's sleepwalking. the gang better help him find that mine or otherwise pretty ms. kent won't marry stalwart trapper anthony hulme, but rather saloon owner bernard lee, a fate worse than death.<br /><br />this was my first exposure to the crazy gang and i can see both why they were so acclaimed in the uk and why they never made any impact across the pond. the jokes come fast and furious and then were a number of things that the code in the usa just wouldn't allow. the jokes are also strictly topical british and a lot just wouldn't be gotten over here.<br /><br />the sight gags are universal, the final chase scene is worthy of anything that the marx brothers did in america. my suggestion is that if you watch the frozen limits, tape it if you have a working familiarity with british history and run it two or three times just to make sure you pick up everything. it will be worth it.
