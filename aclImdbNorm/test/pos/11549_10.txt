i've tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film, while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10. the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review, although a few have done that quite nicely already. this film is confusing, depressing, and doesn't have a happy ending. i still gave pola x a rating of 10, because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film. that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking. i've only seen two of carax's films: this one and mauvis sang. as with this film, i'm being somewhat pretentious when i call this one of carax's best films- but i am. carax has a minimalist style. if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring, then it would be best not to watch this. but pola x was less minimalist than mauvis sang, so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller- at least for my taste. i found it quite interesting and absorbing. the two lead roles did an excellent job acting. (i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister.) catherine d. is always great, but her role was not very large or significant in the story. but everyone did a fine job. i thought the cult stuff was great. it may have not been very believable, but that is due to its being rather abstract. there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. this is a very freudian psycho-thriller.
