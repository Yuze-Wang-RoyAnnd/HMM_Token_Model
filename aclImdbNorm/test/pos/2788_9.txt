as a former erasmus student i enjoyed this film very much. it was so realistic and funny. it really picked up the spirit that exists among erasmus students. i hope, many other students will follow this experience, too. however, i wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience. but at least one of my friends who has never gone on erasmus also enjoyed it very much. i give it 9 out of 10.
