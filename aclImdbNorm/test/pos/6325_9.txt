the episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bather washed up on the shore, a forlorn jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery. yep,this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end. jim does well to unravel what is, a priori, an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home. to be sure, the eventual explanation is a little far-fetched. why, for example, go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her and her companions out would've been as easy and left less of a trail. however, these niggles aside, it's a memorable trf episode full of invention, even if yet again jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious police dept. i mean to say, have the ungrateful so-and-so's ever sat down and counted just how many of their files have been solved by dear ol' jimbo?
