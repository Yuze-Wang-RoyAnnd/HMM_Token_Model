clever psychosexual drama about a wounded union soldier (clint eastwood) who seeks refuge in an isolated confederate school for young women during the civil war. slowly, eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight, until the tables are turned and he becomes the pursued in an unsettling, gothic-toned finale. never has a film been so deliciously erotic yet disturbingly macabre at the same time.<br /><br />this is undoubtedly eastwood's finest hour (those who tune in for "dirty harry" will indeed be surprised), while the rest of the cast gives uniformly superb performances. try to see the film on video, as television prints usually delete crucial flashback scenes between geraldine page and patrick culliton.
