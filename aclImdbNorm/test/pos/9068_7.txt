the story in this movie is fairly implausible b grade stuff, but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead, and in 1940, that meant peter lorre. and peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner stephen danel, who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine. upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of danel.<br /><br />only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves; danel's wife, and monkeys. monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get.<br /><br />lorre is perfect in his role here, and creeps up the screen in industrial-strength fashion. although the script is not casablanca caliber, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. this is a very watchable story, but i'm not sure what niche this movie filled. too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature length film, i'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters.<br /><br />i just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning tcm showing. lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it.
