two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to william s. burroughs, philip k. dick, and anime all at once. the robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to dicks blade runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for "heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal"....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films. the hilarious climax involves the two leads morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus for a head, who personifies "destruction", which has been the path of both characters thus far, their individual minds and later literal heads functioning as something like testicles. the film ends with the mayor f*&%ing his free jazz playing boy lackey as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them, the last words of the mayor "oh f*&%", followed by a quick fade to black. part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly i was just laughing. a lot of the film is quite boring though, the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow. takashi miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films, and this film with the exception of "gozu", reinforces this theme more than any other. sex and violence are two pretty basic themes, but like cronerberg(who the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala naked lunch)miike is able to show where the two connect, to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect.
