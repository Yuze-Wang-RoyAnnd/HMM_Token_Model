one of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed, quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice. the final sequence, with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb.<br /><br />no, what about the work of sean penn and susan sarandon? it leaves you breathless, they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion.<br /><br />tim robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor, he's a nice director as well.<br /><br />*my rate: 9/10
