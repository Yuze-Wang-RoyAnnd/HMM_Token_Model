again, i've read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones, but totally disagree with those who think it was/is hokum.<br /><br />personally, i think nuclear is about the only energy left to us, unless our governments (feds and states) increase the grants thinking homeowners will use photo-cells on their roofs. many attractive and pricey homes in southern calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around, the sun. i live in a loft, which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day. i hardly use the ac - i'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler. we are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. i'm from the gulf coast of the usa, so i know about humidity.......<br /><br />that said, i found "the china syndrome" to be a convincing movie about what could go wrong, if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants. i think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague: they are safe. tmi is still on-line....<br /><br />director james bridges carefully guides this plot (by mike gray-t s cook) to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film. all the roles were well-played: jane fonda ("kimberly wells"), jack lemmon (jack godell") and producer michael douglas ("richard adams") are all excellent in their roles, plus all of the rest of the cast. i, too, loved there being no score. it was so interesting to get a true-to-life glimpse of the behind-the-scenes of the tv industry - that shouldn't be surprising. currently, dan rather is sue-ing cbs, and i hope he wins. can you believe donald trump saying "he's a loser" ? trump - who cares? "tiberius1234" posted a very good comment here - i agree. it is my opinion that getting "vaporized" by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted, and becomes "blade runner" and/or "solyent green". come away from your video-games for a couple of hours and watch this "dated" movie (really isn't), and get a little education on nuclear energy. i recommend it to the whole family....
