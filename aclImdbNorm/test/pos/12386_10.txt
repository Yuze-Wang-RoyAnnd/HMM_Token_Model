okay, i'll say it. this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy. i mean, did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece? just look at the "scary" hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer. instead, like the original jack frost (which i thought was just as funny), this movie turned out to be a side-splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue, bad one liners and horrible special effects. and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. it certainly worked for me.<br /><br />for example: anne tiler (to her troubled husband): what makes you frown so heavily darling?<br /><br />if that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh, then you have serious issues. who in their right mind would utter those words in real life? of course, no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous! just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2.
