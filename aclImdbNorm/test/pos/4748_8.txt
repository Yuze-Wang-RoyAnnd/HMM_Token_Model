i recently got the seven-ups on video and i must say it was a very enjoyable movie. roy scheider and tony lo bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young richard lynch is great as psycho henchman moon. the late bill hickman is pretty good as his associate bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats. the other three members of the seven-ups team are pretty bland but that's only to be expected.<br /><br />i'm glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie. i think it should be a film that should be released on dvd and not just forgotten. i certainly enjoyed every minute of it. the final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions. the seven-ups does not disappoint.
