i have to agree with all the previous commenter's--this is simply the best of all frothy comedies, with bardot as sexy as marilyn monroe ever was, and definitely with a prettier face (maybe there's less mystique, but look how marilyn paid for that.) i don't think i've ever seen such a succulent-looking female on screen, so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited by it--and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if the idiot evangelicals really want to do their 'convert-a-queer' number, they are really going to need to up their standards, as no church mice need apply here...)her breasts, the rest of her figure, her adorable voice, the hilarious way she shakes as she walks across a room...only to arrive in front of a man, breasts literally pointed as if in exquisite confrontation...<br /><br />i think boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all of film history. no one played opposite more great female stars than did he: garbo, dietrich, k. hepburn, colbert, and here bardot, among many others. and he was also in 'fanny' with leslie caron, and had small parts in 'how to steal a million' with a. hepburn, as well as being in the deneuve movie 'the april fools' (although not opposite her.) the only thing i could disagree with in remarks is that even the loud, obnoxious music over the opening credits is appropriate--i mean, bardot is not meant to be subtle on top of everything else, and her essential loudness (i don't mean her voice) is part of her irresistible and, one might even say, exemplary charm.<br /><br />vidal is thoroughly handsome, even if pouty brigitte says toward the beginning 'i don't know why i am in love with you, you're not even handsome.' <br /><br />dear, dear bardot! truly one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us, when so many of the truly characterful are passing away so fast, in all her eccentric glory.
