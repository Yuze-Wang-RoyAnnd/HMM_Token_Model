yes, it is a bit cheesy. but it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters. it's interesting to see david soul in a 'bad guy' role; i thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid co. robert conrad is a long-time favorite--i think he brings his character to life very well; and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his i've watched--movies or tv. <br /><br />i watch this movie every so often but our tape (a vhs tv copy i got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it. this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but i'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version. i'll keep hoping!
