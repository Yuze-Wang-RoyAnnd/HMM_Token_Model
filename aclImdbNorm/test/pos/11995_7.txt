seriously. if this had been the first shack movie, it would have been passable as funny, silly and goofy. light satire commentary on the class system would make this an enjoyable late-night rental.<br /><br />however, everyone wants to compare it to the first film, and maybe that's not fair. the first film is a cult classic; what could possibly follow it up? nothing. so take this second film as a stand alone, and it certainly has its moments.<br /><br />jackie mason is amusing, doing his best rodney-wannabe impersonation. is he as good as rodney? no. are his lines as good? no. but he is funny. the rest of the cast falls in line as being decent, but not outstanding. you'll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they got to where they are today.<br /><br />the film is predictable, but aren't most in this genre? again, it's not the best comedy you'll see, but if you like cannonball run-type fun, you'll enjoy this one.
