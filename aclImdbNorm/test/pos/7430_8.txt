errol flynn had quite a gift for comedy that was sadly rarely exploited. given the right material this film demonstrates that he could have happily been quite at home in cary grant style, gentle comedies. out of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the best. patti brady gives a fine performance in the child part and eleanor parker looks simply stunning throughout the film. an added bonus is the wonderful hattie mcdaniel who is sadly underused in this film- a welcome presence none the less. flynn carries off his comedic duties with the same easy style that he brought to his swashbuckling roles. the fact that he makes it look like it's easy doesn't mean that it is. a super little family comedy, great for the christmas period or any other time you feel like being cheered up.
