i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago, when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema, which i found interesting, to put it diplomatically, but not so special, i instantly wanted to see more of his work. since then, i tried - with an emphasis on tried - watching his other work, shadows in particular. i must admit, it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film. at first the unpolished, raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot, put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original - absolutely - but flawed and dated experiment. but now, upon reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today.<br /><br />shot on a minimal budget of $40,000 with a skeleton six person crew, shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an african-american family in which two of the three siblings, ben (ben carruthers) and lelia (lelia goldoni), are light-skinned and able to pass for white. cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones. cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing, a reaction against 'seamless' hollywood production values. cassavetes main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style the film was shot - were the italian neo-realists whilst also professing admiration for welles' pioneering spirit. the use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neo-realist directors, but with his bebop score by charles mingus ans shafi hadi, the film feels very different, very american, unlike anything made before really. <br /><br />the song with the feathered girls, "i feel like a lolly-pop" (or something) feels like light years back to me, ancient history. but no matter how dated it might look, it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today. i think it's this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film, without hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. seymour cassel, who acted and was involved in shadows, claims it was jules dassin's the naked city (1948) that was the first and inspired them all, but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakers.<br /><br />camera obscura --- 8/10
