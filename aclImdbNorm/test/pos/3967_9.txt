diora baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. but really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch.<br /><br />(minor spoilers) as per usual, the main character, b, is the sane one of the bunch. b has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. he's known for making fake ids. so an acceptance letter is no problem.<br /><br />because b's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, b gets his friend sherman to design a website for the university. sherman has been accepted to a great college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud. he's very quick with witty lines but his flaw is he wants to be accepted socially too much.<br /><br />glen, hands, and rory are the three stooges that follow b along. glen got a zero on his sats and has no thought process. he's constantly proposing battle royals, but he's very good at making smoothies, which gets him a lot of hot girls, somehow. hands was a great football player who didn't receive the scholarship he was counting on, and turns to crafts to cover his lack of athletics. rory was preparing to go to yale since the 1st grade, and was not accepted. she spends her time meditating.<br /><br />uncle ben was my favorite character. picture lewis black playing himself. if you have no reason to see this movie, then see it for lewis black and jonah hill. they're amazing.<br /><br />monica is a b's love interest. as most of these stories go, she's more popular than him and doesn't even notice him until half way through the movie. unlike many other stories though, b actually gets her and keeps her until the end. monica is actually a good character on her own, but of course she's primarily there for b to adore.<br /><br />there are more supporting students at the made-up college who are fun to watch. a.d.d.'s name is self explanatory, and funny enough he ends up in the meditation class. kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls head over heels for a chance to go to school and eventually gets a crush on glen. maurice is an ex-military idiot who got his g.i. bill and wants to study rock n' roll in college. the final guy is only known as freaky student, who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. ye who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie.<br /><br />of course the villains are the dean of an opposing university, his university's student body president, the president's girlfriend, and their circle of friends.<br /><br />every character is lovable. i believe this movie has a good plot and is well done, despite what a lot of people say. even thought the overall story is predictable, the characters keep you guessing and make the movie great. go see this film. i give it 9 out of 10.
