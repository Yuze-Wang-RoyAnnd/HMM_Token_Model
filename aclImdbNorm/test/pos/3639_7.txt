i know gerrit. he presently lives in the u.s. this film is based on events in the lives of both gerrit and celeste wolfaardt. it's a remarkable story. it inspired me to read "cry, beloved country." the film is well-produced. the music is beautiful.<br /><br />the story is told in flashbacks. you learn the stories of a white racist south african (gerrit) and a black south african (moses). their lives intersect violently. the ending is not typical hollywood -- it's unusually realistic and ends on a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themes.<br /><br />be sure to watch through the credits -- you'll get to see footage of gerrit in real life.
