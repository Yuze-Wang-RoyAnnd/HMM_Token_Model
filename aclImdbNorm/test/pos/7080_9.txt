"one true thing" is a very quiet film, that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box-office. it tells the crippled story of ellen (renee zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (meryl streep), so that her aloof father (william hurt) can run his academic department. these terms are only general. the strength of "one true thing" lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above hollywood clich'e territory.<br /><br />streep is kate, the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating hurt's birthday. but ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from harvard university, has a certain destain about her- ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. while on the other hand, she admires her father- who shares a special passion: writing. ellen writes for an aggressive new york firm, and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by hurt, who seems to be a very lonely figure.<br /><br />to get to the point, as kate gets sicker, ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and ellen assumes he's having an affair. meanwhile she's given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's "cult" group the minnies, and also learning that her mother isn't as weak as she first assumed.<br /><br />without giving too much away, "one true thing" is a masterpiece in character study. streep once again turns in a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. streep earned her eleventh oscar nomination for this performance. hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn't revealed until the closing moments. but it is renee zellweger who steals this movie. forget "chicago", "cold mountain", "bridget jones's diary" or whatever else you've seen her do and rent this movie. she is remarkable in it. working within her character's bitter resentment at understanding her parents, zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while she's screaming inside.
