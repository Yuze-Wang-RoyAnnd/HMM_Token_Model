after getting hooked on the mini series, "north & south," i could hardly wait for the continuation, "north & south ii." then years later, along came book iii, "heaven & hell - north & south - book iii." finally, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the maine and hazard families. i was so enraptured by this series that i taped each part off of tv and then managed to get family and friends hooked and i watched it again, each time someone new wanted to see them. my tapes are old and i crave this trilogy on dvd. if you missed book iii, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out. do yourself a favor and demand this set on dvd!
