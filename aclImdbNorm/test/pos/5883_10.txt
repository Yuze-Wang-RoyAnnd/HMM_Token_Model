this film tells the stories of several couples coping with post-wwii life. through many moving accounts the audience learns how the war has changed people, while their human spirit went on to triumph.<br /><br />my favorite scene is where a young service man, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms up to the elbow) is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him. his girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn't be able to do, but that they would be fine together. moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his fianc'ee in tears.<br /><br />the scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. when he is initially refused as a "high risk", a higher ranking bank official takes over saying "you fought for our country and kept us safe--that's good enough for me. your loan is approved!" "the best years of our lives" won 6 oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living, even with a severe handicap. this film is a joy to watch over and over again. a true classic! highly recommended!
