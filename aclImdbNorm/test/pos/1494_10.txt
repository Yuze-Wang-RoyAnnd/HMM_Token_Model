...the last time i laughed this much. it's a testament to the talent of rowan atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. the whole success of the program rests on atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. at times exasperating, at times lovable, mr bean is an innocent, unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate. the brilliance of this character cannot be put into words, you have to see for yourself.<br /><br />the show gets almost too depressing at times, like in the infamous new year's eve sketch, or when bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant, offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself, and being served a stake he doesn't quite fancy. still, there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which bean gets himself out of trouble, like when he disposes of said stake in numerous clever-ish ways, or when he changes into swimming trunks without taking his trousers off first! whatever your reaction to bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you're bound to throw fits of laughter while watching. <br /><br />finally, i'd like to point out that although "bean" is classified as a program for children, it is just as enjoyable for any grown-up with a sense of humour. because the more "adult" jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) is funny no matter what age you are, "bean" is the truest definition of a family show. this is justly a classic and it always brightens up my day.
