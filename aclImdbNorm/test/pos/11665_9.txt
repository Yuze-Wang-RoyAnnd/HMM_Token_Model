"dead man walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. all the acting is top-notch and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides, paying equal homage to both. above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, of death with dignity and loss of ego. any film that deals this courageously and maturely with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10/10. thank you, tim robbins!
