i try to be diverse in my movie watching. i can get into "pride and prejudice" as easily as i get into "disappearing acts". love jones is my all time favorite, it is the standard by which i judge any modern urban romantic comedy. shot very well, the shot of nia and darius riding up lakeshore drive on the motorcycle is one of classic 3 second movie shots of all time. of course no one will ever remember it. when it came out, i though it would be a new paradigm for modern urban film-making, good actors, no guns, and so forth. the movie industry has disappointed me to a certain degree, you will have your occasional drumline, or roll bounce, or tyler perry's "why did i get married". so whenever i need to see "my people" presented on screen in a very professional and stylish way, i pop in love jones. there is no best movie ever made, to many people and opinions for that. but it is my personal best. my favorite line from love jones " baby, i just wanna come up and talk!!"
