the best years of our life is often compared to it's a wonderful life. they never should be. their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. it is hard to know what value individual life may have. (how many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? what a statistic we have to live with.) also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. we have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.<br /><br />i have been a life long pacifist. i oppose all war. not long ago i had that position tested. it occurred while i was on the uss lexington, which is permanently anchored in corpus christi, texas. the ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which i live. it is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. she had seen a great deal of action. someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.<br /><br />i cannot watch the best years of our life without thinking about things like the lexington.<br /><br />each of the three veterans paid their dues. and they paid mine as well.<br /><br />no one of them got off any easier than any other. the navy, air force and army paid equally although in different ways. each had problems directly related to the war. and each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. it took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.<br /><br />the moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. the obvious case is when derry told herald to marry the girl. don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. it is hard for harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. but to his credit, harold listens.<br /><br />the other is when al tells derry to stay away from his daughter. the meaning was clear. mend your relationship with your wife
