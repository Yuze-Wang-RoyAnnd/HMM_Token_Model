born in 1946 i was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression.not only scary ,for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years.the mob goon played by john larch was terrifying.the only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a "little n----- kid".those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on tv,maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene.accurate or not the film went a long way in formulating my opinion of the south and still till today the closest i've come to visiting a southern city is el paso.that stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story.when the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years.with the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact.the film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility.the terror in the movie isn't provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time.re killing of little girl:the recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mind.when this movie came out the only school i had ever gone to was attended by mostly african-americans.the victim looked like a girl in my class,it was like seeing an actual killing.it made a horrible scene that much worse.maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me.
