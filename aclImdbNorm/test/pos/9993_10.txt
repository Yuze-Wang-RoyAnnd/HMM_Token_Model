if you watch this at home on dvd or bluray! be sure you have great sound system. the musical score through this is what moves you through the movie. i have watched the movie several times and thought it was great but after just up-grading my home theater sound system, what a difference. i will be watching this movie many, many more times.<br /><br />if you do not have a great sound system. find a friend who does and watch it there.<br /><br />also watch the extra stories and behind the scenes extras that come with it (the br or dvd.) the interview of quimet in the 1960's talks about his scholarship fund...but for those times just boys got it. today i hope some of it goes to girls.......
