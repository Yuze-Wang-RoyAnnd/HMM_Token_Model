john carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of sci-fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. a remake of the howard hawks produced 1951 original, carpenter keeps the cold-war themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the antarctic setting. carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. but here and much like the work of david cronenberg, carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. however, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.<br /><br />9/10
