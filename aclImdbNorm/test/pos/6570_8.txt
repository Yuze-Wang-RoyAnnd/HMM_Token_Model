a town in japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape: the spiral. it's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them, mentally and literally. this film shows it happening to several groups of people. some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge. the film progresses really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (walking dead).<br /><br />as a jaded american horror movie fan, this was just what i needed. maybe it was just the novelty of a different culture's film, but it seemed to have a very original progression, set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. the japanese may think "horror shapes" (uzumaki means "spiral," i'm told) are old by now, but it was nice for me because i'm used to monster/alien/virus/disaster/undead films. in an american movie, you know who's going to die (the annoying/nasty/lascivious/racist characters) and who will live (the children/heroine/dogs/cats/nice guy). that's not true in japanese horror. it was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up. also, it had this really new (but probably typically japanese) color leached pacific northwest style cloudy day thing going, which was a fresh visual effect for me. the horrific moments were seriously creepy, relying on a little gore but mainly just impossibly overdone facial expressions (think the ring) and body manipulations. this should be one of the greats, up there with once-original ideas like the first nightmare on elm street or night of the living dead.
