back in 1983, michael jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $1 million horror music video with the "american werewolf" team and featuring the voice of vincent price, then that was exactly what he was going to do. and never has a music video created such a sensation, before or since ... when it was released on vhs, this 13-minute short became the world's largest selling musical of all time. but odds are you already know all about it, as whenever there's a list of the greatest music videos of all time, this one almost invariably takes the top spot.<br /><br />it begins with michael jackson walking down a dark street with his date after their car has broken down. he explains to her that he's "not like other men" (damn right), and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds. his girlfriend stands there and screams, and screams, and then screams some more, during a lavish transformation sequence as michael jackson becomes a werewolf. he chases her through the forest, catches her and we ... cut to a movie theatre. ah, all of this is just occurring in a horror movie that michael jackson and his date are watching.<br /><br />so, we're five minutes in and still no sign of the song "thriller". extravagant, much? anyway, you must know how it goes from here ... dancing, singing ... graveyard ... vincent price ... zombies ... "what's the problem?" ... then end credits. end credits for a friggin' music video. "thriller" isn't one of michael jackon's most memorable songs, but even by today's standards it sure is a bitch of a visual experience. if you still haven't seen it in it's entirety, then you definitely should someday soon.
