well,i'm not a movie critic or something like that.but i have my opinion for this movie.i think that the best in this movie was amanda bynes,she played her roll for my look very well,i have watched many her movies,this i liked most!when you are watching this movie,you just can relax,come down,and watch it.you don't have to try to look for subtext or something like that.you just watch it. movie is really great. maybe i liked it for actress,maybe for all the scenery,but i liked it.the whole atmosphere that was created.in one moment i just felt like i was in that university,in that room.it is not another drama movie that is made to win oscar,it is just nice movie to watch in your free time.
