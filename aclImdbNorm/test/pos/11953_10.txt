i really love anything done by savage steve holland, the writer/director of this great movie. also see "better off dead" and "how i got into college." wonderful! anyway this movie is really humorous and delivers some unexpected things. where else but in this movie can you see demi moore as a talented singer and bobcat golthwait as a twin? i recommend this to anybody looking for some old fashioned slapstick comedy (george with the turtle raft), not to mention some really well written sarcasm (the christmas tree on the roof of the car). this movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after you've seen it 100 times like i have! enjoy!
