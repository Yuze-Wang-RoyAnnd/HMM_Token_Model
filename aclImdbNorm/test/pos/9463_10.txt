ok, now at first i thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic comedy, which held back on the comedy but this wasn't. i mean how could it have been with the fabulous amanda bynes staring in it! she was amazing, really funny & is still stunning! the boys in it were also extremely fit, one major reason for going girls! the plot is strongly based upon the shakespeare play 'twelfth night', as it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to the malvolio like character. the script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty. the football skills in it were also amazing, it even made me think of playing football myself! anyway, to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance, which gets very confusing! go and see it!
