sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with blackbeard (mr thomas gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. with fifty years of hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m.tourneur or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time. it was an exciting,entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions,hidden meanings or alternative agenda.it was fun. m.louis jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest. mr herbert chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor.mr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun. but it is miss peters who stays in the memory.wilfully adolescent,illiterate,tough but vulnerable,wonderfully agile,and ultimately,courageous,she is everybody's idea of a lady pirate. there was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles - that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret.
