let's not beat about the bush here, taylor hackford's undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than jamie foxx's exceptional, career-making performance. remember the year they handed the special effects oscar to the terminator 2 boffins, uncontested? they should do the same with this year's best actor gong.<br /><br />that ray charles' story is worthy of filming is not in dispute. indeed, the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well-handled and judiciously used. but for a life so unique, the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar. it follows the 'history of a flawed genius' template almost to the letter: hardship and exploitation, women and drugs, recording wrangles, band squabbles, rehab, yeah yeah yeah. and surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here?<br /><br />i appreciate charles' music yet where neatly-cut medleys would have kept the story rolling, hackford indulges himself with near-full-length renditions of too many songs - in gin joints, in the recording studio, in concert halls, infinitum. narratively, and for non-devotees, they begin to act like a cinematic brake. this may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a catalogue as extensive as ray's, we need a taste not the whole dish. otherwise, we'd buy the albums.<br /><br />intrigued as i was, i glanced at my watch more than once. so for all foxx's brilliance, maybe ray would have been better served as an hbo two-parter?
