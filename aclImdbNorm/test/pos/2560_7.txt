better than i expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. the music is great, and cinematography focuses greatly on turning ricci into a trailer trash betty paige and it works. samuel l. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, as well as play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool doing. even justin timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. i get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%#, but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.
