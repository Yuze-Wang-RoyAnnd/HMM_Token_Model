very good "precoder" starring dick barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of hawks' "only angels have wings" (1939), in which barthelmess also acted. this film was directed by masterful william wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation silent picture "wings".<br /><br />barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. afterwards he meets and falls for pretty sally eilers, who participates as part of an act in an itinerant air circus; but when barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues.<br /><br />"central airport" has many thrilling moments and some moving and touching scenes too, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between barthelmess and eilers (who, in my opinion, in this film resembles very much actress dorothy mackaill). tom brown is good as barthelmess brother, fresh from his success in wyler's "tom brown of culver".<br /><br />great special effects, good flying stunts, swiftly paced film; in all, highly entertaining. don't miss it when tcm airs it again.
