when i saw the first preview for this, i nearly passed out from excitement. i have long been a fan of twelfth night- it turned me on to shakespeare, so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true. my anticipation was not disappointed.<br /><br />the plot basically follows the original storyline and that means: complicated! i don't want to even try to relate it, the plot summery will probably cover the basics. just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create. i will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is not the point of the film.<br /><br />what it is, though, is absolutely hilarious. nearly every scene nails the comedic set-up. kudos to the writers, director and actors on that count.<br /><br />amanda bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully. she's super-cute, not a vixen and can do faultless comedy. i admire her so much for not going full-on tramp in her films or public life like so many starlets today do. i'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in hollywood. ok, i'm off my soap-box...<br /><br />channing tatum, yeah he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! my favourite scenes in the whole movie are when he's trying to converse with olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his workout regimen.<br /><br />the rest of the cast did not fail to perform either, with marvelous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane d'ebutante mother and monique, the classic evil girlfriend.<br /><br />overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughs, and a highly attractive cast. maybe not on par with the original, but it beats out modern versions of other plays, including the much-touted 10 things i hate about you.
