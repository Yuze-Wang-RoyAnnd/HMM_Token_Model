it's just that. chucky 1 was good. chucky 2 was better. chucky 3 sucked. now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. jennifer tilly was just great in this movie. for dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (freddie prince jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies i've seen in the past.<br /><br />the plot wasn't great, but i really didn't care about it. just to see chucky and tiffany bicker and fight each other. and the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel (which i hear is in the works). idle hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror/comedy, but i doubt it'll top this one.
