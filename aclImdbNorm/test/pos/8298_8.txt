i'm serious as well, i mean don't get me wrong, if you haven't got a bent for this type of z grade, creaky creature feature {why would you be watching is my first thought?} then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops, but to me it's a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood. you know the kind, the memories that never leave you. eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as doug mcclure and peter cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and sub-human species'. and guys,! now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of caroline munro and her heaving cleavage. no wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one!.<br /><br />yes the effects are bad, men in suits, strings pinging parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like thingies amuse us greatly. and yes, cushing and a surprisingly pudgy mcclure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil meyhas at the "core" of our film. but it matters not, zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour, at the earth's core is a throwback to a special pre-ilm time when kids like me queued around the block to see such joyous nonsense. 8/10
