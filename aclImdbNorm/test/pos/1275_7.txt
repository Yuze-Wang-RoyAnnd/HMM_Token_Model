this is definitely nolan's most intimite,and thought-provoking piece. not to say that memento or insomnia are bad,but they were definitely up to more hollywood standards...while following is more of an indie flick. the story is very brilliant,and very well developed. overall...watch this if your a fan of any of nolan's work,i'm sure you'll be able to appreciate it more.
