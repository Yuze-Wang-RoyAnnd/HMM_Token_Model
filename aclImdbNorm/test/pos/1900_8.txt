the various law & order and csi franchises had better be glad dolomite doesn't pass through. the lady cops,adas,and coroners would all be enthralled and the males be subject to such soul shivering,badge melting warp speed kicks ( wouldn't you just love to see david caruso's horatio and that know it all on csi get dolomite's hush puppies pulled from their respective asses)ice t might start crying and get back on the playa trail.<br /><br />low low budget,bad but enthusiastic acting,and a vision at what gutbucket nightclubs offered to its patrons;funk bands soul singers,the last vestiges of old style chitlin circuit entertainers( that weirdling dance troupe)james brown,wilson pickett,otis redding,and a host of others came from those clubs to glory, while their peers labored on in local or regional stardom. rudy ray moore came from that background and the character of dolomite is a mix of the bold black badasses who strutted through. he shouldn't have went to the joint, the swine didn't have a warrant, how his middle aged ,blubbery self maintained a loyal stable of kung fu wenches is a mystery only a student of cults can explain, but all that is beside the point. it's a glorious home movie of a legendary performer that compared to the mirrors of actors ranging from established hollywood to indie film snorefests,hits its mark. a fun dumb movie!
