i am a big fan of the 1995 version, which i have seen many times and consider a subtle, excellent film. this 1971 version i bought yesterday, a bit hesitantly, but now that i have seen it i am glad i did, because it is truer to the book and to austen's insights. the 1995 version has more dramatic power largely because it sharpens many of the characters -- in the 1995 version lady russell is snobbier, more manipulative, less truly looking out for anne; sir walter is even more vain and vapid; elizabeth is nastier; mary is more insufferable; mr. elliot is more smarmy; lady dalrymple is much more stupid -- but i think the characterizations in this 1971 version are closer to the book, to austen's vision, and to the real people of the time. the 1971 version also includes more of the key lines and scenes from the book, including especially the key scene in the field where anne overhears wentworth talking to louisa (or is it henrietta?) about the importance of strength of character. i found the acting more subtle and evocative than do many of the critics here, but the acting in the 1995 version is more powerful. i agree with the critics here that the actress who plays anne is too old for the part; i looked up her entry on imdb and she was 38 at the time of the filming, when her character is supposed to be 28. i thought her acting was subtle and effective, however. wentworth is of the correct age and i found him very convincing. in particular, this 1971 version of wentworth has much more of his sense of humor and teasing; the 1995 one, much more of the sense of power a sea captain would have, and more passion. the admiral in the 1971 version lacks the gruff presence and human warmth of the one in the 1995 version and lacks any feeling of the power an admiral certainly would convey; i found him the one truly weak element in the production. i agree with others that the staging of the "falling" scene was too wooden, and it seemed unconvincing that she would have been so injured by such a little fall. however, it could be that she banged the back of her head on the edge of the stone step, which if so, really would produce a very dangerous injury, and would make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version, where she falls farther but is clear of any sharp edge that could plausibly cause a major head injury. as to the costuming that some have criticized, i am no expert and can't respond, but i will note that none of the navy characters (wentworth, admiral croft, benwick, harville) in the 1971 version wear their uniforms, while in the 1995 version all of them consistently wear their fancy uniforms. i suspect that the 1971 version is the accurate one, and it always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version, the officers being always in uniform when clearly the nation is at peace and the officers are detached from active duty. my father and grandfather were career us navy captains who commanded aircraft carriers and submarines, and they did not spend every day while on leave or at leisure in their dress blues. i doubt it was any different 180 years ago. the uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of zing, and i prefer it, but i doubt it is accurate historically that these officers wore their uniforms so frequently. lastly, it is true, the production values of the 1971 version are a lot less than the 1995 version, but given the year (1971), the tv format, and the budget, we can't blame the artists for it. contemporary viewers who can make a mental allowance for the lower production values can find this version well worth their time.
