"the honkers" is probably slim pickens best performance of all time. when we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that slim was academy award material. unfortunately, united artists had a james bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to "the honkers". i personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. sam peckinpaw's "junior bonner" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. also, cliff robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too. the picture is worth watching, if just for the rodeo footage--some of the best ever filmed--shot by james crabbe. the director and my co-writer, steve ianat, died a few weeks after the picture's release, cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife sally, his daughter, gaby, and newborn son, stefan. please give this movie a shot. i'm betting that you'll say it was well worth while. i thank anyone who has taken the time to read this. stephen lodge
