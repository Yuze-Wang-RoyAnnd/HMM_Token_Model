this is not the best movie you might ever see, but it still is very refreshing. of course, it has it's flaws, it has it's humbling moments and yet at the same time it's different from all the sh*t you're used to and is funny in a way only the french can give you this. you might recognize a little from the masterpiece amelie, when you see the opening. i give it 7 out of 10, but still reccomend it to you if you're tired of the usual bore you can rent in the videostore.
