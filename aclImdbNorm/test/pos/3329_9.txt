tex avery's tenure as director of cartoons for mgm was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. his cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with many weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie the mask. eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.<br /><br />this is one of several droopy cartoons that avery was responsible for and it's among his best. droopy is a mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison. throughout the film, despite many insane stunts, droopy keeps up with this crook until eventually the wolf gives up because droopy is seemingly everywhere! full of funny gags and loaded with laughs, this is a great cartoon.
