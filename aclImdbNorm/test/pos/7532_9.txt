writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. this is a marvelous story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. feeling, this film was made for people that like to feel, and just to feel, life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. we look at it, and something starts growing inside our minds, even our hearts: it a pure poem. i've watched some "gay" movies, and i almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because i don't like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that i'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. nagisa no shindobaddo is totally different from that ones. three are the main characters. we have ito, yoshida and aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. ito likes his best friend yoshida, yoshida likes aihara and aihara likes ito. imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? but in the contrary, hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, in the end of the movie: why? and that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. the scenes, actually, sometimes tending to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel, but totally unable to write down in words. and maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie. i'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it
