i love sarah waters's fingersmith, and was worried about the tv adaptation as i'd been disappointed by the bbc's version of tipping the velvet (which although beautiful to look at was let down by keeley hawes not being able to sing, and rachael stirling not being able to act). fingersmith is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and i wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours.<br /><br />i needn't have worried. the adaptation was excellent, very little cut out, and went along at a cracking pace (although i did wonder whether if you hadn't read the book, would you miss things?). it had the look and feel of a bbc classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book.<br /><br />the acting was stellar. sally hawkins acting her heart out as sue trinder, and elaine cassidy, a slow burner, who by the end of the story was incandescent as maud lilley. the love, the passion, the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform, were written on their faces. it was a joy to watch.<br /><br />i hope rachael stirling was watching: that's how you play a sarah waters character!
