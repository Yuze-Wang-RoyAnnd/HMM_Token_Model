my father has worked with top secret information in the dia before and he is the one who mentioned this movie to me. when i was a kid i would always ask him what would happen if he gave away secrets and he recommended this movie.<br /><br />in the movie it really puts 2, almost completely different friends! in a tangle they never really knew what the outcome would really be. the snowman, daulton really cracked me up because the movie portrayed him as just some drug pusher that did not know what he was arguing about, and in the movie it seemed like he got the worst of everything. the falcon, chris is just a guy that wanted to express his feelings on u.s government in a very radical view.<br /><br />for movie lovers this is a must see!!!
