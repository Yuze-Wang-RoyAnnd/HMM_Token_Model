the movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole american system. the correlations of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office. politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world. bushism's have become a way of life for americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon. oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end. the story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs, it ain't happening. leaves a lot for thought. overall i enjoyed it.
