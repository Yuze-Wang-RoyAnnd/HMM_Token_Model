look, we rated this a 10 on entertainment value. it's a comedy sure, not an epic like lord of the rings, or gone with the wind. still for comedy, particularly these days, it's a 10.<br /><br />not a long movie, moves quickly and easily. kelsey grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub, pitted against the us nuclear navy in a war game, designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (kinda ironic this plot...pre 911) don't take this topic seriously cause it's mostly laughs from start to finish.<br /><br />rob schneider is 2nd in command (like "frank burns") and pulls many laughs. all the others are perfect for their parts as well. rip torn and bruce dern.<br /><br />look plain and simple, you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you're not a prude (their is some language and innuendo) then rent it, or buy it (we did) and enjoy! i wish they would make a part 2!
