tim robbins makes a wonderful film. his wife (susan sarandon) gives a wonderful performance as the sister helen perjean who wants to help mattew poncelet (sean penn) who is accussed of murder and who also will die of an injection... 120 minutes of splended acting and touching scenes is what you get. great acting and it is a film that gives something to think about!<br /><br />susan sarandon deserves the oscar of 1995 best actress. it is probably one of her greatest films ever. <br /><br />i didn't see 'the craddle will rock" but i sure have to see more films of robbins. <br /><br />rating: 9 / 10 or ***1/2 out of 4. go and see.....
