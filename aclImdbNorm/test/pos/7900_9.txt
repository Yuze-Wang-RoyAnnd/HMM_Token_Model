vanaja is a film of superlatives. it has an exceptionally well thought-out cast with mamatha being the crowning jewel, a superb production and possibly pre-production with rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey of rural southern india through the eyes of a 15 year old, a remarkable mixture of song and dance, traditional and modern, blended perfectly, and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. what a towering achievement for a debut director!! the casting was absolutely dead-on. i wish india would come out with more of such films. this film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life. 9/10.
