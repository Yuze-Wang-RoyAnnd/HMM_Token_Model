as far as i know i've seen most of lucio fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on dvd now, and i would have to say this was his best "pre-zombie" offering. in fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. this is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. it's no mystery how they died, i guess, it's more who's doing it. is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch? is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of town, who used to do a lot of drugs? is it the village idiot, who gets nabbed early on because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time? you'll only know if you watch, and watch you should, for this is a top-notch mystery thriller, or should i say, a "giallo". i've seen this before but it's been a long time and upon a second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time. for those of you that only know lucio fulci for his zombie flicks, well, open your minds to this because it's well worth seeing and while the "monsters" in this are human, they're as nasty as anything dredged up in his later films. 9 out of 10 stars, see it! please....
