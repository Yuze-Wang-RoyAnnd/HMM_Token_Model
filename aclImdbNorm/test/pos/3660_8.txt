i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it. it's like taking a trip to india....colorful, magical, thought provoking. aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor. the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy. the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good. visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is like...dreamlike. sometimes it's hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real...the movie has that same quality. great soundtrack too!
