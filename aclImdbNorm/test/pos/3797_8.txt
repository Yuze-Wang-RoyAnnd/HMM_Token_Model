in this era when almost everything makes it on to dvd (i'm expecting to see the my mother the car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. there are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory dvd treatment. this one wasn't even released on vhs to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (arthur hiller, eli wallach, anne jackson, murray shisgal (notable later for co-writing tootsie), even dustin hoffman in his debut). it's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era. all films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made. this was released the same year as the president's analyst, another absurd masterpiece. that film was finally released on dvd and has developed a cult following. this film has many memorable bizarre, goofy, wacky moments. sure, it's painted in broad strokes and has silly go-go music throughout but that's part of its charm. it creates its own absurd universe. if whoever is in charge of dvd production for columbia pictures releases (i believe columbia released it) takes polls for new releases this gets my vote.
