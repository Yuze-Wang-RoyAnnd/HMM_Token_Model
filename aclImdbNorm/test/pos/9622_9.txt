while it's generally acknowledged one of the first martial arts movies to play here in the west, it's real impact comes in retrospect. lo lieh is very low key throughout and many of the fight scenes, while often hailed as innovative (which they were at the time of the movie's initial release), are a tad tame compared to what came after (particularly after bruce lee, who became the instant standard by which all others will forevermore be judged). that's not to say that five fingers of death/king boxer is anything less than a classic in its own right, because it is. like many of the leading characters in many martial arts movies, the character lieh plays lays low through most of the movie for a reason- but, when he cuts loose, he effectively cleans house. you can't ask for more than that.
