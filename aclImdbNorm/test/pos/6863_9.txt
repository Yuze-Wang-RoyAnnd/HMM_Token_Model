i was shocked at how good this german version of films such as scream was. surpassing all the modern american efforts at slasher films.<br /><br />it as what all those films don't. likable characters, genuine mystery, suspense, graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack.<br /><br />this stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years. german cinema is going from strength to strength just lately. its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out. it is easily available on dvd so even if you hate subtitles i think you should see it. it will be one of the best horror films you will see all year.
