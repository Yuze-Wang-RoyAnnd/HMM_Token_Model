i am so glad when i watch in every time the movie of (ray) for the sidney pottier of the 21st century (jamie foxx) who played this role as an evidence of his brilliant ability as an actor to take his position beside great actors in hollywood by his golden supporting for the strong abilities of afro american actors all over the times and periods by his eternal work as an evidence for the eternity of ray charles as a grand prove for their legend appearance in every time by their success for winning oscar prize as (best actor for leading role) an (best mixing sound) between fact and cinematic scenes upon ray and jamie as a mixing between two copies of ray (ray of the past) and (ray of 2004 acted in the person of jamie foxx).it was nice from the director to choose those songs to be adapted with dramatical scenes in the accidents of film to enter for the atmosphere of success in legend corn with legend movies in hollywood since 1893 till now and his cleverness of choosing sharon warrne in the role of ray ,s mother that she succeeded in this role by brilliant analysis for the core of her character that ray,s mother was the turning point for him upon her grew up to be independent on himself to take his place in this world and to be icon in his talent as (nat king cole , louis armstrong , duke ellington) and at the end of this film by receiving his honorable report from gerogia and their decision to take his song (georgia on my mind) the national anthem for this state he made his promise for his mother to be alive until now by his legend songs and brilliant life.
