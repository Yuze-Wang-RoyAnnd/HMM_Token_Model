captain corelli's mandolin is one of nicolas cage's better films. he turns a fine performance as the title character. this is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. john hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by penelope cruz, some honest advice about love. this movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. this movie also allows cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it. again, nicolas cage did not disappoint.
