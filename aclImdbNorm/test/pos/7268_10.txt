i'm amazed that i have a real affection for this one inasmuch as i'm not an action and adventure lover. but hey... it's pretty tough to go wrong with a robert carlyle film. i've read several poor or temperate reviews on this film, pulling it apart for it's period errors or unlikely plot development, but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition which features how a hardened, down-on-his-luck scoundrel (carlyle) transforms into a rather noble, selfless hero and how the pretty-boy, cowardly vagrant (miller)develops a real taste for the life of a highway man once he "gets the feel of it." filled with lots of bad-boy humor, lavish scenes (particularly the use of "fireworks" by former apothacary plunkett) and a charmingly ecclectic musical score, plunkett & macleane is a fast-paced,highly enjoyable piece of film making. it's certainly worth your viewing time for the climax scene alone! shoot 'em up, boys!
