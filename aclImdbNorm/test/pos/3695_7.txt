without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...tv movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is "no one to blame here".<br /><br />i disagree. yes, the young male lover of beverly d'angelo, played by rob estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. ok, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her, but i don't buy it. people have to take responsibility for their actions. not only did he "cross the line" by having sex with a very vulnerable teen, when he was supposedly "the responsible adult",he said, "your mom must never know about this." how responsible was he then? yes, it's a good flick, but he got what was coming to him. don't kid yourselves folks that what happened was "no one's fault".
