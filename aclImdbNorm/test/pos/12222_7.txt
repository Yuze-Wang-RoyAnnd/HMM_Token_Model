this dvd set is the complete widescreen 15-episode run of "surface", a television show made by universal in 2006. the full running time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus a few bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, special effects featurette). this was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget makes it to the screen in the form of quality production design and special effects. <br /><br />unfortunately 10+ hours is a lot of time and as typically happens with this type of stuff, the overall quality begins to fall off in the later episodes. i found the first 7 episodes (discs 1 and 2) extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment. "surface" was produced, written and directed by josh and jonas pate; and it appears that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to cobble together enough good subsequent material as they rushed to fill the order for additional episodes. it even looks like additional writers were brought in for the later episodes because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack consistency with the way they were played in the early episodes. the series was canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion of sorts there are still a lot of things left hanging. <br /><br />it is basically a science fiction story about genetically created dragons; sort of a television blend of "jurassic park" and "et". the story begins as a puzzle as a crew-less navy sub is found adrift at sea, boaters on a texas lake are sucked into whirlpool, a lighthouse in africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. etc. and as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense. a human element is introduced in the form of three american families, one on each coast and one on the gulf of mexico. laura daughterty (lake bell) is a california marine biologist who discovers a strange creature rising from an undersea thermal vent on the ocean floor. rich connelly (jay r. ferguson) is diving with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother away (never to be seen again). <br /><br />miles bennett (carter jenkins) is a wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean. he takes one home where it hatches into an "et" type dragon. he will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from the local authorities. these dragons may look like lizards but they are more like indestructible electric eels, firing electromagnetic pulses, causing lightning strikes, emptying the sea of fish, and reproducing like a bunch of randy rabbits when they find an undersea thermal vent of boiling water. as long as it's uncertain whether or not they're intelligent, extraterrestrial, or harmless the premise is interesting. once you begin to suspect their origin it all gets very tired and predictable. <br /><br />jay r. ferguson (a staggeringly bad actor in the tradition of david hasselhoff) essentially plays the richard dreyfuss character from "close encounters of the third kind", so you know that with a better actor and a better director it could have been an interesting character. you will grow to hate this character more with each episode. unfortunately what starts out as three parallel story lines is soon condensed into two as ferguson and bell (a low-budget version of sandra bullock) are soon paired up and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as improbable as the stuff "jason bourne" gets himself into. you expect plot holes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show (that can even be part of the fun) but their adventures are not just totally implausible, they are utterly and completely boring. there are three consecutive episodes that feature ferguson and bell together in a submersible that will have you longing for the excitement of an all-day actuarial conference. <br /><br />jenkins (miles) is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his pet dragon (nimrod) are inter-cut often enough with the boring ferguson-bell stuff to keep you watching. and these segments benefit from the presence of gorgeous leighton meester (of recent "gossip girl" fame) as his sister savannah. apparently the producers picked up on the importance of this to their "teenage boy" target audience and the one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to introduce linsey godrey (caitlin) as a "first love" interest for miles. so as savannah's screen time decreases catlin is gradually phased in. <br /><br />in retrospect they needed a third storyline to keep viewers sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors. <br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
