this is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. while not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. the scene where zachary scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. it defines his character beautifully -- a guy who's so low, he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades. he lies easily as the situation calls for, and captivates the women in the fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile.<br /><br />i couldn't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of mildred pierce. scott and bruce bennett were teamed again, and faye emerson bears some resemblance to joan crawford, with her facial bone structure and large eyes. also, the mona freeman character is not unlike the odious veda in mildred pierce.<br /><br />i agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat, with the convenient tumble over a cliff for "ronnie mason", zachary scott's character. also, in one of the final scenes, we see bratty mona freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older, smoother zachary scott. i think the script should've called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister, instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode. but these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well-made movie.
