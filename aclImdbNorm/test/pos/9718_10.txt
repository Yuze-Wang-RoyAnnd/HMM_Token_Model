jim henson always seemed to put out wonderful television shows. this was sadly one of the shortest lived. it was endearing to hear each tale with their delightful morals. each episode was a new story, with new characters. john hurt did a wonderful job playing the storyteller, and the sarcastic tone of brian henson as the dog was always enjoyable.<br /><br />the set designs and costumes were very well done. the muppet work, when required, is classic jim henson work. you know it is a muppet, but it's endearing appearance more than forgives. you find yourself enchanted and compelled. when each episode comes to an end, you realize that you were quite entertained. an entertained that is fulfilling, not the kind that wears off after a few moments. you sit back and think about each episode, realizing that each story is indeed timeless, and presents a strong tale of morality.<br /><br />i have yet to show this to my own children, but this is indeed a series that is more than family entertainment. i implore you to find it on dvd, and snatch it up. if you can't do that, then just find it some how.
