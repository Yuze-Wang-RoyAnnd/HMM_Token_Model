just reading the reviews of this wonderful bbc mini series reminded me how much i enjoyed this when it was first broadcast many years ago. at the time i remember waiting with anticipation for the next installment and fell in love with john bowe and janet mcteer ,two talented actors that we don't see enough of on tv or cinema these days. <br /><br />i have tried without success to obtain several of the bbcs fantastic dramas from the past, including the 1973 version of jane eyre and the 1972 version of anne of green gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories, which sadly the bbc seem to have no intention of releasing on video or dvd. if anyone learns otherwise i would love to hear from them.<br /><br />in the meantime we will have to content ourselves with our recollections of how wonderful they were.
