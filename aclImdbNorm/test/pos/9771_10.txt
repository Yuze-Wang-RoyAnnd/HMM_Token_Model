i saw this drama by cable tv. although i saw just two series, i love this drama. i'm waiting for more series will be aired by cable.<br /><br />even though it describes horrible, absurd situation in a prisoner's camp, this one shows us an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. they don't know whether they can survive or not, but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity.<br /><br />i know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary, but i don't want to blame for it. it makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. <br /><br />'private bill' , especially, this episode touched deep in my heart.<br /><br />i remember every scene. i always hate mathematics. but after seeing this drama, i can understand something about mathematics... mathematics is his connection between past and present, also symbolizes eternity.<br /><br />'time, light and memory framed in a circle.'<br /><br />like other victims of war, he lost his lover by irresistible fate. i'm immersed in his time and memory as if i experienced same thing.<br /><br />he experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study.<br /><br />he started his study in the camp, his joy of realize,<br /><br />i believe his dedication of study sustained him.<br /><br />i saw it several times, but the meaning of this film never faded. every time i saw it, i feel same deep emotion.<br /><br />* their songs are beautiful, harmonious,<br /><br />i'm sorry that i can't listen ost.
