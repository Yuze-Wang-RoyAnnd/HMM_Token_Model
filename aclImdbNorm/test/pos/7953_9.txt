i really appreciate what jung-won had done before his death. everything. i want to say that his choice for love is unselfish. if he chose da-rim , that will be good for him. but da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. obviously he does not want to let it happen. as he did in the film, he chose giving up. so it was just temporary agony for da-rim.<br /><br />as comparison, my life without me is very different. their behavior shows big difference between eastern culture and western culture. i cannot say which is better. every one can has right to choose. that is totally up to you. life is equal for everybody. we can live only once. any choice is acceptable if only you think it is fit for you.<br /><br />in truth the slow pace of the film cannot be the excuse for rejecting the movie. just calm down. you will get more from the movie.<br /><br />one of the best korean movies i ever watched. 9/10
