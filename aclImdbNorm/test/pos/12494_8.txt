and i love it!!! wonder showzen will pick up a cult audience and once it's canceled, the dvd sales will go though the roof. this is a very funny show in it's own ways. it's a parody of children's shows, namely sesame street. our puppet characters consist of chauncy, a yellow furry monster with a hat, whose our host. clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets. him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person. wordsworth is the smart one whose brain always shows. then there's the newscaster and the pink puppet. it's a very funny show, not really as nasty as you'd expect, but more the situations. they take 7 year olds out on the street, tell them what to say, and have them make mean jokes that they don't understand. my favorite segments are clarence's videos, especially when somebody doesn't want to be filmed. i prefer tv funhouse, which was a similar show, but this is still a very funny show that i hope lasts for years to come.<br /><br />my rating: *** 1/4 out of ****. 30 mins. tv ma.
