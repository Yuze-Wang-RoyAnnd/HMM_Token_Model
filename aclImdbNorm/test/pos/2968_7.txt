after seeing meredith in "beyond the prairie" i had to buy another film with her staring. i cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. it's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on meredith as she moves across the screen. save your money until the tv network comes out with a dvd on "beyond the prairie". it's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. <br /><br />this pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. perhaps some of her latest might fit but i haven't seen them. she has the smile of a cathrine bell and eyes of dana delany with a much younger body.<br /><br />
