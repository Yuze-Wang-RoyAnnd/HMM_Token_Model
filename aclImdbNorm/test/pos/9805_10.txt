i rented the movie and liked it so much that i bought it. elijah wood (mikey) and joseph mazello (bobby) are outstanding as the two boys. their new stepfather physically abuses bobby. the abuse is implied, for the most part, not seen, and roused a lot of passion in me to help abused children. there is a magical quality to the movie as the boys' imagination helps them find a way to deal with the abuse. you have to try to understand the story from a child's point of view. i'm still thinking about the ending. i've watched the movie 3 or 4 times and each time i think of possible new meanings. i'm not sure exactly what richard donner intended me to think, but this is an excellent film! joseph mazello and elijah wood will make you go hug your kids.
