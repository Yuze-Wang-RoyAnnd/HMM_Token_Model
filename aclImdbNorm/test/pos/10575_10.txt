this was indeed an amazing adaption. i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline. but as soon i watched the second and then the third instalment i was just blown away. i ordered the dvd less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come i went straight out and brought the book. from the moment i opened it i was hooked, i just couldn't put it down. i decided to finish the whole book before i dare watch the dvd at all. i preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds, you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story. they missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and i think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time. but considering only being able to be fitted into a 3 hour slot i think it was done excellent. it followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly. and the actors which were enrolled as the main characters where amazing! the love making scene was pure beautiful. it was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. i was totally blown away with both the book and the tv adaption! i loved both of sarah waters previous novels and also found the tipping the velvet adaption quite enjoyable. but when i read and watched fingersmith i knew none of her previous novels/adaption could beat it. sarah waters has indeed exceeded herself this time! i recommend that you watch this adaption! if tipping the velvet wasn't your thing, then don't let it put you off this one. fingersmith is a whole new ball game. it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love, greed and betrayal...<br /><br />a must see!
