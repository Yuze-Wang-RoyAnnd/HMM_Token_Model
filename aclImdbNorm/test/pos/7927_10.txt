tom clancy uses "alesandr nevsky" in his book "red storm rising". in the book, nevksy was show in theatres across russia as a prelude to the soviet invasion of west germany. i felt i had to check it out. it was excellant! the cinematography was magnificent and storyline incredible. i do not regret watching this movie and added in to my collection.
