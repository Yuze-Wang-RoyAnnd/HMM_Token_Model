i have just finished watching this film for the first time, and i must say that i am very impressed.<br /><br />how bleak. how full of despair. how nightmarish. incredible.<br /><br />visually stunning, several scenes are embedded in my mind...the first appearance of the phantom carriage...the soul of david holm as it rises from his corpse...his spirit on his knees, pleading.<br /><br />this film takes a simple story-that of the ghostly driver of the phantom carriage, doomed to collect the souls of the dead for a year-brings it into the present setting of the film and then uses flashbacks as a means to explain how david holm ends up in his predicament.<br /><br />i would love to see this released on dvd so that more might see it. everyone should.
