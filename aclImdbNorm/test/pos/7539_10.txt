alistair simms inspired portrayal of miss fritton transcends drag. it is one of the great comedy characters in film. equally wonderful is joyce grenfell's character - ruby gates.<br /><br />this is a movie you should curl up on the sofa with on a wet sunday's afternoon and be transported to a time long ago when terrifying, rampaging school girls only gained our respect - not our ire! i hear that a remake is in the offing with rupert everett as miss fritton? he will have a hard job competing with the master - or should that be mistress? - alistair simms.<br /><br />go and rent it - it beats so much of what today goes for comedy.
