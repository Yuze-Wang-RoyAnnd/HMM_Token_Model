this is a true gem of corny sci-fi! peter cushing adds a great personality to this midnite movie classic.<br /><br />i particularly like the sound design. the weird choppy voices of the creatures and the rhino creatures all provide a bizarre backdrop (of course the scantily clad babe doesn't hurt either!)<br /><br />
