a demon, from a tree, removes itself in the form of a human man to make love to a young fair maiden only for her to die. the demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall onto a bed he had specially created for his object of desire. the bed consumes the blood and it's hunger remains..anything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed! this is explained to us by one of the bed's victims, a painter whose soul is trapped "inside" one of his last works, the artistic rendering of the his final resting place(..he was dying of consumption, coughing up blood, deciding to die on the death bed). you see the painter, who we are able to see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting, unfortunately a spectator to the bed's meals. the bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see this through it's allowing the painter to live, even giving him jewelry and other possessions once owned by eaten victims. one victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement housing the bed. the film features three young women who come across the mansion which holds the basement containing the death bed. the painter(dave marsh)might just have a method to destroying the death bed but it will include a human sacrifice in order to resurrect the body of the one whose death caused it's hunger in the first place. patrick spence-thomas provides the soft, depressing voice of the trapped painter, narrating the film, lamenting about his current situation, telling us about past victims, and often scolding the bed of it's predatory nature.<br /><br />a definitive, genuine cult film..i expect it's status to soar now that death bed:the bed that eats has found it's way to an audience(..such as myself)who appreciates the bizarre and grotesque. the bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with an apple-cider hue where we see the objects and humans(..struggling for naught) consumed. many might recognize a young william russ(boy meets world, the unholy)in curls, seeking after his runaway sister, finding her in the basement, zombie-like and traumatized(..of course, julie ritter pretty much was this way the whole film, in a trance, barely uttering a word)with them both trapped. in one of the film's most demented scenes, russ attempts to stab the bed only for his hands to get caught in it's grip, the flesh acidified with only skeletal bones remaining, the cartilage deteriorating. there's one lengthly attempted escape by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed, almost out of the basement when it's sheets snatched her back into it's belly where she belonged. the film feels almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. director george barry often features gags regarding the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position choosing the death bed as their place of refuge..the painter gives us a recollection of all the various people who were eaten. there's really nothing like this movie anywhere, it's definitely one of a kind.
