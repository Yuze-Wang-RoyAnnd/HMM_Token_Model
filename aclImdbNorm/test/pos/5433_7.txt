i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams, but when i saw it i realized i had bee lied to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy, although it has a few really good laughs in it. it felt like i was watching two movies. one was a funny romp with robin williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway, but you also get a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle. i really don't know how to classify this film. but i can tell you it was good and i did laugh, not as much as i had hoped, but at least williams is back in the right direction. see this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense.
