a real surprise. not exactly family entertainment from "disney". some violence, lots of tense moments, and a great story, based on fact. the theme of "night crossing" is, determination wins. never losing sight of their objective, two east german families risk it all, in their daring balloon escape to freedom. the story is both harrowing and heartwarming. time is not on their side. the east german police are closing in and the outcome far from certain, until the very end. if you are looking for a good evenings entertainment, that contains no nudity, and limited violence, then i highly recommend "night crossing". it is pure entertainment. - merk
