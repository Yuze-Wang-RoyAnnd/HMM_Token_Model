watching stranger than fiction director marc forster's the kite runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables because this art-house epic rated pg-13 is good for your movie-going diet. no, this isn't the kind of movie that i like to slouch on the couch and eyeball at the end of a tough day. the kite runner isn't your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your troubles. first, no celebrity stars appear in it. second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so outlandish that you don't believe an image that you see. third, the kite runner lapses into subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native tongue. fourth, forster's film isn't a romantic trifle about boy-wants-girl, boy-loses-girl, and then boy-wins-girl back. fifth, this foreign language film may make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship, and survival. the chief themes here are cowardice and redemption. the protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that he must atone for at the cost of his own personal safety and integrity. right, the kite runner is about redeeming oneself for the sins of the past. we're talking about personal accountability, so don't rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy's night out celebration or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system. based on khaled hosseini's bestselling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama about right and down initially looks like one of those light-hearted friendship movies about adolescents in the vein of the adventures of tom sawyer and the sandlot. about a half-hour into its 127 minutes, this escapade about two youngsters who fly kites in afghanistan turns dark and unsavory. nevertheless, if you can handle the remaining hour of the plot, you'll emerge gratified, relieved, and perhaps even entertained. <br /><br />the kite runner opens in san francisco in the year 2000 as our protagonist, afghan 'emigr'e amir jan (khalid abdalla of united 93) and his wife soraya (atossa leoni of the florist) receive two boxes of published copies of amir's first novel. no sooner has amir had a chance to bask in his triumph of a life-time as a storyteller than the phone jars him from his reverie and he is drawn reluctantly back into a past that is best left forgotten for him. rahim khan (shaun toub of the nativity story) calls amir from pakistan to make a request. rahim was a servant in amir's household back in the 1970s when amir lived with his wealthy pashtun merchant father baba (homayoun ershadi of a taste of cherry) in afghanistan before the soviet invasion. "you have one more chance to be good," rahim informs amir without sugar coating his request. basically, rahim wants amir to fly to pakistan and then enter war-torn afghanistan and rescue rahim's young grandson sohrab (ali danish bakhty ari) who is being held a prisoner against his will as a sex slave for assef (newcomer abdul salam yusoufzai) a cruel taliban chieftain and amir's once dreaded adversary. <br /><br />the kite runner shifts from san francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback set in kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic. twelve-year-old amir (zekiria ebrahimi) and the son of his father's servant, hassan (ahmad khan mahmoodzada) love to watch movies, such as john sturges' western the magnificent seven, when they aren't flying kites. incidentally, this is kite flying like you've never seen kite flying. not only do the kids fly them, but they also compete with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another kid's kite. the kite fighting flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in tony scott's top gun. hassan is amir's best friend but unlike amir, hassan belongs to the reviled hazara minority. earlier, young amir and hassan had a confrontation with young assef (elham ehsas) and his two flunkies. assef was about to beat them up, but hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatened to use it on assef. assef had no choice but to back down. meanwhile, amir was prepared to suffer the hand fate had dealt him. amir's father baba laments his son's lack of spine and fears that he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward, unlike the plucky little hassan who bails amir out of predicaments. anyway, amir and hassan emerge from the showdown with assef without a scratch. later, after amir sets a new record with his kite flying and fight skills, hassan runs after a kite to claim it. hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title. hassan claims the fallen kite but he finds himself at the mercy of assef and his two minions. assef lets hassan kept the kite, but his minions pin hassan spread-eagle, belly down in an alley while assef sodomizes the youth. worst, a traumatized amir watches the assault from nearby but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him.<br /><br />aside from the extraordinary aerial scenes with the kites, the kite runner is down-to-earth, straight-forward stuff. when amir returns to afghanistan to rescue sohrab, he masquerades as a taliban fighter but he doesn't carry a firearm. the rescue scene in the kite runner is rather like the escape scene from the midnight express. while forster doesn't explore the local politics or plunge us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here. indeed, troy scenarist david benioff had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices aren't clearly delineated so you have to accept some things on faith. forster lensed the film in nearly china to give it an authentic look. forster deserves credit for making this two hour plus epic fascinating. the performances, especially by the children, stand out for their believability. the kite runner is a film that you won't easily forget.
