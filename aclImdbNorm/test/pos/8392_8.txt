not your everyday tom and jerry short for many reasons. one, there's a voiceover narration by jerry, which is odd, because tom and jerry rarely speak. two, the two are friends, which was also rare and seldom works as well as the more adversarial shorts do. third, and most importantly, the cartoon is rarely humorous (by design) and the jokes here are dry chuckles with a little cough and a bubble of blood at the end. think a tom and jerry cartoon directed by tim burton. not wholly successful, but it largely does work. the creepiest ending for an mgm short that i can recall. not for everyone and proof that these shorts were never intended solely with children as the target audience. well worth watching. recommended with the caveats above.
