the above profile was written by me when i used the nick of oldwerewolf56 which is still my email address. i still believe andy devine's character of frisky is the best twilight zone's episodes ever and i watch this episode at least once a year as i consider frisby to be a fortunate man as he has many friends who love him dearly. <br /><br />in case many of you are too young to remember, i'm 61, andy devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50's i believe called andy's gang. on it he had three assistants: a cat named midnight who played the violin, a mouse named squeaky who played an a hand organ and a devilish toad named froggy who's could appear and disappear at will embarrassing many of andy's funny guest stars like billy gilbert.
