i will admit i possibly missed tiny moments when i wasn't paying proper attention, but i got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film, from director lionel jefferies, who played grandpa potts in chitty chitty bang bang. basically it starts with a happy upper-middle class family living in victorian london. one night the father (iain cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and he leaves with them, and does not return. they move to a cottage in the country, and here the children; bobbie (jenny agutter, who i first saw in child's play 2), phyllis (sally thomsett) and peter (gary warren) keep their spirits up, with their fascination for the nearby railroad. everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes. their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. also starring dinah sheridan as mother/mrs. waterbury, bernard cribbins as albert perks, william mervyn as old gentleman, peter bromilow as doctor forrest, ann lancaster as ruth and gordon whiting as russian. it was number 29 on the 100 greatest family films, and it was number 24 on the 50 greatest british films. very good!
