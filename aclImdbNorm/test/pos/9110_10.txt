this film rocks...so hard...<br /><br />the cameos...the drug references...the sharing...the love...the rocking!!! when jack and kyle first met in tim robbins' "actors' gang" theater company years ago, who knew that such a legacy of awesome music and hilariousness would ensue?? all that door to door rocking paid off...<br /><br />although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a major kick out of this film, i would definitely recommend renting the original 6 hbo episodes at your local video store before going to see the film in the cinema. they're on the tenacious d masterworks dvd, which is available for rent at pretty much every video store. there are some inside jokes in the film that refer to these earlier episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience...
