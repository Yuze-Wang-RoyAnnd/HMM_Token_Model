believe it or not, the mona lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. in 1911, leonardo da vinci's 'la gioconda' (better known as the mona lisa) was taken from the louvre by a petty thief (and former louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native italy. his actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) the mona lisa was quietly returned to the louvre on the very last day of 1913, remaining there ever since except for occasional loan-outs. when "ars`ene lupin" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most moviegoers would have recalled that 1911 crime, and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this movie. "ars`ene lupin" is quite enjoyable, with mgm's usual high production standards and jack conway's usual briskly efficient direction. this movie does not lack for pleasure; what it lacks is plausibility.<br /><br />john barrymore is the master criminal of the title: he specialises in perpetrating 'impossible' crimes, which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance ... but of course he always commits the crime and fools the gendarmes. tully marshall has a good scene as one of barrymore's victims. lupin has a penchant for elaborate disguises, which enables barrymore (a u.s. 'grade a' ham) to indulge his own penchant for tomfoolery. john's older brother lionel barrymore is guerchard, the javert-like surete detective sworn to catch lupin.<br /><br />karen morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities; on screen, she was most impressive in working-class roles that fitted her own political beliefs (such as her fine performance in 'our daily bread'). in "ars'ene lupin", morley's naturally dark hair is bleached a horrid blonde tone, and she's all tarted up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy.<br /><br />spoilers coming. eventually, lupin decides to steal the mona lisa from the louvre. he slits the painting from its frame, rolls up the canvas, and then smuggles it out in a flower basket. we see john barrymore casually brandishing a tightly-rolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history. i had to laugh at the filmmakers' error. in real life (but not in this movie), da vinci painted the mona lisa on a plank of poplar wood, so a thief would have difficulty rolling it up!<br /><br />eventually, guerchard captures lupin and hauls him off to le calaboose. the scene between john and lionel barrymore in the police car is sheer delight, as their genuine affection for each other spills out into their characters' dialogue. i would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors. as it is, i can't imagine anyone but the barrymore brothers playing these roles. well, maybe dennis and randy quaid, but just barely.<br /><br />don't look for a good plot line here, but "ars`ene lupin" is a delightful example of old-style movie-making. i'll rate this movie 8 points out of 10.
