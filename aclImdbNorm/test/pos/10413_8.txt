this was one of the best half-hour horror/suspense/fantasy shows of the eighties, without a doubt. granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode, and it stank as far as production values (i.e. the sets) went, but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots. i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i, a hardened horror movie, shock-film, and 70's grind-house buff got a little sickened and creeped out. great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers have said here. my favorite episode was called "bug house", yeah that was the title i think? anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day, almost 20 years after it first premiered. other shows like "tales from the darkside", "the outer limits" and (of course) "the twilight zone" were definitely better production values-wise, but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show! it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was, "tales from the crypt".
