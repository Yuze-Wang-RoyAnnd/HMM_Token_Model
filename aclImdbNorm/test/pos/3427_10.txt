archbishop desmond tutu, who is seldom a favorite of mine, said that everyone should see this film as it is something that can help heal the world....<br /><br />it is one of the most poignant movies i have seen and delivers on tutu's comments.... i have read many comments and while they range from good to average to comments on the choice of actors... the fact is that it deals with one of the most extra-ordinary events in our world. the truth and reconciliation commission.... for the first time a country has opted to air it's horrific history, to find a way forward and to create a way for people to heal...<br /><br />while the movie starts out with the white policeman being offered a chance to absolve himself for brutal crimes and the black guy is trying to ensure that he does not get away with it, it delves into the humanity of the people and the enormous need for healing that we all need....<br /><br />definitely a thumbs up..... to everyone involved.... once again, i am proud to be a south african.....<br /><br />an interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/article/196/97/5223.html
