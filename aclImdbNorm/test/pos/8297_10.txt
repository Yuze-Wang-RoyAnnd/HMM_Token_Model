once a year in america, saturday morning would give way to new cartoons, usually sometime in america. just about the time school started.<br /><br />i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearable.<br /><br />one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons, a movie came on.<br /><br />"at the earth's core" i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were. clearly they were not from the same country, so i couldn't grasp why they were traveling together.<br /><br />i do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire-breathing monster's mouth.<br /><br />what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory.<br /><br />how do you end a movie like this? the music again, and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them.<br /><br />whatever reason, i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning.<br /><br />that was definitely the late seventies.<br /><br />it would be during jurassic park mania, cicra '93, i believe, before i would see this movie again.<br /><br />yes, people in costumes. there was the fire-breather again.<br /><br />still loved the ending with the two cops.<br /><br />finally, it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd.<br /><br />now i would just watch the beginning and intro.<br /><br />oh, i do love much of the movie. of all these sci fi jules verne, hg wells, erb movies, this one stands as my fave.<br /><br />what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon, then turns back, then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill.<br /><br />perhaps for me, this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows, which is why i enjoy it so much.
