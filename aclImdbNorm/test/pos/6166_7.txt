it seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject, there is no shortage of stories that emerge from the second world war. it stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. heading in a different direction than most mainstream movies about the war is dark blue world, a film that does not deal with the traditional major battles of the war, does not tell the story of many of its major figures, and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major allied or axis powers. dark blue world instead ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations.<br /><br />the film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges faced by czech pilots flying under the british royal air force, expressing the frustration that they felt both at the language barrier between them and the other fliers, but also at being restrained from achieving vengeance against the germans until being re-trained.<br /><br />dark blue world also works quite well outside the arena of the war film as being a story about human relationships. a love triangle develops between the two main characters and an english woman that complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. this relationship is extremely well acted throughout, developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points.<br /><br />the aerial combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy, and relay commands and replies in an unfamiliar language. the tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground, just as the tension on the ground continues that felt in the air.<br /><br />this may not be a film for everyone. the hardcore war film buff may find its exploration of relationships a bit off-putting, but it is on the whole an excellent film regardless of the bellicose element or not.
