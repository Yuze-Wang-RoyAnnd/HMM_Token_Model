after traveling around the world, it dawned on me that australia really lacks one thing that other countries have: history.<br /><br />fortunately or unfortunately, australia wasn't establish following a war, it has not had a civil war and most of its political history is rather..... boring! nothing "big" happened to mark some sort of turning point in australia's history.... until the dismissal of the whitlam government by the governor-general of australia - john kerr.<br /><br />for those who are australian, you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next. this is for the benefit of curious non-australians! australia was colonised by the british. as time went on, it became apparent that australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. accordingly, the uk granted australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. the law and politics of australia would no longer be provided directly from the british; rather, australia would be run by australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the british system. this shift was codified in the australian constitution. despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill of rights), their are two "pro-crown" sections that were included and remain there to this day. these are more or less regarded as the "reserve powers of the crown (king/queen of great britain)." the first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the governor-general. briefly, the governor-general is considered the queen's chief representative in australia and is described as the "executive" branch of the australian government. when a piece of law is passed by the australian parliament, the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the governor-general. as such, the govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the crown. theoretically, the governor-general can refuse to sign a law passed by australian parliament if he thinks fit. for instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the gg could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. however, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. by "convention" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the prime minister instructs the governor-general to sign it, he will, almost always without question. in fact, by "convention" the governor-general acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the prime minister of the day (and the prime minister alone). the second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the governor-general's "pleasure." now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or prime minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film "the dismissal.") whether 'at the governor-general's pleasure' can be construed as "the unfettered right to dismiss" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of australia.<br /><br />now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. it was well made. the pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. the drama was well contained and very realistic. it didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. on the contrary, i felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the governor-general's decision to dismiss the whitlam government. but i wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.<br /><br />in terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. the film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. there were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so i forgive them for that. further, i think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-vietnam war era, but noyce pretty much pulled it off.<br /><br />finally, i was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them. moreover, any that we're raised, for example connor's pipeline, had a great deal of relevance to the story. the film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints. this was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of misrepresenting one side's policies.<br /><br />the dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in australia in its short life. i am glad that it has been crystallized in celluloid. essential viewing for any australian.
