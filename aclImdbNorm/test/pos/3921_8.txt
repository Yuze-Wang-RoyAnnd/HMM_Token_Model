admittedly, before seeing house of wax, i assumed it would simply be a second tier low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as the darkness or amityville horror. after catching an advanced showing at my college campus, i can honestly say that the people at dark castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher. <br /><br />starting with the usual staples of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends departing on a road trip, coming across an odd detour taking them through country back-roads, meeting creepy locals, after the slow but mandatory back-story this movie really reaches a fast clip. paris hilton appears in this film as many already know, but i really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance. clearly her acting wasn't worth an oscar, but the filmmakers use her appearance to its fullest by squeezing two blatant satires of her, let's just say, less noble media appearance into this film. ms. hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie, and not simply because it was her death scene.<br /><br />this movie is full to the brim with jumpy moments and cheap scares, but jaume serra has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters. the causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters, which we do. by making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments. these standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film, and provide many good scares. in fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded house of wax museum is. <br /><br />this film owes a lot to many previous movies of this and other genres, though i'm not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title. references to such movies as both texas chainsaw masacres, saw, and even titanic, (see paris hilton's big death scene and you'll know what i mean) are common, but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs. not bad.
