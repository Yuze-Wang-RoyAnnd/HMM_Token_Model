this film makes several nods to various science fiction films. the prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of thx-1138 (the trailer for buck rogers, here it was clips from some early japanese sf tv show). then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard, reminding one immediately of bladerunner. the bladerunner aspect comes even<br /><br />more pronounced when we meet the hero, who is called a replicant (he is blond haired and is called ryo, a homage to roy batty, rutger hauer's character in bladerunner?). a battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of the matrix. the government forcing the population to take drugs is like thx-1138 and the chief enforcer, while looks like a cross between elvis and dan ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, very much like the terminator. the end battle reminds one of terminator 2 and the end result is hilarious. probably not one of the best sf films out there, but is enjoyable, certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like battlefield earth.
