after waiting years for a definitive collection of led zeppelin perfomances on video, fans have finally been rewarded with what is undoubtedly the greatest concert video ever! much better than the dismal "song remains the same", this video includes performances from no less than 5 different venues spanning a decade. it also includes rare interviews and tv appearances. the sound quality is amazing, considering the source material used. and the video quality is even more impressive. this is an absolute must for any led zeppelin fan.
