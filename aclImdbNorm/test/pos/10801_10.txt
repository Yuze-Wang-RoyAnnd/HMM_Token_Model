cinema, at its best is entertainment. if one is to question every aspect with which one finds room for disagreement,and much of recorded history is based on contemporary opinions - often biased - then one should leave the cinema, because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment. when i spotted an airplane flying overhead in a film dated 33bc i was amused. the background scenery in "casablanca" is absurdly fake. so, do i set up a moan & say that the film failed to convince? fiona, relax and enjoy some excellent acting. wajda's decision to cast the protagonists as french & polish was inspired. one was immediately aware of which side each of the main characters was representing. no need to dwell on the authenticity of the wigs. this is powerful cinema. if there is a political message which is still relevant today - have a dinner party - a ch^ateau d'yquem with the foie-gras; a puligny montrachet with the entree; some polish vodka sorbets and perhaps a 1961 ch^ateau lafite-rothschild with the beef - and discuss the political aspects of danton until you drop with fatigue. danton would surely have agreed?
