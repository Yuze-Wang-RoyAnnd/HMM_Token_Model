steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history. this second appearance of mickey mouse (following the silent plane crazy earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking. this is because it was the first sound cartoon. while you don't yet hear mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.<br /><br />now if this were just an important historical film, it would be worth seeing--especially to lovers of animation. however, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is. while mickey and minnie behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love (thanks mostly to the kooky mind and talent of animator ub iwerks), there is an infectious charm about the film. it's just adorable seeing mickey playing "turkey in the straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way. clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.
