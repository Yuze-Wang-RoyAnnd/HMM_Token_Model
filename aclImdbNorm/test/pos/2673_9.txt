when the movie first started i thought cheesy. the first ten minutes were really boring. after the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics, i started liking it. the plot was different than anything i had ever seen. now, was it a horror? not really. it shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. as it was, the creatures where only there for a short time. i can only assume this was for money reason.<br /><br />the good side was that the movie was very entertaining. it held my interest (after the start) and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension.<br /><br />it was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director, but there were a couple of highlights. by the end, i was hooked. too bad hollywood didn't put more money behind this.
