this film is outstanding! on this date of apr, 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time. it had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in. at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked, with a wife that seems close to going her own way. the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool. paulina porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot. trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry, paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron eckhart was cool at first, and he even loans him his wife's car to take care of some business. then he spots nicks silver briefcase, and the day changes for the weird and violent. there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. but, paulina's dallas steals the show i think. her telling of a casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application, is outrageous. as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy,but as with any rule there are exceptions. paulina is as one has never seen her before in films. sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with tom selleck, but with a never seen before malevolence. if your looking for film to add to your collection, this one is worth the price. paulina in the nude is worth the price alone, but this story has everything one might hope one has. love,friendship,sex and violence in a terrific mix. when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind, and i know you will feel the same way.
