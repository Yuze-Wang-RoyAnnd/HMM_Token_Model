exclusively for coop's lovers, though clint eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. it is a biography of gary cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (picasso, hemingway, etc.), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. after "the end", i did not have the feeling that i knew the man any much better. but i have spent a very good moment, re-viewing many of the best moments of his movies; and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional was increased tenfold. the film shows, most interestingly, how the career of cooper can be paralleled with the evolution of usa society before and after ww2. two of the great moments are the time when cooper has to answer justice about communism in the movie world; and when james stewart (a very great one, too) received an award for cooper one month before his death. i'm not a weeping pot, but... that was a close one! watch it, if you can: it is so much worth while. ... if you love cooper, that is. or an older america...
