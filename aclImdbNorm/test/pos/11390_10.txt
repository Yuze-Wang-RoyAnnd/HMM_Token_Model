a small town kid working in a big city becomes a huge star and then spirals out of control. it shows you the rise to fame and then fall from fame and back to a little rise. great cast of actors, and a great director = a great, great movie called boogie nights.<br /><br />p.t anderson. an amazing director who made boogie nights amazing. from the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends you can feel how beautiful this movie is. some scenes are breathtaking, literally. a great story, a great movie. mark whalberg was fantastic, philip seymour hoffman was wonderful as he is in everything. thomas jane also was magnificent and although he only had a small part he played it to perfection. there is one scene in this movie i can't get over, "the drug deal gone bad scene" it was amazing, music acting and cinematography combined to make it amazing. i hadn't seen boogie nights and thank god i did, its so well rounded and i am now a huge fan of pta (paul thomas anderson).<br /><br />do whatever you have to do and watch this movie.
