'this is not a film' works because it is so true in what it is trying to say. if you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message, you will see a little bit of yourself in the main character, michael. whether male or female, all of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship. did it really occur like we remembered? what went wrong? michael's desire to find grace is completely selfish. more than anything, he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out. but even so, he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. we would not be in them otherwise. as the film ends, i am not sure if michael has learned anything new about himself or not. our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend, nadia. she is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story. i found michael to be pompous, arrogant, and just plain clueless. which is exactly why i liked him. he is a real character. if you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship, then this is a film for you. in closing, it is a film for everyone.
