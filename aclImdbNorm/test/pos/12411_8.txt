this "tftd" episode from season one titled ironically "answer me" is a pretty well done and memorable episode, and it takes a shocking twist at the end. you have jean marsh as an over the hill and washed up actress from l.a. who's moved to new york city for an audition and she's living in an apartment provided by an old friend. oddly every night she's kept awake by a ringing phone from the next door apartment, yet oddly enough the dwelling where the ringing phone continues to ring is unoccupied as the guests have been dead for many years. finally she has to give in only she should have followed along and not answered the phone with no one home, as it's bad to get wrapped up in a phone with a life of it's own! overall good episode a strange one though about a supernatural phone still it's suspenseful and it twists well at the end.
