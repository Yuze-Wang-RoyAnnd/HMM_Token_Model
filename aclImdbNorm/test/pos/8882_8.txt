this movie is basically a spoof on hitchcock's strangers on a train, which i thought was overrated anyway. the plot has danny devito going to see strangers and then thinking billy crystal wants them to swap murders, for crystal to murder his mother and devito to murder his wife. both devito and crystal are great and so is devito's mother. this is devito's directorial debut and it's better than the war of the roses.
