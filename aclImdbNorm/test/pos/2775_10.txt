susie q is an original and isn't like those other bad disney film, ***spoiler*** a boy named zach moves to a new town and has trouble at school, he is good basketball. a girl in the 1950's died with her boyfriend, when their car was crashed off a bridge. susie (amy jo johnson) from the power rangers - pink ranger- is helping zach as a ghost to get a necklace along the way he must explain to his sister about her ghost, and finally getting this necklace, susie returns to the bridge she died on and then she gets in the ghostly car of her boyfriend and they float up. later as he misses her he finds a girl who looks just like her. (do you believe in reincarnation?)susie q is a good movie to see now and then but they barely give because disney needs to fill everything up with stupid movies and shows i give it a<br /><br />7/10
