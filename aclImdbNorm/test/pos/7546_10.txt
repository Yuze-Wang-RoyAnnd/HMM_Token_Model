this comic classic of english school girl antics is and was one of the great art house classics. then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos. and so did the audience for this movie. the loss is not to the art houses or to this great film. the loss is to those who will never have a real opportunity to view this memorable laugh filled cinematic masterpiece. but i am preaching to the converted aren't i. who else would search for this flick?
