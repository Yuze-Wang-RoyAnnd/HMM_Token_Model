ok, well, no one in their right mind(s) would pick up a movie titled "the man with the screaming brain" and expect it to be serious. this is an outrageous b-movie, and that means a truly hokey plot, strange characters, clich'es, over-the-top action, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. for that odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that kind of thing, this is a gem.<br /><br />the acting is better than expected. stacy keach is embedded in his character. bruce campbell brings a spirited, convincing performance. his physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this movie and hearken back to the "evil dead" films.
