i just watched nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and while i remember liking it at the time, i don't remember being blown away by it like i was today. i really can't complain about anything in this movie. craig scheffer is excellent as the lead character of boone. i never understood why he hasn't had a more successful career, because most of his early work is outstanding. as good as scheffer is, cronenberg is even better. his portrayal of the psycho dr. decker is unforgettable, and steals the show. the rest of the cast, which includes doug bradley is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff. the visuals are good, and in some shots great. the danny elfman composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work. the ending was epic, with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes. overall, nightbreed is a tremendous accomplishment for clive barker, and ranks as my favorite of his movies, just slightly ahead of hellraiser. 9/10
