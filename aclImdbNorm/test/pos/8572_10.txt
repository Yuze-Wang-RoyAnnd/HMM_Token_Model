i'm grading this film on a curve, in other words, it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do. this is an excellent t&a film. i have no idea the count of how many t's or a's were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had 16 bare t's at one time, just to give you an idea. there are topless girls all throughout. there is a wet t-shirt contest scene. and the climax involves a game of touch football between two all-girl teams and every time one scores a touchdown the entire opposing team losing a piece of clothes. i don't know why this gets such a low rating here. perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see citizen kane. i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones. if you are looking for a good campy t&a film i'd recommend this one.
