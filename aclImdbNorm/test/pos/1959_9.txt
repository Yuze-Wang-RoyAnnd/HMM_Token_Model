i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was, reflecting the apathy of adolescents (this was before generation "x").<br /><br />in a way, most of us are products of the same consumer culture; these high school kids spend their time drinking, getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank.<br /><br />what would they do today? would things be different?. some very important questions. there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves, and the dysfunctional family he lives with; his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted; the mother has no idea what to do- spends her time drinking with her boyfriend.<br /><br />this film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class american society; these kids had no outlet; what is available for them in this dirt-water town? . all in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented, and there are no solutions. 9/10.
