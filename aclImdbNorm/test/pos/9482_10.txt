from the opening drum hit of "we're gonna groove" to the last guitar hit of "whole lotta love", this two-dvd set might be one of the best music dvd's ever to hit the shelves since the beatles anthology was finally released earlier this year.<br /><br />one of the best things about this dvd is that on disc 1, a whole concert and many television appearances can be found. for instance, the whole royal albert hall concert is on the dvd, as well as some of the best performances from the band's last concert at knebworth.<br /><br />in the royal albert hall concert, for instance, the band had a lot of room to improvise. jimmy page's guitar solos make "dazed and confused" a huge rock power ballad as opposed to the laid-back blues song it was on led zeppelin i. <br /><br />next, on dvd 2, is a promotional video for the led zeppelin iii hit song "immigrant song". one of zeppelin's hardest rocking songs, the video is about as sketchy as a pre-mtv video was, but it displays a lot of guitar power by jimmy page, as it was taken from a live performance. after the video ends, we are treated, in transition, with a short picture of fans filling the seats at madison square garden. the following are performances that were supposed to be part of "the song remains the same", but did not make the cut. excellent riffs like those in the songs "black dog" and "the ocean" were both present.<br /><br />after the madison performances, we are treated with earl's court. most of the led zeppelin iv material was played here, like the most popular song that zeppelin ever recorded, "stairway to heaven". it is brilliant as always, even more so than the version on iv.<br /><br />finally, to end the 5+ hours of live material, is led zeppelin's final concert in knebworth in august of 1979. as the viewer watches this, they have to admit that robert plant's voice is getting throatier and deeper from all of the screaming he has done in the past, and it is evident here. on songs like "kashmir" and "in the evening", plant does not have his vocal boost of old, yet, on "whole lotta love", it returns for one more song.<br /><br />overall, one of the best musical dvd's ever released, only next to the great "beatles anthology" boxed set that was released earlier in 2003. the sound, both in 5.1 dts and 5.1 dolby digital, just like the beatles dvd, gives you a feeling of being on-stage with the performers, standing right next to them, as you would feel on the beatles dvd when they are jamming in the studio. even though the beatles and led zeppelin are different bands, though, they each received different dvd's. even though this set comes on only two discs compared to the five disc beatles set, it still feels very filling to the viewer after they have gone through all of that content. it is also a pleasure to watch again and again, not only because of the sound quality, but because of the sheer energy on stage when robert plant begins to sing.<br /><br />a brilliant effort from atlantic.
