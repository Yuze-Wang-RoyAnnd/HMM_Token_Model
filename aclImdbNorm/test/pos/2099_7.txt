like another poster mentioned ch. 56 (a local boston tv station) showed this multiple times over the years on saturday afternoons. they paired it with the first sequel "return of the ginat majin".<br /><br />now i haven't seen it since then...but it never left me. aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy. technically it isn't horror...until the statue comes to life at the end. it's just about a village ruled over by an evil man. there's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them...to no avail. but things go too far, the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guys...but then it starts going after the good guys too! well-done with some cool special effects at the end (loved how he got rid of the main bad guy). also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting too.<br /><br />no masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasy/horror film. worth catching--but not if it's the dubbed print.
