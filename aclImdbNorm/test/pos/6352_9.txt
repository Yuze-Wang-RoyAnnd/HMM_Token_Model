excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had some teeth to it without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative & artificially gratifying. might be a good double feature with american beauty as well. best performance to date that i've seen from anita mui, and every actor in this seems like a powerhouse. hats off to ann hui for the direction and ivy ho for the brilliant script. seriously one of the best dramas i've seen in a while, especially if you have a taste for classical literature ala poetry. again, excellent.
