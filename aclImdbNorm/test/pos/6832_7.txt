i got this movie from ebay mainly because i'm gay and i love til schweiger. however, it's one of those movies that, when you watch it a second time, you never say to yourself, "hmm. i forgot about this boring part. i'll go make popcorn." it doesn't have that part. it's a very fluid and constantly interesting film. and, yes, til schweiger is worth it, if nothing else. but, it's a great movie even for straight guys.
