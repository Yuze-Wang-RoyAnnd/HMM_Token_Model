i saw this movie in the early 1990's when it had been out on vhs for a little while. at the time, i found it to be interesting, and was especially struck by the ken russell segment, with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery.<br /><br />last night, at a 2nd-run showing of the latest indiana jones movie, the vision of john hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to "aria", which i had not thought of in years, and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bit.<br /><br />if i can make this observation, i note with interest the love-hate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment, and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects. some get it, others do not, interesting.<br /><br />i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways. this is how it affected and affects me.
