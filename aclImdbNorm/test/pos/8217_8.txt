the net is an excellent movie! it's about angela bennett(in a great performance of sandra bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the cathedral company, cleaning virus and testing games for the clients. angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of the cyberspace,almost doesn't take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. one day her friend dale hessman(ray mckinnon) asks her to help him,sending angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations. at the same night, when dale was going to meet her, he is suddenly killed in a plane crash.going to mexico in her vacation,angela meets a beautiful guy called jack devlin (jeremy northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the diskette.<br /><br />her life then turns into a nightmare: all her records are erased and she is given the new identity of ruth marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.<br /><br />this movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error.
