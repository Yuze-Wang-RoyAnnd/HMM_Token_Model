i saw uzumaki about a year ago and was mesmerized. the only japanese horror film i had seen before this one was kwaidan (which i proudly own on dvd, by the way), superb! the idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of lovecraft. certainly it reminds one of shadow over innsmouth, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). and who can forget the washing machine sequence? i hope we will soon see this one available on region 1 dvd (i see that sundance has recently screened it on us tv, hopefully they'll do it again very soon) so that we can all see it. highly recommended!!!!!
