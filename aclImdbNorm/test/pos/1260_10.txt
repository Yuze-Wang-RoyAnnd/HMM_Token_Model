what a film. quite possibly the best i've ever seen, the direction, the production,the score and the cinematography,absoloutley wonderful. the acting is also excellent, and the man/robot scenes have to be seen to be belieived. i can not recommend this film enough. get it out on video now, turn the lights down and enjoy.
