i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film?? its not because of money spent on it that's for sure!! did i see a painted water pistol in there? maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland? or maybe they just didn't have any money? the making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. awesome! but what i really liked was the grit of the performances. mike michell and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys. no hollywood histrionics here.<br /><br />ok, so the effects work isn't very good. the spaceships just don't look as good as they should in todays fx world and i've seen much better free stuff on youtube. but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet. was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew? or is it just better effects work? did they edit out the water? by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died.
