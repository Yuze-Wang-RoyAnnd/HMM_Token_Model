ray charles robinson (jamie foxx) is a extremely talented pianist and singer as well. ray is an smart man as well. ray started his career in the late 1940's before he finds his distinctive style. ray is certainly popular at the night clubs with his music. things changes, when he meets an ambitious music producer (curtis armstrong). who knows ray got what it takes to be an strong performer and he also meets an woman (kerry washington), he loves as well & marries along the way. ray's album becomes an hit, when he mixes soul music and gospel together. which makes ray an controversial man during in the 1950's to the 1960's. ray has love for all kind of music, including country. but ray isn't always the perfect man as he seems to be. since he had plenty of failed relationship with other woman, while he's married. but he also had to battle with racism, people who double-crossed him, his music ideals and of course, his drug addiction. which it made ray's life extremely difficult for him and as well for battling the tragedy of his childhood. which ray always blamed himself for.<br /><br />directed by oscar-winner:taylor hackford (against all odds, devil's advocate, dolores claiborne) made an fascinating true-life story of the always interesting of the late "ray charles". foxx won an oscar for his touching performance of the late entertainer. foxx brings heart and soul in the film and humour as well. but this film has plenty of rich performances by an top cast including:regina king, clifton powell, bokeem woodbine, aunjaune ellis, warwick davis, terrence howard and sharon warren as ray's mother. this is probably the best film of hackford's career to date. the film has plenty of song of charles's best music as well.<br /><br />dvd has an sharp pan & scan (1.33:1) transfer and an excellent dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the dvd also has the original theatrical cut and extended version as well. but u are better watching the theatrical version instead, because the bonus footage is in bad shape at times and u have to click on a logo if you want to see these deleted scenes. disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director (which is seen in the extended version), featurettes and more. but the featurettes are disappointingly short for this dvd. since the movie is extraordinary good. this film was nominated four oscars including best costume designs, best director, best editing and best picture. this is an amazing true-life story well told but of course, charles' life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. still, it's pretty damn close. screenplay by james l. white. from an story by white and director:hackford. oscar-winner for best sound. don't miss it.
