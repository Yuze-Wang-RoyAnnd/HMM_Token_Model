i was drawn to "friends" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston. i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called "seasons", then i found the elton john song "friends" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. anyway, the flood of the emotions of "friends" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love. i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production, plot, etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary-eyed at the end as i was. i'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. so many movies which seemed so important to me back then (i.e. "the graduate" "easy rider") now just seem silly and i don't want this to fall into the same category. but, i will find it and if it turns out silly, then at least i'll be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. when we met, we went through this with "last tango in paris". the youngsters i work with (i'm 56) respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little "aged" now. i just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. "friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. it will bring back a lot of special feelings i'm sure. by all means, rent or buy a copy... indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today.
