the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession. filmed for zero money, nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade, given the lack of funds. this short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial set-up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. the muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.<br /><br />one can easily see nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia. not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans.
