- the best bit : when the dull mobster (nicholas turturro) calls out to the runaway (matthew modine) "shane !.. come back shane !" and when the older wise guy asks him "what are you doing ?!" he replays simply "enjoying my time !" actually like me at the moment ! <br /><br />- the most creepy part : i've been wondering all the time of watching : where did i see that girl before ? where ? where ? till i found out while the closing credits.. ohh my god ! she's (elizabeth berkley) .. from the showgirls' fiasco ! but i just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on ! to tell you the truth i felt a brief tremor. she's really cute and nice but maybe hollywood had no mercy at all ! <br /><br />- the most sexy bit : when (berkley) says "do you mean the stuff which gives you a boner ?!". <br /><br />- the most dull thing : the retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !!??, moreover the mexican smuggler took 3 bullets (at the same car !) and he's not dead either !!?? <br /><br />- the most ugly thing : all of those murdered people, as well as the numerous (f) ward to a boring extent ! <br /><br />- the most beautiful thing : the crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations, the acting looked sweet also especially from (paul rodriguez) who stole the show for (as he had the best dialogue also !). <br /><br />- the most disappointing thing : although the direction didn't mess about the story's wittiness at all but in the same time it didn't give it a unique touch, a matchless signature, some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself. however maybe the low production wronged it well ! and of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too ! <br /><br />- the most confusing part : (matthew modine) is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of hollywood's "a" list of stars ?! what could possibly be the thing he made (or didn't make !) to end up in light independent jest like (the shipment) ?!! <br /><br />- the most absent scene : where did (jose) the mexican smuggler go at last ?! i thought that we'll see him again at the end, smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who, in a brief gimmick like this, could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world. <br /><br />- the most question i had after the end : when we'll see (the shipment - 2) ? as i'm so eager to see that fine small comic hurly-burly atmosphere again ! <br /><br />these were my own answers. if you interested in giving answers of your own for this questionnaire, please e-mail me.
