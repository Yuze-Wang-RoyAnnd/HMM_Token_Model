while escaping from a heist of a bank, the outlaw vance shaw (randolph scott) helps edward creighton (dean jagger), the chief-engineer of the western union that is surveying the wild west and had had an accident with a horse. in 1861, vance regenerates and is hired to work for the western union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from omaha to salt lake city. vance and the engineer from harvard richard blake (robert young) flirt with the gorgeous edward's sister sue creighton (virginia gilmore) and she chooses vance. however, his past haunts him when the outlaw jack slade (barton maclane) steals the western union cattle disguised of indians.<br /><br />"western union" is a good but predictable western directed by fritz lang. the story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the west, facing thieves and indians. the entertaining story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of the identity of jack slade, there is no surprise in the story. randolph scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "os conquistadores" ("the conquerors")
