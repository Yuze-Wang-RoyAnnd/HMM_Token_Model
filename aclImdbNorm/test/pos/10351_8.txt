i was blubbing like an idiot during the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television. i have to say that the idea of sitting down to view 90 minutes of what was bound to be pretty depressing material on a sunday, was not a welcome one. the thought of yet another, over worthy, bafta winning possibility did not enthuse me......however the end result knocked me for 6. this is some of the best television i have seen in ages. for years i was under the impression that all originality had left the bbc's drama department. our friends in the north was the last production that truly blew me away and that was 10 years ago. however faith is restored and honour is satisfied. david tenant was incredible! so many actors i can think of would have really gone to town on a part like this, but never once did i see mr tenant as an actor or as the doctor, all i saw was alan hamilton. i haven't had my heart wrenched this much since daniel craigs performance as geordie peacock all those years ago. sarah parish was also incredible and i really hope this role brings her better roles in the future. all of the cast were great but special mention must go to the director who really placed us inside alans head. the toaster scene, in particular, made me feel quite queasy.
