now, i'm a bit biased, since i'm a big fan of late night television. i've been a loyal fan of jay leno for about 6 or 7 years, and think he's one of the funniest, most talented comedians out there. and david letterman is one hell of a comedian as well, though i only watch his show (unless jay's a repeat) during commercials or when he has a better guest than jay on the show. daniel roebuck and john michael higgins are both fine actors and they very much resembled jay and dave, but did they disappear into the characters? nope. roebuck barely nails down jay's voice and expression, mumbling at a high pitch, sounding like a castrati marlon brando. higgins nails down david's facial expressions (for example, his trademark squirm) but he doesn't nail down dave's voice. those who aren't big fans of late night tv might be a lot less biased. there's a couple comedians who can do dead-on impersonations of jay. why couldn't they have selected one of them for the part? and the same goes with dave. i'd rather they had norm mcdonald play the part. norm doesn't look a hell of a lot like dave, but he did a great impersonation of him on snl. "hey...you got any gum?" that was so hilarious!<br /><br />however, i learned a lot about the late night wars which i had very little knowledge of at first. i never watched "the tonight show" prior to when jay leno was host, so i didn't know about the struggle to finally replace johnny carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced dave to move to cbs. i knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening. and kathy bates gives a knockout performance as the foul-mouthed former executive producer of "the tonight show." she basically steals the film. <br /><br />my score: 7 (out of 10) <br /><br />
