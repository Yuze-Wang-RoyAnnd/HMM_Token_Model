the psychopath (1973) a trip down memory lane. i saw this film many years ago on a old black and white t.v. a children's' show host mr. rabbey avenges the brutal abuse that parents inflict upon his kiddie fans. mr. rabbey (who looks like he's always on the verge of losing it) finally cracks and decides to go on a hunting trip. watch out bad parents cause mr. rabbey is on the prowl! what happens next is priceless. however, trying to find this movie will be quite a chore.<br /><br />what makes this film notable was the fact that joe "maniac" spinell made a short promo reel for a film based upon this one. in his unfinished film, he plays mr. robbie, a t.v. clown(who looks like a pudgy out of shape edward james olmos) who avenges his young fans child abuse by going after their parents. sadly, mr. spinell could never find the funds to complete the project. the film was going to be titled maniac ii: "mister robbie". rabbey or robbie the similarities are all too close for comfort. pretty violent for a p.g. movie.<br /><br />recommended.
