pat o'brien had his best role ever as notre dame football coach knute rockne. from humble beginnings, rockne entered notre dame as a student circa 1910. he is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero.<br /><br />upon graduation, he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that tugs at him, this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game. in a way, too bad, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher-certainly far better and nicer than the one i had in high school. (erasmus hall in brooklyn to be exact.)<br /><br />he motivates his students. he will not tolerate academic underachievement. he is a coach for all seasons.<br /><br />o'brien captures that common kind touch. one of his students, george gipp, is memorably played in a fine brief supporting performance by ronald reagan.<br /><br />the years pass and the achievements run high-but knute remains the same kind coach who testifies before congress when football is called into question.<br /><br />donald crisp is outstanding as a notre dame priest who knew that rockne was destined to coach football. albert basserman is adequate, but his jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best. basserman was nominated that year in the supporting category for "foreign correspondent."<br /><br />rockne's tragic death, in a plane crash, robbed the world of many more years of a totally professionally wonderful human-being. the film is great.
