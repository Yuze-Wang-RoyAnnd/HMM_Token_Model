quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film. if you are interested in film history, to truly understand the innovations eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing potemkin along side most any film made before it (those of d.w. griffith offer a good contrast). it should be allowed that eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time. however, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium.<br /><br />if you are not interested in that sort of thing, potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. you should see it, buy it, and tatoo it to your chest.
