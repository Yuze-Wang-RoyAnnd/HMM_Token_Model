central airport is the story of a pilot named jim (richard barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. he meets a beautiful girl named jill (sally eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. the two start a relationship, but when jim is hurt, his brother (tom brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. from there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.<br /><br />this film is a pre-code because of several reasons. first, jim and jill have consummated their relationship without being married and with no intention of having a wedding. second, eilers is shown in her underwear, and absolutely restricted scene when the production code came into effect.<br /><br />this film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and in consequence ends bittersweetly.
