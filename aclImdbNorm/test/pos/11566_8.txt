i used to watch this show when i was growing up. when i think about it, i remember it very well. if you ask me, it was a good show. two things i remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. the writing was also very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i haven't seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
