american war movie fans might be bored out of their skulls by this movie, but that boredom is born of ignorance. guerrilla suppression operations are always like that. sit around and wait, get some hookers, get drunk at the base, wheel and deal with the businessman, kick a prisoner around, cover up the killing of the street merchant by the green private. then, boom, there goes two fuel trucks, and for 10 minutes a small-arms battle with one high-caliber machine gun. then wait for brass to plan a way to knock out their stronghold, and then end up killing a few civilians in the process of doing it. if reality doesn't work for western viewers, there's always top gun or rambo (top gun realistic? nope)<br /><br />the best part of afganskiy izlom's realism was the way all the planes dropped flares like confetti. they had to do that because carter and reagan gave the mujahedin so many missiles. also, the wave of mi-24's was excellent, a better helo attack even than apocalypse now. the sight of their missiles dropping and shooting was a scene of impending "death from above" for whoever they were aimed at.<br /><br />it's funny how the soviets were able to make an honest afghanistan movie within a year after their departure, but it took the us six years. afganskiy izlom is just as real if you apply it to nato's occupation too. someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you cause they care more about the land. it's a movie westerners should watch. unfortunately i don't think anyone has ever made english subtitles; i might have to make some.
