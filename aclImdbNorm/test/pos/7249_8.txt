so it might not be entirely historically accurate. and there is little or no real character development. but for jake (son of ridley) scott's first attempt, it's well worth the ticket price.<br /><br />captain james macleane (jonny lee miller looking as good as ever) may be a gentleman, but he hasn't got the money or the clothes to prove it. plunkett (robert carlyle with all his clothes on) is an apothecary-turned-outlaw. the circumstances of their strange meeting involve a dead body, a ruby, and eventually a partnership as the gentlemen highwaymen. as the tag line says, "they rob the rich... and that's it." there isn't really much background, or even in-depth development, but the object seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the two highwaymen's passage to america. one small problem: macleane falls in love. with the chief justice's ward, rebecca (liv tyler). who happens to also have caught the eye of the thief taker general.<br /><br />the plot is original enough, the casting is excellent (especially alan cumming as the drag-queenish lord rochester, carlyle and miller--also together in "trainspotting," they haven't lost their dynamic), the costuming is fantastic, the makeup is outrageous, and the music is hard-edged techno with a strangely classical undertone. jake scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good sense of balance between spectacle and plot, and he isn't squeamish about showing the more unpleasant side of 17th century london. and lucky for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially eyes. jonny lee miller's eyes. and liv tyler's, too, but hey, who is this movie about? rebecca? no. plunkett and macleane. but there's more to this movie than just pretty faces. at the risk of sounding cliche, it's a fast, furious, and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble highwaymen since robin hood. decadent, sleazy, and violent, scott's debut film makes for an entertaining evening at the movies.<br /><br />as macleane says, "i was terrific, and it was a bloody good laugh!"
