i never saw any of the league's work until early last year - although when channel hopping one night i caught the end of one the series three episodes. but last winter i fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters. so when i learnt they had made a film in which the show's lovable creators met their own characters, i couldn't order the dvd fast enough and near on tore it from my postman's hands when he delivered it. i was so excited to see what the gents had done and how they'd done it.<br /><br />and it was excellent! from the beginning where jeremy (michael sheen) is terrorised by edward, tubbs and papa (dyson, why didn't you play yourself? he's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous highgate house of horrors know!), to bernice berating yet another one of her flock, to geoff, herr lipp and hilary discovering that they are characters, which is a great scene. the scenes set in 1690 are very enjoyable, with the gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot. david warner's turn as doctor pea is fantastic, slightly camp and very funny.<br /><br />the league have always been brilliant at blending humour with sadness and emotion - and the climax of this film, where herr lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose - and to witness how it's breaking him down, is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the gents' talent - something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day.<br /><br />and then you have that rather clever ending - where you sit in wonder - with joby talbot's beautiful theme music playing. and you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film.
