it's also the best book i've ever read. karl urban and steve zahn are great together. it had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. i laughed. i cried. it's hard not to laugh when gus is talking. i wish gus would have smacked clara like he did inez. clara just lead gus on all those years with no intentions of ever marrying him. she just liked playing with him. it was sad that he spent his whole life pining for her. it would have been nice if woodrow had married maggie but she would have just died on him anyway. woodrow was a man that could not express his feelings and kept them bottled up. it was obvious that he loved maggie after the raid on austin when the rangers got back and he ran to hold her. val kilmer is excellent at playing odd characters. i loved his portrayal of captian inish skull. i loved the whole lonesome dove saga. comanche moon is the best of the bunch.
