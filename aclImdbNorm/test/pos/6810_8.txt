i saw this 1997 movie because i am a fan of lorenzo lamas (and of his father, the late fernando lamas). in my opinion, lorenzo looked his best in this film, mostly due to his hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that were flattering to him.<br /><br />as the plot progressed, i realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. the story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. there was adequate suspense, and i believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer.<br /><br />at the end of the film i was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in utah. furthermore, lorenzo and his leading lady were portraying actual fbi agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the ring. i believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.
