first of all i have to say that i'm a huge lucio fulci and dario argento fan. although i have not seen absolutely all of their movies, i really enjoyed almost every one i did see. i really like giallos and i thought argento was the master of this genre, after seeing films like "tenebre" and "phenomena". but after i saw "new york ripper" by fulci, i found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo argento, on a certain level.<br /><br />i love fulci's style, and yes i love gore, but this film i think, although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films, is not his best one. what i don't like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end. and the fact that we go from one suspect, to another, and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment, i think it goes too far. i know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end, and the killer should be very hard to find, but this film plays a little too much with our minds. however i did like the scene when the witch is killed, i think it is very well done and gave me the chills. the acting is also pretty good and the photography is great.<br /><br />although this is not a bad film, i think lucio fulci has made better films than this, and i think his best one is "the beyond", a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience.<br /><br />i give "don't torture a duckling" a 7 out of 10.<br /><br />
