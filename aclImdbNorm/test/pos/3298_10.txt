had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award. and i have to say, it was well deserved because boy next door is a very funny short film! the script is well written and keeps things escalating. it also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. you don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. the jokes are quick and unexpected. the plot keeps us guessing. the dialog feels very real. i thought the direction was first-rate and the director travis davis shows a lot of potential for making it big in the world of studio comedies. not small praise considering he also is the lead actor of the film, so he had to do triple duty on this, writing, directing and starring. if you get a chance to see this film on itunes, it's worth the download. it'll make you laugh out loud a few times. and that's more than most shorts offer these days.
