my taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and i have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and see no evil happens to be exactly that and more!! i think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a wwe film and "starring" kane. wwe might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park "sport" and those who don't love it haattte it!! it would make them steer clear of an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out in droves to see. see no evil doesn't break any new horror ground, it's exactly play by play typical horror with some over the top, horrific bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl. they really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause. there is no psychological aspect exactly although being chased by this monster has some fear elements to it.<br /><br />kane (the wrestler) also known as glen jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man jacob goodnight. he's the ultimate cross between leatherface, and jason voorhees. he's not an original killer and even his kills don't really go for the unique or original with the major exception of choking a girl to death by forcing her to swallower her cell phone...yeeeeah!! he does a good job and the man is legitimately enormous!! he stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous!! tiffany lamb, penny mcnamee, samantha noble, michael j. pagan, luke pegler, christina vidal, rachael taylor all play the typical group of "think they are invincible" partying teens who will unwillingly become victim to the serial killer. the story is that in exchange for a month off their detention sentence for petty crimes ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do "community service " by fixing it up. turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and he's removing his victims eyes to cleanse them of their sins. luke pegler stands out as a scum bag who in the end becomes a hero of sorts even saving his ex-girlfriend who he used to beat up on. the rest of them all play their perspective roles quite well but it isn't a great stretch of acting ability.<br /><br />sadly porn director...yes porn...gregory dark, does a good job putting together the modern day slasher flick. he even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique either, in fact it's a little stale it's still interesting enough. and in the few shots where the film goer is actually seeing through the killer's eyes, it's interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted like he does. he throws in the obligatory soft core nude shot, and the grotesque, blood soaked scenes and turns everything up a notch. it fits nicely and for a horror fan like myself it's entertaining. kane's serial killer is horrifying and he stalks them all down with brutal intelligence and a silent horror. the film is being panned and crapped on and i don't blame anyone because it's pretty crappy but isn't that the point?? it's a horror film and i thought it was exactly what it should be. it made me jump, it made me cringe, it even made me turn away at several parts...impressive by any standards. it's entertaining, with a decent story, and plenty of set up to serialize see no evil until the 15th installment if they wanted to and i say bring it on!! it's true the film is full of plot holes, laughable details but the deadly gore and horror over rides it all. it all comes down to do you love horror films?? really love them?? if yes then you'll think this is a terrific slasher...if not...you'll hate it...plain and simple. 8.5/10
