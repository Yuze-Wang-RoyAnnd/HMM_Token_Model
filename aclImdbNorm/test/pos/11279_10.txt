what this movie is not: cool, entertaining<br /><br />what this movie is: visually interesting, difficult to get through, intentional<br /><br />i feel that this movie puts the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a clip of time where they experience a world without language. much like how animals must experience the world. you don't really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what "feels" like real time.<br /><br />consistently, it goes on much longer than is comfortable. this movie could be edited down to a 20 minute short and it would be a totally different movie. it would be cool and entertaining, but the experience would be lost. i have seen a lot of cool movies, but i have never experienced one like this. if you can get your head in the right place for this one, you should be able to really appreciate (but likely not "enjoy") what they accomplished here. 10 out of 10.
