"rush in rio" is, no doubt, one of the most exciting dvds i have purchased. although i am a biased rush fan of almost 20 years, i found this performance to be flawless. the music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile... it's like they were able to capture every concert i've been to. for any rush fan, this dvd is a must; if anything, just to see the "boys in brazil" documentary (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). for any non-rush fan, this dvd is an enjoyable concert. rush fans know the talent of these three canadians. we have rather firmly stood by them for years. i've shown this dvd (or portions of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of rush, or those who think rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (i.e., sex, drugs, and a drunken frenzy). the bottom line is this dvd is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it.
