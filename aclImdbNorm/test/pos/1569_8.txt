while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (i thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi, home movie feel) i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent! dean bell has crafted a real gem that judith ivey charms with character-driven delight. her performance of sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. we are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open. emily grace's alice is infused with a doey-eyed magic. she seems to mold like clay before us, morphing into some sort of beautiful, lost beast. by the end, we are at odds with words, as she is, saying goodbye to her mother. kudos also should be doled out to jane lincoln taylor -- whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight -- and justin parkinson -- whose shy first-time john, sam, provides one of the sweetest, if not most awkward, sex scenes in film. bell has created a first rate story and assembled a plethora of talent to make it.
