l'ossessa, also known as the tormented or the sexorcist, or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show, is a forgotten exorcist rip-off which contains one of the best horror moments i've ever seen. the scene is when the crucifix comes alive. this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great fxs). it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene.<br /><br />this is one of the most frustrating movies ever. imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possessed sculpture of crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist rip-off. had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc), this film would have rocked. but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. she, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is stupid!!!<br /><br />if you like so-called "euro-cult" movies, the first 45 minutes deliver unlike any other euro-cult movies. but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmatas, the remaining 45 minutes suck. boring. it goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate (badly) the exorcist. so, watch the first 45 minutes of l'ossessa and enjoy the 1970s fashions, the sleaze and the amazing statue-comes-alive-to-ravish-the-girl scene but after the first 45 minutes, press stop and eject, and might as well go clip your toenails.
