this this coming of age dramedy set in chicago in the early 60's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. the two central characters are leroy "preach" jackson (turman) and his best friend richard "cochise" morris (hilton-jacobs.) both of these boys have promising futures. preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. when they're not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends.<br /><br />things go wrong when preach and cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. the police pursue them and they are arrested. but thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (snl's garrett morris) they are released. but the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on preach and cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them.<br /><br />this movie is very episodic, but it still works because thats what life is, a series of episodes. some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. the film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. like preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, or dealing with a bratty younger sibling. but even when a situation isn't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.<br /><br />'cooley high' was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom 'what's happenin!' which aired on abc from 1976-1979. even though the show is most famous for the character rerun, he is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. the humor of that show was very broad, but still funny. the humor of 'cooley high' is truer to life, and thus more entertaining.<br /><br />additionally, the soundtrack is wonderful. classic songs from that period by diana ross & the supremes, the temptations, martha & the vandellas, and smokey robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant tone of the film.
