although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer. this remains the best film made about custer. the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song "gerry owen", which was a favourite of custer is played. the film should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy. the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together, and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best.
