just saw this film the other day at the santa fe film festival. i was delighted by its honesty and humor. it was the most thought provoking movie i've seen in a very long time -- i just can't get it off of my mind for some reason. it may not be for everyone, because it makes you think. i don't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore, which is a shame. the actors who play the franklins are quite a find. i couldn't imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness. though i thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the franklins, i can totally forgive it -- because this is an important movie in my opinion. i didn't expect to like it so much, but as i've thought about it for a few days, it's proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment.
