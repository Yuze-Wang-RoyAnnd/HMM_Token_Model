not a bad movie but could have been done without the full frontal nudity of a 10 year old boy in one of the opening scenes. this movie has excellent dialog; which is certainly common among foreign films. foreign actors still know how to act as opposed to american actors who let the cgi, stunts, and special effects do all the work for them. this film is just good old fashion acting. gerarde depardieux did an excellent job as always. the costumes and scenery are accurate with the time. my only complaint is that they should have dubbed the english words over the french instead of using subtitles; this could just be because i hate reading subtitles.
