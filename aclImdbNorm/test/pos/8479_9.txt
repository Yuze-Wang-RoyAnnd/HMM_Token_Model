a lecture over the life of the tormented magician named ray charles. his pulses on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool tunes. each barrier that ray was facing never kept him down, and he found his way all over conflicts. a real lesson. a great team of producers help recreate the era and armed with great costumes, hairs and settings one will follow ray's story believing its true, direct filming! an icy music freezes and goosebumps the audience with clever sound editing. but, the most important part of the movie is jamie foxx. his acting is really superb, the most diamond polished acting ever seen. he lives his role. he is the ray of light.
