i viewed linda, and it is a top-rate movie! the lives of paul and his wife, linda, who he adored as a young man and finally married. they meet another married couple, jeff and stella, and the foursome become very good friends. but, their friendship takes a twisted turn after vacationing together at varona beach....a twist that never returns the married couples to their former status as friends.<br /><br />linda is a must-see!!!! the acting by virginia madsen is acceptable; however, richard thomas steals the movie with his incredible acting...and the emotions that he displays.<br /><br />a wonderful movie!
