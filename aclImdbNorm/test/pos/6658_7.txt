well, i expected, for all the hype and oscar nominations, an epic civil war drama (& something with the "magnitude" of the "english patient" given the same director). this film isn't of epic stature, but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't. it's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone.<br /><br />anyway i thought nicole kidman and rene zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about jude law, he was all right, also. it seems rene z. had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited, feisty downhome woman with much aplomb. also for me it was good to see actress, kathy baker...someone's who's talent needs to be more recognized/acknowledged.<br /><br />this film is worth seeing this -- i'm can't articulate why really, but maybe because it is a slice of americana. <br /><br />
