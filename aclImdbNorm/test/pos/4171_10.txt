wow. we watched this film in the hopes that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes. we were disappointed there, but it was still a great movie! it was soooo cheesy it was great! i haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time. if you are into rock climbing, and you enjoy cheesy movies, then this one is absolutely for you!
