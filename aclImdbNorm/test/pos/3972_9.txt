from the creators of bruce almighty and liar liar! the film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as i expected this was a run-along america pie flick. but it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his own college, running it accordingly. as you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. bartleby gaines (justin long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.' the humour was varied which i loved. all the cast delivered fantastic performances-- hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up!
