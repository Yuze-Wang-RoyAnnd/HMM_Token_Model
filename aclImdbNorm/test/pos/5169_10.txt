this movie is my families favorite christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what christmas is really all about. these days living in a big city which i hate, i love to watch movies about the life i've always dreamed of having. the town that this movie is set in is my dream come true for the life i've always wanted and the true feeling of community that has been lost in todays society. i truly don't feel the true spirit of christmas anymore but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again. my family taped this movie long ago of tv and now our copy has been worn out so i would really like to buy a few copies on dvd for my family and me if anyone can tell me where i can buy some copies please just post the info here and i will keep checking. thanks.
