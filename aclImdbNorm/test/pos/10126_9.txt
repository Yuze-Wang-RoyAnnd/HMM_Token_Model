this is a movie you'll either love or hate. i loved it. if you are looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc. you won't find it in this movie. it is a feel good movie, sentimental, positive, uplifting. the heroes of the movie are coach jones (played by ed harris), a man of strength and integrity, and radio (cuba gooding, jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. i guess i didn't find this movie to be "sentimental hogwash" as so many did, because it felt very real to me. i know people like these. i've seen jocks who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable. i've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. i've seen people who think high school football is serious business. i've seen people who know what really is important in life. any of these people could have been people i knew. i did laugh; i did cry. i left the movie feeling good, remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world. if there aren't people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. if you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature, you'll hate it.
