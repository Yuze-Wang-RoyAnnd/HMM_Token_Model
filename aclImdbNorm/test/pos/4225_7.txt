this new installment to the child's play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing chucky giveing him the finger and saying "rude f--king doll" and lots of references to the series: "you can kill me but i'll come back. i always come back". the movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. this is totally different from all other films in the series. it doesn't even have andy, the central character for all the previous ones. chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie, a soap opera about two teens running off together to get married. there is one cool elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water spilling everywhere. the movie is very gory, very funny, and has pop culture references from martha stewert to jerry springer. do not see this one before you see the other three,. it will really ruin the effect since the first one is truly scary. lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness. <br /><br />
