despite myself, i really kinda like this movie. pauley shore is invariably laugh-out-loud funny, and here is no exception. he is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold.<br /><br />his performance in this, although nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good, it seems to lift other cast members' performances. perhaps this is because he's the kind of guy it's easy to bounce off of.<br /><br />the clich'es about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way shore's "city boy", crawl is so at odds with the way of life, is funny too, but it's not only he who's a fish out of water; comedy also comes from the fact, that to any "ordinary" person or people, crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person. that's why this movie works in such a great way: we love crawl, he's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathise with the warners. he is one hell of a culture shock.<br /><br />although this movie is classic pauley shore, so there's no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie, enjoy it you do, and there's even a "never judge a book by it's cover" type moral here somewhere. not bad, not bad at all.
