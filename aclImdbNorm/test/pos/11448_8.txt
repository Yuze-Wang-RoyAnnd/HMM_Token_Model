the eighties produced a lot of gory little horror flicks, most of them within the slasher sub genre - thus putting this film ahead of most of the rest of its ilk. night of the demons is something of a cross between the ultimate gore film, the evil dead; and haunted house-cum-slash flick hell night. films like this usually feature a deranged/deformed madman as the lead bad guy; but here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me. there's also a lot of comedy in this film, and the first third of the movie could easily be the set up for a straight comedy film. but once the characters enter the central location; a sinister funeral home known as 'hull house' - the film morphs into the horror film that you would expect given the title. the plot line is as simple as you'd expect it to be, and we follow a bunch of kids that decide to put on a halloween party inside said funeral home. this turns out to be a bad idea, however, once it transpires that the house is possessed; and the demons start to inhabit the kids' bodies! their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream...but finding the gate to the grounds isn't as easy as it sounds.<br /><br />the film's centrepiece is the gothic mansion where the action takes place. this creaky old house makes for a great horror film location; the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this. director kevin tenney shoots the house well, and a particularly good job is done of establishing the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult. the comedy towards the start of the film is generally very funny, and i was hoping it would keep up the laughs once the horror starts. the film does have its comedy moments when the kids enter hull house, but it's never overly funny and it's obvious that horror is the film's main aim. not that this is a problem; but the night of the demons could have been a lot better had it fused these elements properly. the characters are pretty much what you'd expect from this sort of film; but the acting suits the movie well, and it's clear that the young cast had a good time making this movie and it translates well to the screen. the effects are good in that they suit the film well, and as most of the death sequences are well executed; it's a good bet that most people won't get bored watching this. this isn't a classic or must see film; but i can highly recommend it as it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of silly horror fodder.
