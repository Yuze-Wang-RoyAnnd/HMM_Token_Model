let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life. i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80's, which the decline of western civilization documents, with the exception of x and black flag, being more of new york and english punk guy. after i saw this movie that completely changed. the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic, strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street-cree through their lifestyles, but it is a great display of hedonism at it's best, coupled with some fun, loud rock n roll. one of the best scenes, and actually most insightful, is the interview with claude bessy of catholic discipline, or 'kick-boy' as he was known to slash magazine readers. originally from france, he rants about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk, or diy, attitude to music, politics, and life in general. darby crash of the germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time, but the germs' performance of manimal is pretty decent, complete with a young pat smear. black flag's performance with chavo pederast on vocals (it was filmed a couple of years before henry rollins joined the band) is decent, and x and fear give the best performances in the movie. look out for the interviews with the young punk kids. you'll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary. highly recommended.
