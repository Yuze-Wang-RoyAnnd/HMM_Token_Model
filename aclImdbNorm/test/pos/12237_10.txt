i think that this is a fabulous movie... i watched it constantly from the time i was 4 to about the time i was 8... however, watching it resulted in many nightmares. i particularly got them because of the guy that was always like "the otherworld" and his friends. i am 12, and i still get nightmares about it to this day. i can't fall asleep right now because i am thinking about it. i love this movie, but it is so scary! i definitely love this movie though, i have very good memories from it. kate is very good at acting in this movie. amazingly, i never realized that it was her! i also think that the graphics were very high quality, contrary to what some other people think
