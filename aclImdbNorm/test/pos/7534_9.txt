a stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in japan, like grains of sand delves into issues such as rape, homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way. it gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent's generation, with it's strict conformity and facade. typical to japanese cinema, often what isn't said is more important that what is, so to those not versed in japanese film and culture, beware. it can seem dull and minimalistic (pretty much like every film to come out of japan bar mangas) if you don't know what to look for. i saw it for the first time when i was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in japan, it's culture and language. considering i'm now 22 and learning japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, needless to say it's a powerful film. enjoy!
