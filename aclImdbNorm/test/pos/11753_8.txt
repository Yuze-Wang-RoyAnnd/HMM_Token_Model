holden and jones sizzle in this movie, but not in the way we think of sizzling today -- it's very subtle and under the surface -- yet palpable. jennifer jones, in particular, is so sexually hot in this film (much more than a caricature like monroe ever was) because she creates a real woman -- with all facets of womanhood: she's intelligent, intuitive, graceful. she's desiring and desirable. <br /><br />there's a scene on that famous hill, where she's lying down in the grass, looking up at holden, and the expression in her eyes is x-rated, yet in the context of the scene and character, in makes complete sense. you don't need to have it all said in the dialogue -- spelled-out like the crude obviousness in most modern films. it's all there in her eyes -- sexy yet elegant. what a stunning, under-rated actress she was. (i saw her madame bovary for the first time recently and was equally blown away.) i'll take her over bergman, davis, or the two hepburns any day.
