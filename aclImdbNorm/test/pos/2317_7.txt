this film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. the misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.<br /><br />hilarity ensues.<br /><br />like the "police academy" films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. i thought it was an engaging film and i will stop to watch it anytime it is on tv. no, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes. plus, lauren holly looks hot in a naval uniform.
