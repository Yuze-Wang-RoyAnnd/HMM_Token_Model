one way or the other, you can't get away from the basic message. the strong survive. those who are psychically or emotionally sensitive, leave. they leave a hole behind in the lives of those who love them. a hole that is seen in it's finality as selfish. that's what phoebe realizes in the end. just prior to helping wolf heal from his self-blame. she can accept closure to the missing ...of her sister. beautiful european scenery. a lot of truth in it about idealism and addiction to the next big moment. for a moment, i thought of the baader-meinhoff gang who was around in the early 70s. i liked this movie as it reflected a time when i came of age myself.
