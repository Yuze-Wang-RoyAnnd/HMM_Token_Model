the 20th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as "mediocre" or poor in quality, but it is a great movie.<br /><br />too bad that "the aristocats" doesn't get the deserved credit. i personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics.<br /><br />despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest disney classics. it is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments.<br /><br />edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief. he's one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny.<br /><br />every scene with edgar and the hound dogs napoleon and lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see, especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. that is hysterical!<br /><br />but the classic humor doesn't just come from edgar or the hound dogs. other characters have their moments as well.<br /><br />about the quality subject, it isn't perfect, but remains on a high level. even after walt disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to walt's spirit and "the aristocats" is one of those examples. they don't make them like this nowadays!<br /><br />as usual, legendary disney actors voice the characters. in this case, we have phil harris, sterling holloway, paul winchell, eva gabor and pat buttram.<br /><br />the characters are cool in general: thomas o'malley, duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse roquefort, the alley cats, the english geese, the hound dogs and the horse. the human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired opera singer madame adelaide bonfamille, the comic madame's old lawyer georges hautecourt and edgar himself!<br /><br />about the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas o'malley's theme (but i can't remember its name), "everybody wants to be a cat" and "the aristocats" (sung by maurice chevalier), for example.<br /><br />this movie takes place in paris (france), in the year of 1910. above all, this is a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. a timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy.<br /><br />this should definitely be on top 250.
