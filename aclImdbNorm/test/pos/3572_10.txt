bluff i really think this movie is very good.<br /><br />is basic a different kind of colombian movie. is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.<br /><br />it shows a different face o bogot'a and i think that's very important because colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world this is the first movie of the director felipe martinez and i really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.<br /><br />we need to continue support colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.
