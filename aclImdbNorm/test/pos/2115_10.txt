this is the kind of movie that i grew up on. it is great family fun, that the kids love and the parents enjoy as well. i wish more films like this were made. it's a great story about a little boy who raises a bull with his mother and sister, and shows it all the way up to the national grand championship, where he wins! then he's scared that someone's going to barbecue his bull, so he kidnaps it and heads home with it. i was really excited when i first saw this film in the theater and was surprised to see george strait, julia roberts and bruce willis in this little film. the music was great with all kinds of huge country names like willie nelson and the dixie chicks. anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie, doesn't have any children or never was a kid them self.
