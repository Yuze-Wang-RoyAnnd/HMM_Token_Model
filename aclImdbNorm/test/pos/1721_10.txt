first off, i have been a fan of the show back when my pbs station started showing it back in 1981. i learned many things about the show and the people who were in or contributed to the show.<br /><br />this latest installment of doctor who made a great impression on me. the original series, aka classic series, was made fun of by the bad special effects and/or wobbly sets. well, this is no more true. the special effects are awesome, but what is even better is the writing. you get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much. without giving too much away, it is a very worthwhile series to watch. christopher eccelston brought a side of the doctor that we never get to see, a bitter and angry one but yet lovable at the same time.<br /><br />a must see!
