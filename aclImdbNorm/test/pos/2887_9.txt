admittedly alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (for me) the greatest rock trio, ever. i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd to any fan.<br /><br />i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent munich gig (logistics) and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere. the dvd is a small consolation - the greatest incentive to acquire a proper dvd playback setup.<br /><br />naive perhaps, but i still don't understand the significance of the tumble-driers on-stage; i would be grateful for any clarification.<br /><br />cheers, iain.
