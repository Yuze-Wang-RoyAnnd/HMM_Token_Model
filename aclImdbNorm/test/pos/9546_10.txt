i am salivating for the sequels. i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension, anxiety (what if it isn't as good?!), and constant lack of information. i needed something to calm me a little, something to pass the time, other than, of course, the matrix. this was just the thing.<br /><br /> i found it informative (like the part about keanu's neck...) and some of it was funny. i pitied carrie-anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. i found only one problem with it. given that 95% of the people there were as a matter of fact male, they just kinda let their mouths run wild, and there was language in it. it's not near as bad as the shawshank redemption's cussing runs, but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day, plug your ears if you are little. ><br /><br />it was entertaining and was just what i needed. it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet. they mention a tiny bit about the sequels, and someone almost gives something away, but he catches himself in time (shoot!). it gives you almost no spoilers, but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me.<br /><br /> there is no spoon.
