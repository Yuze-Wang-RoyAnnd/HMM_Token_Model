this happened to be just starting on tv when i opened it, and as i felt too lazy to change the channel, i ended up watching it. man, was that fortunate.<br /><br />this film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama, and at times openly sentimental one. it is definitely what one could call a feel-good movie, and i usually find such either boring or irritating. yet this film is so very well done i could not help but love it. the script will not twist your brain; it is conventional, but flawless. the actors are brilliant, every single one is a perfect fit for the role. there is not much of a score, but the bits of music enhance the movie beautifully.<br /><br />if you can appreciate other things than expensive pyrotechnics, vicious murders or saving the world in a movie, do watch this if you ever have the chance. 5/5
