watching "plots with a view" (called "undertaking betty" in the us), i got the feeling that there need to be more movies filmed in wales. this one portrays a woman (brenda blethyn) in a small welsh town trying to get away from her cheating husband. so, she and the funeral parlor manager (alfred molina) come up with a plan...but there are likely to be some glitches along the way.<br /><br />i would actually say that christopher walken's character is the neatest in the movie (how could he not be?). but overall, the whole idea is just a really neat one, stacked with some "uh oh" moments...especially the haunted house scene. it's the sort of movie that i wish that i could enter, just to experience it.<br /><br />also starring lee evans, naomi watts and miriam margoyles.
