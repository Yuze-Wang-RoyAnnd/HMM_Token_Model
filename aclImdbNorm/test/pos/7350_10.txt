i love love love this show. whether you say it's because i'm insane in the brain or not. i think this show is very funny and entertaining although sometimes bam's uncle vito scares me.. so all in all i give this show a perfect review. and so i really think if you're into the "omg.. what an idiot " kind of humor, this show is for you. it's really funny to see the look on the prank peoples faces and there are many musical guests who come to bam's house. buy this cause it rocks! you should buy it. yes. and bam's brother is in the band cky and they are really good and sometimes come on the show.<br /><br />bottom line is.. please watch the show.
