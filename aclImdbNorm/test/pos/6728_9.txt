this film has "haunted" me since i saw it when i was about 8 years old. i didn't know what it was called so am so pleased to have tracked it down finally. i remember being quite scared, because i'd just been to a tin mine in cornwall when i watched it, so could imagine it all. fortunately i didn't see any ghosts of dead children there, but i found this film really quite disturbing and scary when i was much younger. i've certainly never forgotten it, even though i couldn't find it anywhere. i seem to remember the children's film foundation films being generally good, but they don't show them at all any more. i also remember programmes like the children of green knowe in the same era on bbc - equally unsettling in its own way.
