out of all the parodies of star wars i've seen, this is probably the funniest. not because of the premise, star wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of how poorly acted it is. this is purposely overacted, and it makes it hilarious, and since everyone knows its purposely overacted, no one complains. the special effects were also purposely as awful as can be, and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast, and an egg beater on a string. this short is funny for any fan of star wars (which i'm not), or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill. great short!! <br /><br />my rating: *** out of ****. 13 mins. not rated.
