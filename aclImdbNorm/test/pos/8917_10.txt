don't be fooled: this isn't yet another tired example of the girls from outer space pretending to be the french ski team come to earth to collect as much sperm as possible genre, though the synopsis may suggest otherwise. this movie is a gem, an absolute jewel that has enriched my life from the moment i laid eyes upon it. hilarious, exhilarating, action-packed, and stunningly erotic, "ach jodel mir noch einen" is a euro-madcap tour-de-force, a grossly underrated bavarian classic.<br /><br />stop everything you are doing and run out to rent, or better yet, buy this movie immediately.
