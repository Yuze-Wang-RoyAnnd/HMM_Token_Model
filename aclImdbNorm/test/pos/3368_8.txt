i wasn't sure on what to expect from the box. i am a huge fan of darko, but also saw the mess that became of southland tales, whether or not that was a studio botch up, who knows. with the box i was pleasantly surprised. it was a throwback to classic sci-fi paranoia films that hint at much larger devious happenings, but center on an intimate character base.<br /><br />the slow build, and creepy tension was very effective to the tone and theme of the entire film. any change in such pacing, would have lead to the typical hollywood or 'mtv' style, that just wouldn't have served this story's purpose correctly. everything from the strange looking/acting extras littered throughout, to the low-end score, to the minimal explanation of what exactly was going on, added an entire focused thread of underlying dread, and the shrinking sense of hope for our greedy, though well meaning, lead characters. this was something well thought out and put into motion by richard kelly, from the first act through to the end. richard matheson's short story, which this was based on, not the twilight zone ep , which was another take on the story, was one of morality and greed which were still the central elements of the box. being only some 8 pgs long, expanding it into a feature with substance would have been no easy task, but was done so with style, originality and leaves the viewer with lingering thoughts about the film. many have and will compare this to darko for whether or not it is as profound, but i found it to be an entirely different film, thematically and emotionally. it's tone is completely different, as are the messages and intents of this film. where darko left us with questions internally, the box leaves the viewer with more external questions, involving the world around us. such as, knowing human nature, would the test of the box ever come to an end? decent acting, great creepy visuals, and looming atmosphere add to the slow chilling ride. its not for everyone, but for those who get where its coming from, its a treat.
