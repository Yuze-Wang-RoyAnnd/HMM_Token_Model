for those of you unfamiliar with alisdair sims, he is of course the definitive scrooge of all them christmas carol movies. (me? i guess i'm really bad.. i haven't actually seen the darn thing). i guess those who have seen christmas carol and so used to his character might find the bells of st. trinians rather surprising. you see, in this movie, sims has two roles. one, he plays a heavy better, and in the other, he's in drag as a headmistress for a private girl's school! so once you get that through your thick skull, this movie offers plenty of delights. the plot is deals with the way the school tries to make some desperately needed money through a horse race. it's actually a little more complicated for the small kids to handle, but i think they would be preoccupied with their antics, and with the horses to really notice. the adults too might get tripped over all the thick accents being thrown around as well. but again, the story is reasonably light, the action crazy and frenetic, for one to really notice. ps, the kids all look like they come from the eloise school of cuteness.
