realistic master-piece. thirty years later, the pictures can look a bit old, but actually, it only accurate the 'fist in the face' effect of the movie. i never saw in my whole life a film like this one. first time i saw it, i didn't know if it was a fiction... and it didn't looked like... that movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see. it's the best ever society critical movie. the ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down. and the system has not change a lot, in thirty years. i think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece.
