i like the good things in life as much as anybody, i suppose, but until about five years ago, opera didn't figure into my entertainment choices. oh, i made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about; i'd watched several television productions -- notably parts of wagner's ring cycle on public television -- hoping to understand other people's fascination with the art form. and i knew i could like parts of various operas (i remember being surprised as a kid that i actually liked the snippets of "madame butterfly" in "my geisha, and i enjoyed the opera scenes in "moonstruck" and "pretty woman"), but unlike the characters in those films, i just didn't "get it."<br /><br />then in 1995 i saw a live performance of "rigoletto" presented by the new york city opera company, and that night i "got it." what a wonderful, glorious pageant of color and music and raw emotion! and i do mean emotion with a capital e! the key, i think, is that the operatic music allows the performers to over-act freely and believably in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken. everything hinges on the music, of course, and when the music is magical, as it is in "rigoletto," an opera can be a magnificent entertainment.<br /><br />a sympathetic family member gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 tv production of the opera, and i've found that since i can't see live performances of "rigoletto" live on a regular basis, this video version is a fine substitute. luciano pavarotti is perfect in the part of the duke; ingvar wixell is excellent as his mean-spirited court jester rigoletto; and rigoletto's beloved daughter gilda is played by the somewhat plain-featured edita gruberova. the sets and costumes are lavish, and the location shots on the river late in the film bring a heightened sense of drama to the story that could never be matched on a stage.<br /><br />if you've never seen "rigoletto," or if you think you don't like or understand opera, i urge you to find this one on videotape and buy it or rent it. if you don't like this, if this production of "rigoletto" doesn't make you appreciate the power of the art form of opera, well, just give it up and move on to something else. but i suspect, if you're new to opera as i was, that you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />bill anderson
