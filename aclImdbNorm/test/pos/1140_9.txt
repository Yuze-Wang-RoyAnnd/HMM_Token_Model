this is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence { just like curse of frankenstein from 1957} . if you don't like odd, non-mainstream films, steer clear of this masterpiece. for me, the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the videocassete. the storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today. for being produced in the 1980s, this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of whats to come with big government and big brother wanting to control and monitor us.<br /><br />there are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes { thats why i've watched it 6 times now} but if you can digest it all, it may prove to be well worth your time.<br /><br />the film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism . they are only concerned about accumulating and procreating. the hero of the film has not succumb to this sickness and has not been " tagged" and monitored by big brother. his mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow individulaism to once again be a part of humanity.<br /><br />yes, its very low budget, but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating. if you have an open mind, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling.
