by the acting in this movie, it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the cast are who they portray themselves to be. unbridled passion and acting at times make this a very enjoyable and engaging movie. wouldn't even have known about it except for hbo late night. and the biggest reason i like uk films much better than american ones are that the actors aren't afraid to act out what is needed.
