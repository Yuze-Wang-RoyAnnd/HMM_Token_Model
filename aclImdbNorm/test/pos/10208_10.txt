fritz lang directed two great westerns: "western union" and "the return of frank james". the frank james movie equals "jesse james". "western union" is one of randolph scott's great westerns. i have never seen robert young in a western before; he is terrific as the telegraph employee. this is the only movie i can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west. it is a high-geared story about the telegraph in the west, a triangle love story, and about loyalty. <br /><br />the supporting cast is superb. dean jagger, who made a few westerns, plays the telegraph manager. virginia gilmore, who plays mr. jagger's sister, is the love interest in the movie. ms. gilmore had a short career in movies. she quit films in 1952 and became a drama coach. she is primarily known as the first mrs. yul brynner. it is great to see slim summerville in a movie with mr. scott again. they were in two other great movies: "rebecca of sunnybrook farm" and "jesse james".
