i was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. why? firstly because mick malloy's humour can (in my humble opinion) be pretty crass and over the top, evidenced by his ill fated shemozzle of a television show some years back. and secondly because good aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the tassie tiger. <br /><br />sensibly mick has restrained his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. who would have thought that a bowls club would provide the setting for one of the funniest australian films in years. the cast is excellent with familiar local old timers all putting in believable performances. <br /><br />interesting to see john clarke playing the villain in this piece. it's a one dimensional part but jc still adds a touch of class, as always. good to see judith lucy also getting a guernsey or should i saw bowls uniform on the big screen. she's a real talent, pity a number of her retorts were expletives. her own material is a lot wittier. interesting character though. bowls reporter on a local rag. how low on the journalist food chain can one get!!<br /><br />crackerjack may not be the funniest film i've seen this year but it's certainly an enjoyable diversion, well worth a look. lots of other people obviously agree with me as it's headed to be the biggest grossing australian film this year. good to see someone finally make a quirky, gentle comedy without trying to sledgehammer the laughs like so many australian 'comedies' before it. <br /><br />finally a bit of trivia. if you're wondering which aussie rules team mick supports check out the flag on his workstation. also look out for his old partner in crime, tony martin doing the announcing in the final bowls scene. <br /><br /> <br /><br />
