will some company please make a (good+) dvd of this film!??? aside from being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships, "four friends" is the only film i've ever seen -- and i have, literally, spent *years* of my life watching films! -- that captures the essence of the 60s experience (and i was there!): the idealism, the hope, the freedom, the confusion, the betrayals, and ultimately its upbeat but bittersweet denouement. and all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous upheavals of that era, although many are just touched upon... as part of the tapestry. but the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship over about 10~15 years... and that those survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade. absolutely a joy and must-see film... even if one's not an old hippie!!!
