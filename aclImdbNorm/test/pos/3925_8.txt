my college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. i have got to say that i think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if paris hilton can act. by the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. i'm not exactly one of her fans, but i must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. overall, all the actor's were very good. i'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since i'm sure you know about it. surpirsisngly, the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them, especially elisha cuthbert and chad michael murray's characters. we meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of amityville horror or texas chainsaw massacre and feels almost documentary-like rather than a music video (don't get me wrong, i loved texas chainsaw and enjoyed amityville).<br /><br />now for the death scenes. in most slasher movies, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately cuts away to another scene,but not in this one. when a character is about to die, they die pretty gruesomely. but the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim. i won't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself.<br /><br />while this is a great slasher movies, it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films (exploring a creepy house when you shouldn't be, getting a ride with a suspicious character, splitting up, and screaming so the killer can hear you). also, there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and didn't add to the film at all. you could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out, it would not have affected the movie at all.<br /><br />basically, if you are a horror film fan, see this movie. you will not be disappointed. it's got all that's needed to make it a great slasher film, possibly the best of the year even though it's kinda early. the suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie. if you hate horror films, chances are you may like this one and if you are divided, i encourage you to give it a shot.
