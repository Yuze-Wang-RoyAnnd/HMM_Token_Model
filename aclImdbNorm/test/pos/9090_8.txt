flatliners has all the ingredients of a good joel schumacher film - intelligent, youthful characters, stunning cinematography, a gripping story, and excellent performances. it's escapist fun but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving precedings.<br /><br />schumacher has a knack for spotting talented young actors, and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things (see the cast list). their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average. kiefer sutherland shines in his egotistical med-student role.<br /><br />the cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what i love about schumacher; his use of light and location create images that stick. a disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed - reminded me of the lost boys.<br /><br />this is a film that takes an awesome premise - curious students want to find out what's after death, and successfully follows it through into a scary, gripping tale of redemption. one of schumacher's best; highly recommended.
