i feel the niiiiiight heat! i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart-beat! something ain't right!" theme song written by b.j. cook from skylark- david foster's old band and wife. she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc's "airwaves." oh night heat! what a program! well-written, well-acted and totally classic. crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. i'd like to think this is really what detectives do/did. giambone was a real favourite! on a canadian tip, i learned every canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on night heat. everyone passed through the night heat set and like law & order, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama.
