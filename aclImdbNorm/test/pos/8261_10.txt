please let me know of any versions of precious bane or gone to earth on video that people may be aware of. i love the books of mary webb wholeheartedly and would be very grateful to have any information on either vhs or dvd.<br /><br />i've read precious bane and gone to earth, which are my favorites by mary webb, many times, and have collected other novels by her also. i was lucky to have found her "springs of joy" poetry and essays, but i've never been able to see the precious bane version that was on masterpiece theatre, or the full version of gone to earth, although there was an american movie classic airing of the wild heart which was a chopped-up version of gone to earth's original film. <br /><br />if anyone can assist me in obtaining copies of either or both of these films (full versions), i would be so thankful!
