over the weekend i watched the movie tipping the velvet and if i was to have to score this movie out of 100 i would have to give it 100 no question asked. i am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in alot of different ways and the actors fit the parts without a doult. but i have to say that the ending was not so great for i did not see that spark in nancys eyes when ever she looked into flo's eyes, as her eyes sparked each time she looked at kitty, kitty only had to be in the room or in nancy's thought and nancy would just glow fron that spark. kitty told nancy that she could not find her and that she looked for her, but could not find her. kitty was ready to give it all up to get nancy back. in kitty's eyes you could see kitty's pain. i believe that nancy should have let kitty see that thier love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easy. you need to make a part two and have the two make it together, but you must not let anyone else play the roles it has to be the real kitty & nancy or it'll never work. my mother once told me that true love is just not real. i am no fool i know that we all have a true love out someplace just waiting for each of us and i believe with my life that nancy's true love really is only kitty and kitty's true love is only nancy. come on lets play the game the right way, the only way. let nancy's eyes shine again.... kitty lost her everything, by losing nancy. and kitty is not to be the only one to blame. i am gay myself and being gay is not easy!! wake up!!! in 1889 i'd not want to be gay, kitty was lost deep inside herself and in 1889 maybe the right thing to do was to be married to a man. even though you love a woman. kitty needed nancy to stand up to her needed nancy to fight for her. myself i remember how deeply i loved this girl and i let her get away because i thought i was doing something wrong and i went back to my ex-boyfriend. i thought i was doing the right thing, but i know i was wrong to let go of her and i will pay for the rest of my days,for like kitty i could not find her anyplace. i heard that she is married to a man in the u.s.a someplace. i even heard that he beats her. i guess in the end we both lose. give the two girls one more chance life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one.<br /><br />thank you, kristen ann
