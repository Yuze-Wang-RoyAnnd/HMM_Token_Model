i was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie. first, many have said that they have taken their 4 year old daughters and granddaughters to see this and they did not enjoy it. first, i don't believe that this is a kid's movie, at least not a movie for very very young children, not 4 at least. it has very subtle humor, but it is not meant to offer quick amusement as seen in tom and jerry or something like this. many people have also complained that it goes very very slowly....i guess those people are all used to "quantity" over "quality". while i have a small quality problem myself with this movie and that is that the movie was not as detail oriented as the short movies, i still believe that it managed quite well for a full feature film. and how can people complain about the jokes?? the jokes were sensible, timely and well thought out, never rude insulting or "in your face". wallace is extremely smart, yet cautious and grommit is the most adorable, smart and cute character that could be. this was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriate...for adults that is....especially with the increase of obesity and metabolic disease in the world, there's nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits for once...and this was accomplished in a very tasteful manner in that ...while people are concerned with the aspect of vegetables that doesn't necessarily mean that the are healthier or that they eat more of them...but just that they temper with nature, which is in fact what caused the legend of the were rabbit to come true. and for those out there that complained about the religious jokes, i say...came on! are you for real? many villages revolve around the local church, and legends/premonitions etc. are normal themes, no harm done. this movie was absolutely amazing, yet some people had negative comments on it and i find this absolutely absurd!!!
