in a phrase, moral ambiguity. in the soderbergh remake, there are good guys and bad guys. benicio del toro's character is clearly the good guy, morally clean and uncorruptable. his counterpart in the bbc original, fazal the farmer turned dealer, is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate. the two relentless cops are similarly different. in the american one, they win our hearts. in the bbc original, they are over-zealous, nearly obsessive.<br /><br />the best moment for me in soderbergh's was when the college student rhetorically asked the drug czar, "what would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs?" that point was insinuated throughout the bbc show, and crystallized in jack lithgow's final speech. both are excellent, but the bbc towers over the remake. my conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent pawns who are only supplying a demand, and it is the demand that causes so much suffering.
