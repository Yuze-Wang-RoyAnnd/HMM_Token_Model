"jaded" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. in lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. this director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.<br /><br />given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and d.a. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. it is not. to be a sexual predator is gender neutral. the nudity of this film is not erotic. the rape is brutal not sexual. we are looking at victims and not titillation.<br /><br />the gifted cast rings true. for a film that is so little known, i was surprised at the quality of the performances. they are good. carla gugino and rya kihlstedt are incredible.<br /><br />somehow, this film got lost. perhaps it is too smart for its own good. it is a "should see". highly recommend. a thinking person's sexual thriller.
