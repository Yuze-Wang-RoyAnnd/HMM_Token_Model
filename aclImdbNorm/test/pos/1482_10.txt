when i was younger, and today, mr. bean is a work of genius. three-time bafta nominated rowan atkinson stars as the almost silent (miming) human looking alien dropped onto earth causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. he has tried to do an exam, put his pants on in front of blind man (he didn't know he was blind), gone to church, tried to dive at a swimming pool, made lunch on a park bench, seen a scary movie, changed in his car, had a picnic with a fly intruding, spent christmas with his girlfriend (matilda ziegler), looked after a baby in portsmouth, been to room 426 of the queens hotel in portsmouth, won a pet contest with his teddy, driven on top of his mini on a new chair, and even met and knocked out the queen. guests included rudolph walker, richard briers, angus deayton, nick hancock from they think it's all over, caroline quentin, the day today's david schneider, richard wilson, the fast show's eryl maynard and the vicar of dibley's roger lloyd-pack. it was nominated the baftas for best comedy (programme or series) and best light entertainment programme. rowan atkinson was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors, he was number 24 on the comedians' comedian, and he was number 8 on britain's favourite comedian. outstanding!
