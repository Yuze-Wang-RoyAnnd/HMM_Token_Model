ken loach showed the world the down-and-out flip side of swinging london with "poor cow", about london woman joy (carol white) hooking up with a thief and having a son with him, only to see the man end up in the slammer. while his friend (terence stamp) manages to help her out some, he proves to be little better in what a loser he is. it soon becomes clear to joy that she's going to have to make a serious decision about where she's going in her life.<br /><br />one thing that i determined - i don't know whether or not this is accurate - was a use of irony in the movie. her name is joy, but she experiences no joy in her life. even if that wasn't intended, it's still a movie that i recommend to everyone. featuring songs by donovan (one of which - "colors" - appeared in another terence stamp movie: "the limey" (which, incidentally, came out in 1999, when i was as old as my parents were when "poor cow" came out)).
