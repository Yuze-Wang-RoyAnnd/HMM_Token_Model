having grown up with gwtw, i shunned both the "scarlett" sequel book and the mini-series until now. when i recently viewed the video for the first time, i was amazed how much i enjoyed watching timothy dalton's depiction of rhett butler and joanne walley-kilmer's as scarlet. i feel "scarlet" should be judged on its own merits rather than attempting any comparison with the venerable selznick masterpiece gwtw. while the "scarlet" story line and some of the dialogue suffered from lack of inspired writing, overall i thought this was a worthwhile dramatization of what might have been between scarlett and rhett.
