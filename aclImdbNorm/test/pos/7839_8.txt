first of all i'd like to start by saying it's a refreshing start to see a british drama that finally looks and feels believable. <br /><br />patrick stewart does the role justice as (ian hood), the government science adviser, with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thoughts about the future of "real world" science and how he feels it's either being used or abused by others. <br /><br />not only is the casting thoroughly maintained all the way throughout the series, but it makes it's characters seem more believable than most other british drama's. <br /><br />ashley jensen also delivers a first rate performance as dr. hood's appointed bodyguard (rachael young), she brings a refreshing take on the unscientific, uninterested everyday views of science, and her constant battling with hood makes for some very funny and memorable moments between them.<br /><br />the way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic i find positive and more engaging than the psychobabble we are so used to in other fiction or science fiction tv shows. <br /><br />there are however notable disappointments with the series, every time an episode ends i find myself disappointed that they didn't seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leaving open-ended stories unclosed. <br /><br />although bearing in mind that this is still the first series, i hope that we see a return to form in the near future where these open ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion they so rightly deserve.<br /><br />for those who enjoy more slow paced science related plot lines, this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more importantly to the point.
