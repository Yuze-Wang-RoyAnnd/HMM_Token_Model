father hood<br /><br />i can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across america, but i've seen much worse, and--when i saw this years ago--i didn't think it was particularly awful. patrick swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons, and halle berry is the cop chasing them down.<br /><br />overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life. you could certainly do worse--ever hear of the film "pod people"?<br /><br />** 1/2 out of *****<br /><br />rated pg-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content matter, violence and language.
