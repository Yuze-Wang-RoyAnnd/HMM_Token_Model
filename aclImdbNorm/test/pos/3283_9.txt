alright so this episode makes fun of al gore. i'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. the thing is south park makes fun of everybody, much like the simpsons did. if you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. with that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. al gores portrayal is hilarious, cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing. it is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites. i'll won't comment too much further on the plot because i don't want to give anything away.
