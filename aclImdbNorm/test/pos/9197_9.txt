this is probably one of those films too many commented but undiscovered... this is probably one masterpiece of spanish cinema like some bu~nuel's masters-piece. "15 days with you" could be the better "now and them" re-visitation from others films of long-time ago: could be "midnight cowboy" but could be also "les amants du pont-neuf" or a realistic and non-spot-look (but most realistic) "trainspotting". this hard story has place to humour, love and obviously dramatic sense. in the new social spanish cinema this little diamond could be the resurrection of the italian neo realism mixed whit the best ken loach films.<br /><br />probably the better film i discover in the last 10 years.
