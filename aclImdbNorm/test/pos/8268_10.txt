having known and loved this book since i was eleven i was terrified to see it coming up as a movie - what if they'd made a dreadful mess of it? in the event i needn't have worried at all. everyone was very well cast and the acting is terrific, it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison, which to me added nothing at all. however it really is the most beautiful love story and i'm so glad i videoed it so i can watch it again and again. my only gripe is - why didn't they give kester a green waistcoat 'which made him such a personable man'? such a simple thing, when they went to so much trouble for everything else. if you get the chance, see this, it is excellent.
