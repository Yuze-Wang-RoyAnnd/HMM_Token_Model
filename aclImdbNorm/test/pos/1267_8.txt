this is an excellent film, but momento (nolan's other big budget film) is much better . i would recommend people go to see momento and then if they like that, see this film. the film is shot in black and white which i was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. it is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing. to conculde the film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film i have to say that it is pretty amazing.
