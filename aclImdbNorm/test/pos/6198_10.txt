i'm not sure how this could have been better, so i gave it a 10. the acting was excellent - the main woman was so hot - the chap who played darwyn was a smouldering, pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering (the truck driver's death is one example)excellently. the storyline was believable and the series length was just about right (i.e. i love lost, but will it ever end?). as a brit i tend to think of yanks as gung ho. the lapd were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were portrayed positively. my main thought about programmes like this (and the also excellent 24) is - could it happen? would it happen? is it happening now? possibly, probably.<br /><br />i hope they do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it would appear not.<br /><br />to summarise - if you haven't seen it, make sure you do.
