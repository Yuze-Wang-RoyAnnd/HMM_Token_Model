i was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie. i was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money. i believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is. little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling. the shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films, anything could happen in the film. the acting is by no means perfect, nor were they bad. the main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her. in the end, i was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects.<br /><br />it is definitely a film i would recommend.
