i hope the writer, director, editor, and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. let me start by saying that i am in no way affiliated with this movie. i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times.<br /><br />every second of this movie is touching. every scene is classic. the acting is real. the movie is honest. you can relate to these characters as people, not actors.<br /><br />this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives. the story is carefully thought out and every sub-plot is intertwined and woven together, culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside.<br /><br />crispen glover, daniel roebuck, dennis hopper, and joshua john miller (as a 12 year old boy) give absolutely amazing, real performances. i've seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie. it's that good. great job everyone who worked on this. great job.<br /><br />the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting. with the chosen cast, the carefully timed editing and pacing, the mood and tone, and even the subject matter, the director made some of the best decisions for a movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />this movie is real. it's honest. it's a true movie experience which i will never forget. you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore. ultimately, it's about people being people... and everyone can relate to that. i recommend this movie to fans of drama, suspense, and horror above almost every other film.
