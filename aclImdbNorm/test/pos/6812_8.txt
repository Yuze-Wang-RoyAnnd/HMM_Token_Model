this was so much better than i expected, the film oozed proffesionalism compared to other b-moive of this sort of budget. the script was good if a little formulaic but the acting was surprisingly good from all including lorenzo and you always expect good standards from scheider and busey. aswell as the good plot and acting the action is good especially the car chases and the crashes are a-class. all in all this is a rise above other b-movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy puns to make up for budget and script defficiencies, its certainly worth a rent.
