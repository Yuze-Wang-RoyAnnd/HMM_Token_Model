what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them, bugs them,haunts them. billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition. he paints the good and the bad in all of us. he also paints with love. i can't imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it. they will last because they are true. i first saw this movie on tv in the 60s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed. now i'm an old man and i still feel the tears welling but don't leave the room. i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. billy preserved them in this film and not in a 'greatest generation' way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.
