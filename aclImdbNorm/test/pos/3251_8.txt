i'm afraid i must disagree with mr. radcliffe, as although he is correct in saying this isn't a comedy, it has many other merits. the plot is a little mad at parts, but i believe it it all fits together nicely, creating a satisfying, enjoyable film. the last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film, but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting, showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect expect something as deep as goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable.
