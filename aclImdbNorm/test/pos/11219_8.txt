northfork is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. for this alone the film is well worth one's time. the stark, wide open plains and badlands of eastern montana are captured in the spare, muted earth tones of autumn or early spring. the gigantic grey cement fort peck dam is the film's protagonist. the film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of western landscape. the dialogue can be trying at times, yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film. the 1950's period works so well here and is executed so well. i think that the passing years will be kind to this film.
