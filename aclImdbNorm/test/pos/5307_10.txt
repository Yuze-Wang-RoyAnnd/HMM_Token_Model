this is a superb film and was immediately put in my top ten (trust me i know films!). it's one of the movies that really makes you think, not necessarily about the storyline but about yourself! the film is about a fifteen year old kid (leland fitzgerald)who kills an autistic boy. he is sent to juvenile hall where he meets pearl madison, his teacher. his relationship with pearl slowly grows and eventually pearl decides to write a story on leland and his peers but as he gets closer to finding out lelands motive he learns he must deal with his own issues first.<br /><br />this is a great film and a must see with great music by the pixies and a fantastic score! watch it!
