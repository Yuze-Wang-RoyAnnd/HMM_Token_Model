when it was announced the "king of pop" was dead at age 50, a month before he was to start a series of live comeback shows at london's o2 arena, it was a huge shock to millions of people around the world. he was, and will forever be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will be missed terribly. i decided to remind myself how wonderful he was by watching what is considered by many to be not only jackson's best video (and possibly song), but the greatest music video ever made, from director john landis (an american werewolf in london). the film opens with michael and his girl (ola ray) having their car breakdown, and after giving her a ring, the moon comes out and he turns into a werewolf. we then see michael and his girl watching this horror film in the cinema, she is scared and walks out, and michael soon follows her, singing the iconic song. soon enough the voice of vincent price comes on, and zombies start crawling out the earth and open coffins from the graveyard, and michael and the girl are obviously surrounded. she turns away, and michael has become a zombie himself, and with all the other creatures they do the iconic dance, before he turns back into his normal self, at least for the chorus. the girl runs into the near creepy house, blocks the doorway, but zombie michael still manages to break through, and when he touches her she screams to see normal michael say "what's the problem?" the film ends with him taking her home, and looking at us with evil eyes. michael jackson was number 14 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons, and he was number 6 on the ultimate pop star, the thriller album was number 4 on the 100 greatest albums, and this video was number 71 on the 100 greatest scary moments, and it was number 1 on the 100 greatest pop videos. very good!
