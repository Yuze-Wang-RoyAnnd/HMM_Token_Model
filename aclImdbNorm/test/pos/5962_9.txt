one of starevich's earliest films made in france is possibly his only political satire. the story of the frogs who wanted a king mirrors its title as a group of high "croakers" feel that democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from jupiter to rule their land. when he sends down a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying the stump is but "political timber." jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time whose frog lusty eyes devour the town's residents. as the original "croaker" is about to slide down the stork's beak, he speaks his moral: "let well enough alone." this film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs. starewicz tricks the audience into believing they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at one time. the slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in a few places diminish the quality of repeat viewings, however its historical significance in starewicz's life make it of importance to watch. his feelings towards government immediately following his flee from russia are likely expressed in this film. in addition, the technical accomplishments of animating so many characters at once in a stop-motion film is astounding.
