after watching "a texas tale of treason" you feel a renewed disgust for the nature of the hollywood beast. inside the interviews and conversations of all involved with the project there is a common sense of comradery and rebelliousness that spans backgrounds, social classifications, and even geography. this can be attributed to hard work on the entire production's undying commitment to the project and the love the of the story from the original film, and the complete creation of vacuum that is it's creator. the scale of people involved in "waldo's hawaiian holiday" was amazing to me, at a no budget, no glory production. there were no trailers or craft services, no amenities at all, and yet everyone involved stuck right there with it. if nothing ever comes of this project, antstuie productions have laid their foundation for being a serious, honest company that's never going to lay down and take it or sell out and make a movie just for the money. i'd like to see any l.a. director go through the guerrilla process to get a shot. more realistic true to life cinema is lacking in this time of cg and green screens. the masses may enjoy their entertainment spoon fed to them in nice bite sized censored calm bits, but there is a large group of people out here in the world that share the opinions and insights of the filmmakers that still make films for the love of the material or love of storytelling, not dvd sales or box office. i loved this documentary, and i hope that ifc has the cahones to pick it up and air it so that maybe, just maybe, one more person will decide to pick up a camera and film some real life so we the viewer can have even a temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same, and anyone anywhere can be a true storyteller.
