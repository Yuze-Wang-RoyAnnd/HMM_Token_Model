i really like the show!! as a part of greek life, i can say that some things are over-exaggerated, but overall it's still pretty damn funny.<br /><br />rusty is a likable lead character, his roommate is hilarious and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights. i like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations.<br /><br />this show covers it all, and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad (how else could it be on abc family?).<br /><br />my favorites are cappie (of course), rusty's roommate and pretty much all of kappa tau. this show is a great launch pad for them and i'm excited to see what doors this opens. <br /><br />please renew this show next summer, abc family. like i said, love love love it!!
