i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. it has it's moments i guess you would say. some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool, and some of the location shots were very authentic. i won't be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting. i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre. the action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is pretty interesting. 7 out of ten
