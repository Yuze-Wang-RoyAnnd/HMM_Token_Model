okay, i'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler so i just ticked the box anyway to save the hassle.<br /><br />i've noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair split. personally, i loved it, although i must say that i think that some of the cameo's were there for the sake of having a cameo. (peter kay?) personally, i am just thankful that it wasn't the edward, tubbs and papa lazarou show, and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to headline the motion picture, especially sir goeff tipps arguably the funniest of the bunch.<br /><br />actually, this is less of a summary more of a fairly obtuse blog-like thing, but what the hell, the film was awesome, and i guess that's all that counts.
