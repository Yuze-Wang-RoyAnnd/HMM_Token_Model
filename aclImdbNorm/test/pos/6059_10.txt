i had the good fortune to be at perris island in the fall of 1959. the di showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks, plt 162, b co, 1st bn, 1st itr.<br /><br />although we hadn't been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie, we could hear those that were laughing. it's one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at pi.<br /><br />at some later date, i got to actually see it in a theater. i'm still convinced that, to date, it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950's ever done. no one has done it better than jack webb...
