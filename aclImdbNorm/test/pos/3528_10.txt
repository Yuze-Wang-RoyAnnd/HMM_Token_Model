this was a great 1981 film which had a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip together and go through thick woods and high mountains with a great water fall. this group of people run into property owned by george kennedy, (roy mclean) who plays the role as a forest ranger and rides a white horse. roy mclean warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back. of course these young people pay no attention and proceed to have a ball swimming in the nude near the water fall and playing great music and dancing by the fire and having plenty of beer and wine. there is an old wooden one room school house that draws the gals and guys inside and it is from that point on the film starts to get very scary. there is one occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree in order to get away from a human beast who desires her body and starts chopping the tree down in order to capture her. don't miss this film, there is plenty of everything.
