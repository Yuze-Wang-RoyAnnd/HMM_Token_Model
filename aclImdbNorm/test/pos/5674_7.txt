"black water" is a movie that in a way surprised me, and definitely exceeded my original expectations. "black water" is truly a very well structured, unpredictable, thrilling, well directed, and well creepy movie. the plot is actually somewhat original, and will definitely keep you intrigued with it. one thing i love about this movie is the direction, because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations. my original expectations of "black water" was that it was a crappily made, acted, directed, paced, and boring movie. it really wasn't. well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were i feel they didn't show enough emotions, and there are some lines that feel just so scripted. however i love the direction because all of it's shots seem predictable, but arn't. like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water, and it goes quite, you're like the croc's about to attack. however the croc's attacks are very unpredictable(which was bad for me who doesn't handle films like this all to greatly), and this does make you jump. plus i just love that it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump, but instead the actual movie. i also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees, it made it seem very real, and definitely kept your eyes on the screen. i must say i didn't think the opening 20 so minutes were done well, and i think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life. plus i didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn't. also again i just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic. for example i wouldn't have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it, let alone a killer one. however these problems really arn't that major, and i was still able to enjoy the film. overall as far as movies go, i've seen better, but as far as animal attack horror films(a genre i get easily scarred at) it's one of the better ones you'll see. and sure it's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot.
