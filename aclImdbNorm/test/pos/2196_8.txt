last year, i fell in love with the tim burton's version of sweeney todd so i wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and i found this one at the library. though i think burton's is best, probably because i like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. i haven't seen any of the other versions but i am trying to get my hands on them.<br /><br />after seeing johnny depp as todd, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but george hearn does a fantastic job. angela lansbury is great, as always and all of the singing is fantastic. i found myself singing along. this is a play you won't want to miss, but try and see it before you see the film version so you won't have a biased view like me.
