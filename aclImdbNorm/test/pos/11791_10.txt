i really liked this movie. if other people want to give it an average around 5.0/10 that's their choice. i would give it 10/10. sutherland's performance as a private eye is totally awesome. the story is amazing, human, exciting, intelligent. the dialogue is good. the story might not be perfect but anyway - the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that. moreover, the ending is incredibly cool and their the jig-saw puzzle really comes back to together. so anyway i liked it. i also thought the female lead actress performed very well. i'm not a big fan of detective movies but this one was really good, also because it doesn't give a damn about conventions of the supernatural.
