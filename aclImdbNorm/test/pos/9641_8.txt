robert montgomery and robert young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in italy during world war i. the dialog is highly entertaining, and jimmy durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "ptomaine". walter huston's character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine, a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman. one of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes. i was surprised at how similar the technology of world war i was to the technology displayed 25 years later in world war ii. basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times, and far from the conservativism i thought existed in the so-called "innocent" past. all in all i felt that the cast, characters, action scenes, and view of history depicted in this movie were first-rate.
