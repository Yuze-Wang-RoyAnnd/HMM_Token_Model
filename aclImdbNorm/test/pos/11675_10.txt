<br /><br />first of all, i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed, the la punks.<br /><br />i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in finland.<br /><br />so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it? i like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, thus i know punks from all over europe & americas, so why do you, who find this music "repugnant" care to comment at all?<br /><br />
