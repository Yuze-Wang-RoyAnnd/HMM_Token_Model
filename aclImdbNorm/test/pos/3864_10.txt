set in paris in the year 1910, a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat duchess ( voiced by eva gabor) and her kittens, but the jealous butler edgar comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside. luckily for them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat named thomas o'malley ( voiced by phil harris) helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the swinging' scat cat ( voiced by scatman crothers) and try to foil edgar's plans.<br /><br />very entertaining and edgy post-walt disney's death animated movie with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable "everybody wants to be a cat", good voice acting and some terrific animation for it's time even in these times of computer animation. not one of the greatest disney animated movies but a cult disney animated fave and one of the few gems of it's day that works well, highly recommended.
