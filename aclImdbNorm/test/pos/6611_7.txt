this film to me deserves a lot of praise, because even though i am not a surfer or skater, i remained inspired throughout the whole documentary.<br /><br />the depth of history and development of these two extreme sports emphasised what they were able to do for two groups of individuals. the dedication that these individuals had/have is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded.<br /><br />unlike most other documentaries, this one was cleverly put together, the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing i have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused. without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today.<br /><br />the film explores areas such as the success, such accomplishing new tricks, winning competitions and gathering fame. as well as failures such as injury or burning out.<br /><br />it was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the skaters and surfers themselves and not from second hand information. this resulted in a better picture to be drawn.<br /><br />overall, a truly outstanding effort.
