this movie was made only 48 years after the end of the civil war--most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic. it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary, birth of a nation--a patently absurd and racist film. because of this, this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer. the boy makes good and is a hero, though the film ends rather melodramatically--a definite convention of the day. not a great film, but a decent plot, decent acting and little of the over-the-top acting you often saw in other films of the day.<br /><br />one annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious. it got annoying from time to time.
