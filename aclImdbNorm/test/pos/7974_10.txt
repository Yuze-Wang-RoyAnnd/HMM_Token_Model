hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste, even though it is no worse than many films. nevertheless, i did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery & all; but, the story-line was very weak and i couldn't really see the point of it all. however, the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the lackluster film.<br /><br />where did the guys -nate & noah cryns- who wrote this music come from? they are awesome!! from the moment the music begins, it is by far, better than anything i've heard in years. i think it may be the best i've ever heard! even though i wasn't thrilled with the action taking place on the film, the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene. i was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like i was re-living those old days through the music.<br /><br />this movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again.
