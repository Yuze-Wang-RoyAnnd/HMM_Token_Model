excellent story-telling and cinematography. poignant, biting social commentary.<br /><br />superb effects. well-filmed and acted.<br /><br />however, the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (though very well done) at times drags on a little too much (about 3 hrs), and over-interrupts the flow of the story.<br /><br />i first read the book as a child, and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people -- but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of the "yahoos"! well, although the adventure plot may sound like a children's story, it's in fact a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decay in england at the time of jonathan swift, the author of the novel that the film is based upon.
