good drama/comedy, with two good performances from hunter & hurt, but albert brooks steals every scene he is in. with a great script, this movie soars and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent. and although joan cusack is not in this much, but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie. the highlight of the movie for me, was albert brooks speech on the devil. only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places. and i only got totally interested in brooks role, not so much in hunter's or hurt's. i give this a 7 out of 10.
