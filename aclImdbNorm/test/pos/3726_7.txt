well, i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. this movie wasn't it. it plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that i was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between jean reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom i didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time. he wanders around alone for the most part, he doesn't meet anyone; i imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something, which is all good, but i still wish he'd trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15, because it can get incredibly boring.<br /><br />but after those 40 minutes, things start to get very interesting. i guess i won't really say more than that because i don't want to spoil anything. so if you've seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off (like i was), just stick with it--it gets a lot better.<br /><br />one of the most interesting things i found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever, which really made me have to think about what was happening, how characters were feeling and what their motivations were, why things were how they were in this post-apocalyptic world, all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation. and it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors aren't telling you exactly what's going on.
