when i see a movie, i usually seek entertainment. but of course if i know what genre the move is, then i will seek what it is meant to do. for example, if it is a deep film, i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying. but who's that girl? is not a deep film. but it is entertaining, nonetheless. it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch. there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts. i've watched it when i was younger. the cast is always entertaining as usual. i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasn't the typical male heartthrob at the time. haviland morris also stars. and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too! overall, a delight!
