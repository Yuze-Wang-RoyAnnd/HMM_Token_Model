this two disc set is incredible! if you're like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live, then this is the next best thing. jimmy page, who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk the face of the earth (second only to slowfingers himself), he puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film. john paul jones, although not as up front as page, puts on one hell of a show. although in the live atmosphere, his rythmic bass lines aren't as defined as they are on studio recordings, except of course in songs like dazed and confused, or what is and what should never be), but his wide array of instumental talent is well displayed in these dvd's. john bonham is john bonham, what can i say? there is no comparison, his beats stand out like no other, and this dvd is proof. last, but not least, robert plant wails like no other can wail. if you've ever read hammer of the gods, you'll be wondering the same thing as page was when he first met robert plant, why the hell isn't this guy already famous? and so concludes my review, sorry about and spelling or grammar mistakes, zeppelin rocks.
