early coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see (a pity). there's some wonderful things going on in this one - shirley knight's best performance (an underrated actress), a road trip in the late 1960's, james caan very restrained and moving, robert duvall in a part he was born to play (edgy, lonely, motorcycle cop), and a touching script with f. coppola behind the wheel.<br /><br />if this had been made five years later by some nobody, it would have been a smash (so much for timing). anyway, i recommend this to all people who don't need outer-space explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold. give this one a chance if you can find it!
