how good is this film? apparently, good enough that they plan to remake it in 2011. jean-pierre melville, who gave us le doulos and the good thief, wrote and directed this film.<br /><br />the film is almost a silent. these are men of few words, preferring to let their actions speak for them. they live by a code that governs their every move.<br /><br />there are some great actors in this film - alain delon (the leopard), yves montand (jean de florette, let's make love), and gian maria volonte (el indio from a fistful of dollars & a few dollars more). the film does not shine on them; they are along for the ride that melville has for them. melville makes the film; they make it better.<br /><br />you see melville's work in the ocean films, but they just get the idea. the can't make it work like he did. a great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.
