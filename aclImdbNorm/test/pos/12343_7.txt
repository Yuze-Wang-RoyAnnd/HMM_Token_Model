julie (meg tilly) is a "goody two shoes" type high school girl who, determined to prove something to herself, allows herself to be subjected to the rituals of "the sisters", a small-scale clique presided over by snooty, homecoming queen type carol (robin evans). the sisters propose that for julie's final test she will spend the night in a mausoleum, preparing to drive julie up the wall, but not knowing that recently deceased, ill-intentioned psychic raymar is interred there and has plans to cause havoc from beyond the grave.<br /><br />while this debut picture for tom mcloughlin ("friday the 13th part vi: jason lives" and "sometimes they come back") is limited by its obviously low budget, it's what mcloughlin and his crew are able to do with it that counts. it's genuinely creepy, unsettling fare; it might have very well scared the stuffing out of me if i were under 10 years of age, and even at my current age, it still got to me to a degree.<br /><br />some of the effects look cheesy, but the decent looking corpses and gore are created by tom burman, an experienced makeup effects artist, who, while tending to be overshadowed by more famous names like winston, baker, and bottin, has a good resume with other films like "cat people" (1982) and "the beast within" to his credit.<br /><br />what i liked most about it was a real sense of foreboding and atmosphere, an aspect missing from some of the current trendy horror movies being shown in our multiplexes.<br /><br />tilly is cute and appealing in her role, having recently completed her debut film work in "tex" before joining this production. "one dark night" was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983, where it actually did decent business during its first few weeks. the other actors do what they have to do well enough; familiar faces in the supporting cast include the equally appealing veteran singer / actress / voice-over artist elizabeth (a.k.a. e.g.) daily, kevin peter hall, for once *not* playing some sort of creature character, but who unfortunately ends up with very little screen time, and none other than adam "batman" west. the director's wife nancy, who would play lizbeth in "jason lives", appears here as the spacey girl in front of the arcade.<br /><br />it's decent b-level horror entertainment, maybe too cheap for its ambitions, and maybe not that slick (hey, mcloughlin *was* just starting out), but definitely good for some chills.<br /><br />7/10
