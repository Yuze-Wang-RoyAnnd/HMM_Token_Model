the producers of this picture are hungarians. it's not by crazy artistic momentum that x and z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in hungarian. - by the way, david, isten is the word for god in hungarian... - hum... is that so ? <br /><br />let's consider this movie as 'a history of violence' science-fictional sibling. both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none fx-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now. everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details : the nod to phil k. dick (who wrote "in the days of perky pat") by creating a 'perky pat' fast-food restaurant. the nod to stanley kubrick by using 2001's naming pattern ; as ibm became hal (one letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 movie, in existenz 'classic lubricant spray' wd-40 becomes xe-60 (one letter up) when allegra cleans up pikul's port. the nod to david cronenberg by using videodrome's witty kind of formula ('death to...' & 'long live'..) and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture (tv in videodrome, video games and virtual reality in existenz in 1983, you penetrated a tv set. in 1999, you're penetrated by a game. welcome to canada!)<br /><br />the nod to good taste by getting peter suschitzky's cinematography, howard shore's music and ronald sanders's editing (a team that wins). for everyone born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in the hands, this movie rings a bell. enough with the nods. the plot ? "jennifer jason leigh stars as a game designer (allegra) who creates a virtual-reality game that taps into the players' minds" as we can see on the movie main details page. that's the story in the story. to me, this picture is about a 'reality demonstrators' young couple infiltrating the 'brand new virtual game' presentation session to destroy its programmer. i assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there's such thing as reality. jennifer jason leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they're in and the end of the movie is the reality, with video games freaks giggles, big hairy dogs, 'cronenbergy realistic' plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. what you see is true. they play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there's a game (existenz) in which jjl plays existenz's genius programmer and jude -pikul - law a marketing trainee associated with allegra's game), they play existenz because allegra is very concerned about her pod's health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and pikul in then wins the game (transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill yevgeny nourish, transcendenz programmer.<br /><br />playing existenz and transcendenz is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' turns into allegra, a 'virtuality goddess').<br /><br />what game would heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ? to be truly engaged in the world ?<br /><br />and what about nietschze (yes friedrich, god is dead and you know what ? willem dafoe stands for him! - god, the mecanic -) ??? <br /><br />yes we do construct a narrative for ourselves, and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities ; existenz's discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly. and we could sometimes get some neat stuff ; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.
