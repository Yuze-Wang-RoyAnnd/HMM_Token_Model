completely worth checking out. saw it on mlk's birthday 2006 and it hit me big time. sometimes it feels like we're all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change. all we can do is to keep on going and speaking out. just keep on going. don't mean to be a downer because that's not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves. what happens when we keep being told by the best people like mlk what needs to happen to pull us out of our "dead end road" but we don't listen. i know that some of us do listen but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are? just keep going, i guess. this movie got me thinking even more about all of this so i guess it has done what it set out to do. that's what i consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything: something that gets you thinking and keyed up to move in an active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless.
