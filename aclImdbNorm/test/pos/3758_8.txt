what a surprise. a basic copycat of the comedy classic 'the nutty professor' only naughtier. funny guy tim thomerson (who steals the show as blinkin in robin hood-men in tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive dr. jekyll and the sex crazed hyde. <br /><br />the one scene that is really funny is when dr. lanyon (mark blankfield) catches jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: <br /><br />"how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."<br /><br /> jekyll replies, "but sir, i'm going ahead with the operation."<br /><br />lanyon replies back, "oh. well in that case fu** your brains out!!!"
