i see alot of movies at the cinema (103 so far this year) and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year, even though it was released back in 1954!<br /><br />i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print. <br /><br />the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music, merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist. pure quality. <br /><br />although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour.<br /><br />not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort!! <br /><br />if you ever get a chance to see this movie, please do not hesitate, it's a classic. <br /><br />
