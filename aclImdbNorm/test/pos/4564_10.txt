face it, folks-- "dk3" is more challenging, innovative, and clever than its predecessor. challenging-- its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time. one especially difficult level is called "lightning lookout," in which you may be struck by lightning at any given time. innovative-- it opened a lot of doors. too bad the snes died out not long after this title. and clever-- the level names range from trademark plays-on-words ("lake orangatanga") to witty references that the game's targeted audience won't get for many years to come ("bleak's house").<br /><br />what irks me about most people's criticism of this game mainly comes down to two words: kiddy kong. he is a worthy "little-buddy" successor to diddy kong, and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as "that retarded monkey." "dk3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
