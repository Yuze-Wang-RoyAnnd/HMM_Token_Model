i enjoyed this one, because i can relate to it. <br /><br />at one time in my life i was trying to make films, and experienced many of the same problems mark borchardt did in trying to make his film. and i also went through a protracted period of self-absorbed arrested development, where i refused to grow. but then, miraculously, i got married, and had kids. i realized that being a struggling filmmaker was, in all likelihood, not going to feed my family. so i got a decent job and did what i felt i needed to do to make that happen. that is what an mature, responsible adult does. <br /><br />mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet, and so, in that sense, he is a retarded adolescent. for this reason, there is a hopelessness about him. like don quixote, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is. the viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. mark has kids and an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his "artistic vision". <br /><br />despite this, mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual, surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends. unfortunately, mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial clout, etc.. yet he trudges on, much like ed wood, apparently without any semblance of a clue. <br /><br />i guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the "never say die" attitude of this noble individual, struggling against the odds. and man, what odds there are! kiefer sutherland, colin hanks, tori spelling and angelina jolie are all offspring of big-time film or tv people; no doubt, they will all want to direct some day, if they aren't already. how much room is there for an independent like mark? it's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board, over and over again. come to think of it, that is pretty close to what happens to one of mark's actors, with the kitchen cabinet door, in one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any movie.<br /><br />despite these misgivings and seeming criticisms, i truly enjoyed this movie, and would heartily recommend it to anyone. uncle bill is amazing. i have a friend who met both mike and mark and he told me that, in real life, these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie.
