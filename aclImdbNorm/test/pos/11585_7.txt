-facts (i): "mar adentro" relates the well-known (at least in spain) story of ram'on sampedro, a galician quadriplegic who killed himself (helped by some friends) after 28 years prostrated by his condition. judges had denied several times his petitions of active euthanasia.<br /><br />-facts (ii): "mar adentro" becomes the movie of the year in spain. everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people... everyone likes it, even the critics' opinions are unanimous. the film wins a lot of prizes (golden globe, oscar, goya...) and annoys catholic community and life-lovers quadriplegics. a star is born.<br /><br />-facts (iii): the intensity and the quality of the actors in "mar adentro" are just amazing, and this makes mi wonder how come we have to watch the same bad young actors in the most of spanish latest movies. i don't know if javier bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there's quite a difference between one thing or the other); anyway, his job is just impressive, as well as lola due~nas', bel'en rueda's, or the job of all the guest starrings. this is (the actors selection) the strong point in amen'abar's movie.<br /><br />-facts (iv): alejandro amen'abar learned his lesson there at the cinema school, there's no doubt about it: he's got a privileged brain. he takes good control of each and every one of the technical aspects, he knows what the audiences want, he knows how to touch the right chord, even if that turns him into such a demagogue (just like spielberg is -one of amen'abar's idols-).<br /><br />-facts (and v): if you criticize a movie such as "mar adentro" it will seem like you have any kind of trouble with the moral issue the story tells about. there's a trap in this kind of pictures: you have to differentiate between the movie itself and the moral concepts. if you don't like "schindler's list" that does not mean that you agree with hitler's philosophy (or do you?). so, for me, it is a good film and an extraordinary story (since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). grandiloquent, self-kind, and everything but neutral (no matter what amen'abar or bardem have said about it: those characters that are not in favor of euthanasia come to no good at all!!). 50 % hard / 50% way too sentimental.<br /><br />-epilogue: "mar adentro" wouldn't be by no mean in my ranking of the best 50's spanish movies of all time. nobody has special merits in the story but ramon sampedro himself. he is the movie. now, alejandro amen'abar is gonna become the more international spanish director ever, maybe he'll go to live to hollywood; but some of us would like to watch him filming a simple story, without bit final twists, without living dead nor dying alive... "the others" is still his best movie.<br /><br />*my rate: 7/10
