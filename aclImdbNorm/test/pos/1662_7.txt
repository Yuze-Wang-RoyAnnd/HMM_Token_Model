you can take the crook out of the joint, but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook. we've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like bob le flambeur, elevator to the gallows, touchez pas au grisbi, the anderson tapes, etc. too many times to mention. what helps make this one one of the more notable is (of course) the heist itself, which plays out wordlessly in real time, and the demeanor of the lead. bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story (it almost demands it). all around, one of the better films noir.
