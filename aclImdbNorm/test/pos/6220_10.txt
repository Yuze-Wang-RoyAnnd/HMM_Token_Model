j"aniksen vuosi is one of jarva's most political movies. it takes stance strongly against modern day society's authority status in the life of the common man, and how it has estranged men from the nature completely. it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society.<br /><br />vatanen (antti litja) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland - only to realize that the concept of a 'free country' isn't all that unambiguous, in other words, the society has the common man by the balls.<br /><br />still the thing that makes j"aniksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humouristic brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the 70's, as well as the whole identity of finland as a nation. vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness. since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns, the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes j"aniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving.
