a young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as lady macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car. a success winning her accolades, betty(christina marsillach)finds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways.<br /><br />first her stage manager boyfriend, stefano(william mcnamara)is viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch, rope-tied to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion, keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch-taped under her eyes, with pricking a result if she blinks. allowing her to escape, betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position, when a specific gold chain is found on her lady macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room, by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors(..to cap off this nasty scene, the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it; while not specifically elaborating this act, dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face). having nowhere to turn, inspector alan santini(urbano barberini, playing him cold and bland at dario's request)promises to catch the psycho as betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort, the theater director marco(ian charleson, of ghandi & chariots of fire who would later die of aids;a sad footnote, dario revealed in an interview that charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was hiv positive)attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics, and pal mira(daria nicolodi, dario's former squeeze), her agent and confident. but, the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will, of course, occur in the theater as marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal.<br /><br />i think this is dario at his most savage & nihilistic. although he has certainly made later gruesome films(..such as his masters of horror entries and sleepless would suggest), this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. his method of forcing betty to watch was admittedly a gag by dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies. i found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink(..brilliantly, dario shoots the pricking from point-of-view achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open). i like how dario will show the widened eyes of betty, horrified at what she's being forced into watching, as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink. the photographic work of ronnie taylor is impeccable, such as the crow's point-of-view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer. or, when the camera "travels" through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat. or, the dream sequence where we are taken into betty's memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer, donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present. the highlight, in my opinion, is the peephole bullet-fire sequence, masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of her head, going through a telephone betty planned to use to call for help. we even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer(..to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it's beak). only aspect i didn't care for, often pointed out by naysayers of the film, is the "final" ending which i personally felt was a bit unnecessary, but i guess dario wanted to point out that betty was indeed not like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which, in a twist, relate to why the killer torments our heroine. the rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me, because i felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide.
