i remember reading the original balzac story in college french.<br /><br />i remember ken nordine of wgn-tv in chicago reading it as one of his late night shows.<br /><br />always loved the story but never believe they could or would make a movie of it. to my surprise they did and did it very well.<br /><br />few of any balzac stories lend themselves to dramatization, which is unfortunate, and -cat lover that i am, i was always hoping it would be filmed without a lot of hollywood sexing up. this is as close to perfect conversion as could be done.<br /><br />the theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but this is as close as i think it can come to letting the imagination of reading meet the reality of seeing.
