being from the buffalo area i was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications. i was most impressed with the movie, especially its clever plot, the acting and the local scenes. nice to see so many older, quality stars in the various roles. i feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent.
