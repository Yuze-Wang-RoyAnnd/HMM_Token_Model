the three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless chaplin classics, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either. chaplin's score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done. the problem with this compilation is a minor one, yet annoying. the shorts have been stretch-printed to fit the 24 frame p.s. speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p.s. this results is jerky motion that doesn't look very attractive, and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it's just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored, the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed. there are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on dvd, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but alas this has not been done.<br /><br />a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article, but i say again a minor quibble, it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating. the shorts are still worth '10'.
