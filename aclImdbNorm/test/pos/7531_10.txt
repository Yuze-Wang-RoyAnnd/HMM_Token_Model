watching this movie, i can't help drawing the comparison between it and wild reeds, another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age.<br /><br />like wild reeds, this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried. so if you want a quick resolution to things, don't watch it. this movie is like a slice of life, beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly. there's no resolution to anything, no happily ever after for anybody, just like real life.<br /><br />this movie is as real as it gets. the acting is surprisingly good. the director is fond of long, really long, shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts.<br /><br />i love this movie. i almost didn't watch it but now i'm very glad that i did. it's not a movie for everyone but if you're willing to let it grow on you, you will be rewarded.<br /><br />10/10
