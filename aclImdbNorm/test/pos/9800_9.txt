i first saw this movie as a younger child. my sister had told me about it and i thought it would be more of a kid's movie. however it remains to also be an incredible movie. true that the subject behind the movie is ruff but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart.<br /><br />i was only 6 when i first saw it and just yesterday, 7 years later, i saw it again. for the first time in a long time. even after i knew how it ended, i knew that i had seen it a billion, bizillion times i wept like a teeny weeny little baby. when i saw it a few years back i finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film. so i stoped watching it for a while. but yesterday i didn't change the channel, i watched it. by the end i was astonished at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think, and above all, believe in mericals again. i haven't belived in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart. this movie wasn't just impacting. i was also so impressed with the actors. especially bobby. so if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time i suggest seeing it alone. with tissues. and being ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. this movie touched my soul when i was only 6, and even in this time of trying to figure out who i am this movie helped me realize both what i don't and still do want to be in life.
