i must be getting old because i was riveted to this movie from the first time i saw it. i'm watching it again right now on hbo. it's a very simple film about 2 people that fall in love after they found out that there spouses were having an affair. plot is very thin, but the actors acted very well in this movie. in the mix of kristen scott thomas running for congress and harrison ford being an internal affairs cop, these two meet, under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. i love the soundtrack. perfect fit. one thing i can't figure out, this movie had a budget of $68 million dollars. were was it spent? the plane crash or harrison ford's salary?
