not since "harold and maude" has suicide been so successfully used as the theme for a love story. the acting, by a top notch cast is terrific. with a well structured script, things progress at an enjoyable pace. there are moments of black comedy, but i would classify "my suicidal sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy, with a touch of dark humor. the relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers, is both touching and engaging. the movie actually makes you question, what is a normal relationship? i highly recommend "my suicidal sweetheart". seek it out on dvd under the title "crazy for love". you will not be disappointed. - merk
