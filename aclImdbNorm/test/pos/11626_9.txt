sigrid thornton (seachange) was seemingly born to fill the role of cato's philadelphia gordon, in this story that is often compared with margaret mitchell's american civil war classic gone with the wind. waters (heaven tonight) is in arguably his best role also as her larrakin love interest, and the two leads head a wonderful australian cast in this, arguably the most well-known and best-loved of australian miniseries. it's<br /><br /> an outstanding production all round, though don't try watching all of it in one hit, and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in pre-federation australia. rating: 8/10
