not every line in a comedy is funny. this movie takes a serious subject, the disenfranchisement of voters and holds it up to the light while telling jokes about it. it's the movie the daily show would have made if they wanted to turn it into a movie. i found robin williams to be much funnier in this movie than he was in rv. and while my wife and i share a few opposing political views, we were both doubled over in laughter for several parts of this movie. the script writers here could give fox news some lessons in fair and balanced. lewis black was okay for his part, but never really seemed to be able to bring out his particular brand of comedy for his role. christopher walken was also good, playing his fairly common subdued supporting role, pushing a story along.
