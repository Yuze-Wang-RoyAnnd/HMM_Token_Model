i really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. it was very well directed. i think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as terry and bobbys and show them as people with emotions. as this film needed to show bobby as a cold and vindictive person.<br /><br />i agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. he didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. he should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together. some reviews say that she was naive, i think she was when it came to the adoption, however best actors all round. great movie to watch!!
