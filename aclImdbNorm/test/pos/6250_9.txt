i love this movie! when i saw this movie on tv when i was a kid,it scared the hell out of me.probably because mannequins give me the creeps too.jocelyn jones(molly)is an excellent actress.she uses her facial expressions,especially her eyes,at playing terrified.chuck connors is great as mr.slausen.i was happy to see him play such a different roll.the other actors in this movie are great too! tanya roberts(becky)and robin sherwood(eileen) are great actresses and i hope to see them in future films,especially jocelyn jones! <br /><br />so if you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old thing,check this movie out!
