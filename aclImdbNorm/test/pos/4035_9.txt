"d.o.a" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. dennis quaid is at his caustic best; and quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in hollywood. his then beau meg ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact.<br /><br /> the film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? the answer is no. the whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography. all these elements help to keep proceedings fresh.<br /><br /> really the greatest thrill here is to be had with the dialogue, it's snappy yet intricate, doesn't waste a word and yet still manages to be entertaining. the screenplay for this is like a pocket work of art.<br /><br /> this went unnoticed by me for ages before i finally caught it late at night. if this is the first you've heard about it, don't leave it like i did! catch it soon, it really is top-notch... !<br /><br /> if you're in the mood for a solid genre flick that manages to surprise at every turn, this really fits the bill.<br /><br />
