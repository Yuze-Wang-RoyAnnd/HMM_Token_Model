though several scenes of wirey spindell can be described as "over the top". i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near-taboo twisted comedy.<br /><br />wirey spindell is a great film with great dialog. i wouldn't say that this film is for everyone, but the film is on my top 10 list.<br /><br />if you can look beyond it's occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is, i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do.
