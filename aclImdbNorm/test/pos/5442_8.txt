a political satire of a comedian (williams) who after dissing the political campaigns and presidents is forced into the running. but shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office. "man of the year" is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work. williams again teaming with levinson after a hit with "good morning, vietnam". the two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other. i am not comparing them to scorsese and deniro but you can get the picture. although i wouldn't quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters i would recommend renting it. this movie is a comedy but also has a great satire, please if you like movies like "scary movie 4" this is not for you, take your brain with you to see it. - ***
