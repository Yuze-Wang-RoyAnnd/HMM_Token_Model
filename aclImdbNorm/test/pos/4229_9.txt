i was expecting this to be just like the others, tries to be scary- ends up looking silly. somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films. this feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the child's play series. the new idea works making this the best in the series by far.
