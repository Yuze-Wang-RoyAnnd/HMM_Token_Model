john carpenter's "the thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. sadly as with most carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic. it seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the "good" alien. an idea spawned after the success of "i.t.". and the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy. human ignorance is truly a frightening thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be.<br /><br />"the thing" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a u.s. antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (refered throughout the movie only as a "thing") able to imitate any form of life. not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. there is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be... not quite human.<br /><br />carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average sci-fi/horror. there are no "whats behind you?" jumping moments here. instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to rob bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films.<br /><br />instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach. by implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret-ate what has transpired in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies.<br /><br />ennio morricone's score works all the way. it's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. although i've always wondered how would it have sounded if carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his movies's osts except this one) did it? characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially kurt russel who plays the "down-out" apathetic helicopter pilot r.j. macready. its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie. from his disregardful "don't give a ...." attitude in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight "the thing". but even with that said, there are no false heroics here, there are no "laughing at the face of death" moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief, the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. speaking of which, here once again carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending.<br /><br />quarter of a century after its release "the thing" doesn't feel dated. and with the disturbingly growing use of computer-generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers. combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. a masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.
