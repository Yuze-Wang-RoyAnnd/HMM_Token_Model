this movie was great don't understand the disrespect it get's. i first scene this in like 87-88 and it was actually scary, if you are an 80's horror fan you should have no problem with this film it has everything that makes 80's horror great. i got to meet a few of the actor's and they were cool. what is not great about a creepy old house,demons,crazy party & horny good looking young people. the dialog and the special fx made this movie a classic. this film also took care of one of those classic rumors about horror the black guy does not alway's have to die in the end.even though this movie was great there is one thing that remains undiscovered to me what really happened to the old couple at the end was it on purpose or not that little side story thing alway's had me puzzled.
