when i went to the video rental store, back in the days when dvd was yet next to unknown to me, i had seen all the movies at the store that i was interested in. or so i thought! the man behind the counter told me he had something for me that i definitely would like. he gave me "plunkett and macleane". at first, i doubted it to be any good, but i trusted his advise and... man, i sure am happy i did take this jewel along! this is one of the best adventure movies in years, if you ask me! of course, with robert carlyle as a major part, how bad can a movie get? surely, liv tyler does once more what she's good at and nothing much more: being pretty. but still, you can very clearly sense that the cast apparently had a lot of fun, making this movie.
