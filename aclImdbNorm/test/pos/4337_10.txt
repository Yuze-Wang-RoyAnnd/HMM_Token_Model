death wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. terrible acting! implausible scenerios! ridiculous death scenes! creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! the last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. and how can i forget the elderly woman with the broom? she's sweeping out the scum! and if that's not enough, let's not forget how quickly the punks give up after fraker is killed. i'm laughing just thinking about it.<br /><br />i also love the death scene of kersey's girlfriend. he just *walks away* after seeing her get blown up. it's little things like this that make death wish 3 such a bad movie. and i'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack.<br /><br />i watched this movie because of martin balsam, who i seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever (and who's own "getting beaten up by the scum" scene is hilarious) and i walked away with a new favorite movie. thank you, death wish 3 for making me laugh so hard.<br /><br />some other things i forgot to mention: 1. the weird sound effect after kersey says "cash!" when buying his used car. ha! it's so evil sounding. 2. mandy fraker. mandy! did the writers run out of tough guy names? 3. the fact that the gangs apparently have a "lend and lease" thug exchange program: "i need some more guys." and that mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building. 4. at the end of the movie, after kersey blows up fraker: is it just me, or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as they're giving up? just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the "stop" signal. <br /><br />i love this movie. nothing cheers me up like death wish 3!
