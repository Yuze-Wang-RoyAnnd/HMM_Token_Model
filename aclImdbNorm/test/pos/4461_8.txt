lucio fulci's "don't torture a duckling" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.this surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.the soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;bruno's near-seduction by the naked patrizia(barbara bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite "house with the windows that laugh"(1976).
