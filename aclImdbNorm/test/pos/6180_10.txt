planktonrules comments must've been written on topsy-turvy day, because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth!<br /><br />'bluebeard's eighth wife' is hilarious in every scene, in every way -- the chemistry between colbert and cooper could not have been finer...supporting cast is superb.<br /><br />writing and direction are magnificent!!!<br /><br />like so many other comments on this board again i lament, "why can't films be like this anymore?" <br /><br />this is classic paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best, folks!
