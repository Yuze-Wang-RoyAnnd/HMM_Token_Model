when i first viewed the trailer,i have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. but after hearing about it,i decided to buy it. when i bought the entire collection in a box set,it was absolutely what i wanted to see. it was very funny,and the characters were pretty cool. favorite characters in the show are:marion,carrot,the haze knights,big momma,and dotta. i also liked the opening and ending theme songs. the show also has some great voice talents from tiffany grant,jason douglas,and others. but however,this show is one of the greatest. so if you want to see something cool. then this show is the one.
