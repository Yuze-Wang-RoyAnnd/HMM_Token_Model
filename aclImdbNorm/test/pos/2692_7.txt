i need help identifying an episode of king of queens. it begins with a scene where doug is talking to carrie on the phone, and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with "i love you." however, it's hard to do and he ends up calling her back, only to close with "i love you." it's a very clever moment and one i think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time.<br /><br />i think (but i'm sure) that's it's the same episode where doug gets some local construction guys to whistle and throw lurid comments at carrie to perk her spirits up.<br /><br />i saw this episode recently, but it was probably a repeat. don't know what network i saw it on. can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
