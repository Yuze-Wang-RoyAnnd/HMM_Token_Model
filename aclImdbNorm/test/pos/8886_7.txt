inspired by hitchcock's strangers on a train concept of two men swapping murders in exchange for getting rid of the two people messing up their lives, throw momma from the train is an original and very inventive comedy take on the idea. it's a credit to danny devito that he both wrote and starred in this minor comedy gem.<br /><br />anne ramsey is the mother who inspires the film's title and it's understandable why she gets under the skin of danny devito with her sharp tongue and relentlessly putting him down for any minor infraction. billy crystal is the writer who's wife has stolen his book idea and is now being lionized as a great new author, even appearing on the oprah show to bask in adulation he should be enjoying. thus, devito gets the idea of swapping murders to rid themselves of these nuisance factors.<br /><br />of course, everything and anything can happen when writer carl reiner lets his imagination roam with unending ideas for how the plot develops. and it's amusing all the way through, providing plenty of laughs and chuckles along the way, as well as a good deal of suspense.<br /><br />for devotees of black comedy, this one is guaranteed to please.
