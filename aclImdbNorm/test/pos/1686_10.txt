if there are people that don't like this movie, i don't think they are human. this film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of judith light's character. made in 1997, this is one of the best movies i have seen and really the film that judith light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. this movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. i cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me! the plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by judith light is incredible. she looks beautiful the whole time and by the end, you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. overall, a movie worth my highest praise! thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. i eagerly await this movie to come out on dvd or some other form of media since lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers. although i don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, since this movie is still ingrained into my head after all this time.
