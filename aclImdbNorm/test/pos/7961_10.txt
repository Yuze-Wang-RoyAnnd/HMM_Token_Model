last time i checked in here i think there was no more than one comment. i'm very glad that more people have caught on this flick now,and even more so about you all digging it as well. i caught this the night of christmas 2004,and i found myself unable to change the channel on my tv,even though it was an asian flick-and i'm-sadly but truly-very used not to give any chance to any off-hollywood products. i did that night,though,and i thank god deeply for it. i've not been able to shake that movie out of my system since-not that i've tried to or wanted to-and it still amazes me-in an extremely grateful way-that such a great,beautiful experience came in such a way,completely unexpected,like a christmas miracle.please,if you got the chance go see this movie,buy it or rent it of bootleg it or whatever,but watch it. i guarantee it will affect you. i'm out of time,but i'm far from finished with my appraissal here,so ill be back as soon as i can.
