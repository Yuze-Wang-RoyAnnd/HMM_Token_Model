plot spoilers!!!! dr. boch (george c. scott) is the chief of medicine at a major nyc hospital. he's left his wife, his children have disowned him, he's impotent, drinks a lot and contemplates suicide. also there's a killer roaming the hospital. then he meets very strange barbara (diana rigg) and falls in love. she wants him to run away with her--but can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one?<br /><br />very strange movie with an oscar winning script by paddy chayefsky. it presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors that is run incompetently. it manages (somehow) to actually make this seem pretty funny. it's not laugh out loud humor--it's very black humor. also the acting is right on target--scott is just great (and oscar nominated) here. you see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. riggs character is more than a little odd but her matter of fact manner works and she's also incredibly beautiful. the script is strong and brutal--but never too much. i think it fumbles the ball at the end with a situation that goes way too over the top--but it's still worth seeing. if this had been done totally seriously it probably would be impossible to take. also look for katherine helmond in a small bit and stockard channing and christopher guest in uncredited bits. i personally had trouble taking this seriously. from what i've heard hospitals were this bad back in the 1970s but not anymore. see it for the acting and script. i give it a 7.
