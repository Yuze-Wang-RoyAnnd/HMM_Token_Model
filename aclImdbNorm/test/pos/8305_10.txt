my father took me to see this film when it was released in 1976. i was but a child and it scared the crap out of me. so much so that i had to leave the theatre during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene as it was too intense for me!!! i went home to the safety of my family. i saw the film all the way through as i got older and thoroughly enjoyed it. shame about the men in monster suits, though. if you overlook the cheapness of the production and delve deeper, you'll find an excellent performance by cushing, a stunning opening score, some nice photography and the ever reliable mr.douglas mcclure, my childhood hero!british police constables guarding the whitehouse at the end! titty bang bang cave woman! monsters with beaks! actors in monster suits gliding on wires! this has it all! superb.
