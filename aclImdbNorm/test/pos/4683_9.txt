i enjoyed the movie very much. everything in the italian job is simple. an explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. this film is entertaining although it has no central idea. it is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. all the stunt work is gorgeous. from the speedboat chase in venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in los angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. the best boast chase i have ever seen. i like the mini coopers. the expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. the chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. they chased underground. i can say there was not a moment i was bored. mark wahlberg (charlie croker), charlize theron (stella bridger), donald sutherland (john bridger), jason statham (handsome rob), seth green (lyle), mos def (left ear) and edwin norton (steve) really did a good job. i like the actors in this film. i have seen a lot of heist movie but the italian job& is one of my favourites. a great hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. after all, i do love this kind of movie.
