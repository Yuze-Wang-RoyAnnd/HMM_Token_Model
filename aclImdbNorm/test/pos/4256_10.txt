if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, i doubt you will be disappointed. ps has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.<br /><br />i strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with spike lee's "bamboozaled" (sp?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (good filmmaking, disjointed script.)<br /><br />robert downy's direction is brilliant, allowing many of his actors to improvise, the film gets better as it goes along and the jokes swagger from hit or miss one-liners that are as forgiven as those found in a mel brooks comedy, to sheer non-pc 'i can't believe they just said that' fun.<br /><br />favorite parts, the commercials. the film switches from gritty black and white depictions of the ad agency to beautiful (perhaps 16mm) color and gets away with it. <br /><br />i refuse to hint at any spoilers, but if you get the chance to see the dvd version be sure and watch the downey interview (but leave it until after the movie.) <br /><br />my vote 10/10-- most underrated film of the late 60's, early 70's. thank you prince.
