i loved this film, which i have just seen at the philadelphia film festival. in march 2005 i went to india with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. i related to everything, and savored every moment. the characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. i also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. this movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (east and west). the supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in india quite realistically. the humor is subtle, and at times dry, and this makes it all the more realistic, as it is woven into the daily escapades of the characters. it is so easy to identify with each of the situations portrayed.
