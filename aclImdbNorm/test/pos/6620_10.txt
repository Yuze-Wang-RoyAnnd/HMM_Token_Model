if you have ever been, has a friend, or a kid that is or was into skating at one time, then watch this flick!. i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it. it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place (a long time ago) . it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters, well, skate. sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen, which the movie does touch on slightly. but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating. just a person on a board, doing it because they love to do it. this movie was so inspirational to me that i'm now skating once again (i'm 32) and i haven't been this happy with my self in years
