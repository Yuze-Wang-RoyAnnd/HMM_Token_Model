this truly is an australia cult classic. if you're one of the lucky ones to have seen it-- then you are very lucky. it has been released in most countries, but not in australia for some reason. i have a copy on dvd from the uk. not a great transfer, but i bought it, having seen it previously at a film festival. the directing is spot on and the performances rock! this is dark film scary film, but often times, very funny in parts. i urge you to see this film, there is a coolness about this you don't see in 99% of the typical aussie fare. the screenplay is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes, you just can't pick how badly. great work from the four leads, especially lachy hulme. <br /><br />when its all said and done: great work on display!
