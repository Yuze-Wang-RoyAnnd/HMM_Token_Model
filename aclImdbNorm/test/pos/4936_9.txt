one of my favorite movies of all times, have seen it three times already. it does a great job of summing up the isrelai walks of life, israeli humor, and seriousness, and much of the problems israelis go through. universal theme of wanting to be accepted, and be accepted for who you are. good subtle humor, and it's the charisma of the characters, that makes this movie magic, and says a lot about isrlaei culture, and the irnonicness, contradictions, and humor, with a great actor in it, oshri cohen. i highly recommend it to anyone, and it's a movie perfect for practically anyone, family movie, boyfriend/girlfriend movie, and also says apart from israeli culture, wanting to be accepted, most of all, how important family is, with all its diversity and imperfections.<br /><br />great great movie.
