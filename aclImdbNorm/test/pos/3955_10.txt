i recently saw blind spot in coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. i really admired the story and visual approach. the action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. there is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. not just in the desert but in the city too. my best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. you really feel for this guy. i never heard of the actors before but i liked all three very much. i think they did a terrific job on their journey to self-discovery. all in all, this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. i still carry many of the images in my mind.
