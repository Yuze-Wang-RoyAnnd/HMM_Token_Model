i've never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this, laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky+. i'm glad i did!! i hope i don't insult anybody (because basically, the bf and i loved it!) but we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did - especially the obsessed one (who, i understand, is a huge bollywood star because we've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in hamleys!! the bf keeps on about this bloke - i am beginning to think he's obsessed! he keeps saying that it's strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the anti-hero of a film! but then we do like films that aren't your stock predictable hollywood fare).<br /><br />it was completely over the top but really good fun. if all bollywood films are like this then we're watching more. i have had that bloomin' song in my head all week and i can't speak a word of hindi! ps any recommendations would be appreciated!
