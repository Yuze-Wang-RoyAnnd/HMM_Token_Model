i first saw this docudrama in the uk in the 1980's, and found myself intrigued and then astonished at how such good intentions could go so wrong. previous commentators (who are australian) have explained the unfolding plot's detail better than i ever could, but i would like to make an observation about what may lie behind the governor-generals 'uk sovereign power'. all modern laws, as i understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become a law at all. that being the case, and if say the conner's/khemlani mess had been possibly set up,(just how many businessmen/millionares had been served by khemlani, presumably without complaint), then the labour government could have been victims of 'entrapment', which would surely have had to have been investigated' by the governor-general as or until he could see that the budget standoff was a genuine result of whitlam's fecklessness, and not elaborate entrapment, sponsored by 'person or person's unknown'! if its the case that kerr in effect didn't have to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances overrides everything, then 'royal power' borders onto unreason; the implications in any commonwealth country is that 'fiscal' rules literally, and that any person or organisation has carte blanche to break any other rule, physical or mental, so long as they have the control over the purse strings ultimately!
