robin williams is a national treasure, specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama. he manages to liven up the usual restrained pacing of barry levinson, and there are moments in this film when he truly shines.<br /><br />as the funny elected american president in "man of the year" williams recaptures the hilarity and outrageousness that used to be associated with him. what makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability. here is a man who can lash at his audience but truly loves them, too. his humour is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. it is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life.<br /><br />laura linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress. she is a fabulous and very talented performer, but i think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. walken pretty much walks through his thankless role, and the climatic scene in the snl skit barely floats above water.<br /><br />go in for a few hilarious moments, and those are priceless. enjoy williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie.
