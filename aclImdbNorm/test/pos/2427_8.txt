what i find remarkable about this terrific film, is that altman, the crazy and wild guy that he is, took the novel that cold day in the park and the sandy dennis character was originally a male in the book. he was a mentally whacked out isolated gay who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted the hustler. it is strange that altman fans aren't aware of how clever he was to change the sex of the main character; thereby avoiding the homo erotic taboos of gay life in the 60's and actually making dennis' reclusive kind of madness work even better in the transposition.if you see the film again, it will be evident how wily the altman mind works...
