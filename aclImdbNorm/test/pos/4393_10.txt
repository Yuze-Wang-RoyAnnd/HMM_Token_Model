about the discussion on the south, the rednecks and the hillbillies... well, i am from the south: argentina, near the south pole to be exact. is this southern enough? seriously, some stories are universal. we have never been to greece, nor lived the classic period of homer, but he speaks to us today. so does shakespeare and dante. and stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensibility, intelligence, humor, just like "o brother". besides, we all (the rest of the world) have our own hillbillies too! and our own depression era (ever heard of argentina during year 2001?), our politicians and racism, our gentle souls just like delmar and tommy... i simply loved this movie, folks. despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (and please forgive my errors in english, i tried my best)<br /><br />ps: i believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase: when delmar asks george nelson what does he do for a living, while handling him the machine gun...
