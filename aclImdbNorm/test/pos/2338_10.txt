i just watched the dvd of this award winning film. one life stand is a stark drama that through it's pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very compelling and honest picture. it's a story about life's dilemma's around power, sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. the mother (very well acted by maureen carr) is uptight and drawn in on herself. the father only appears on the side-lines, and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama. money is hidden in boxes and shoes.<br /><br />the writing was superb, and i liked the sensual close-up shots of details such as nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors etc. the way the camera was used made it very intimate. it's a harrowing tale, with sexual undertones, while the glasgow drizzle on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters.<br /><br />there are some highly memorable shots conveyed simply by a walk, or a dropped shoulder - such as trise walking away under the bridge. and the stunned and hurt look on trise's face in the call centre, which hopes to helps people through using tarot cards, as she listens to a caller talk of her own abuse.<br /><br />at the start we see john paul, wide-eyed and innocent, having photos shot as he wants to try modelling. trise, his mother, is deluded and making poor choices for him, in a way pushing him away while she tries to keep him. john paul's modelling turns into escort work and trise's boss offers her money, and eventually they go on a date. there are also moments of humour and subtle irony. one excellent scene is when they are having a fairly normal meal, and starting to open up a bit, when the father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything over. but this, and other things offer moments of hope.<br /><br />i felt at times the pacing of the film was a shade too intense, but this is a small detail in another wise challenging and memorable film, and something a bit different. it stands in start contrast to most american films which are either total fantasy, or the real' world' as seen through tainted glasses. this film depicts life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images. <br /><br />this isn't 'light entertainment' but a thought provoking and real life drama.<br /><br />one life stand is a truly involving and emotionally honest film.
