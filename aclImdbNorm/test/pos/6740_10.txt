how many of us have read a book or seen a play, and then when the movie version came out we were terribly disappointed? well, maybe this would be one of those movies for those who saw the play too, but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage, i was extremely entertained by this movie. the characters were funny, the music was great, and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters, flaws and all. jonathan silverman has such good comedic timing, and his lines especially are hilarious. i'm not going to give any spoilers, it's just a nicely done, funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle class family during wwii. so if you never saw the play, and if you have enjoyed other neil simon movies, don't be held back by the couple of negative reviews seen here. on its own, brighton beach memoirs is a great movie. i guarantee it (no money back, though).
