long before terri schiavo brought the issue of living as a "vegetable" to the public view, "a day in the death of joe egg" dealt with it. alan bates plays bri, a schoolteacher whose daughter is almost completely brindled. he and his wife sheila (janet suzman) try all sorts of dark humor to try and get on with their lives, but they can't escape the facts. at one point, they even consider euthanasia. the question circling them and their friends is: what will ever become of this predicament? <br /><br />with this movie, alan bates continued his streak of really good movies, preceded by "zorba the greek", "the king of hearts" and "the fixer". we can safely say that he will be sadly missed.
