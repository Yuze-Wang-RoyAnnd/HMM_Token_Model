i liked this movie. unlike other thrillers you learn to know the killers very well. you also get to know the two detectives hunting them. the killers are two high school kids. they are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police so they plan the "perfect crime". we all know this crime will not turn out perfect. what we don't know is if they will be caught, or may be just one of them, or even none. in a way i kind of hoped they both would get away with it, although i don't know if this was the movies intention.<br /><br />the story is told in a nice way. you are starting to get to know the people involved. the character of sandra bullock is likable but has her own secret, which works against her. ben chaplin is pretty good as sam and the two kids are both great. the scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie.<br /><br />i think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think. for a nice evening with a movie, 'murder by numbers' is a good one.
