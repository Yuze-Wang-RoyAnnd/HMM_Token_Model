"the king of queens," in my opinion, is a pure cbs hit! despite the fact that i've never seen every episode, i still enjoy it very much. for that reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. even so, i must say that cbs really knows how to make a good sitcom. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. in conclusion, if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off cbs, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.
