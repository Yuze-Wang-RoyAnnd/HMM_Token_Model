i have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! it was funny and creative; i wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. it ranks right up there with winky dink - another favorite. i was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on rocky and bullwinkle. these early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances. while the early cartoons didn't address evil very much - it was a much gentler and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.
