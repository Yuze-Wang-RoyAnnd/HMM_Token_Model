during my trip in a youth leadership forum, i was channel surfing until i found "tommy boy" on tbs. since i have never seen this film before, i wanted to check it out. my roommate, who have already seen this, told me, "this movie is a classic." after seeing the whole movie, i came to the conclusion that he was right.<br /><br />"tommy boy" is constantly funny from beginning to end, thanks to the comedic duo of chris farley and david spade. farley is a riot as the title character, a spastic doofus who just sails through life as if it wasn't important. his slacker-esqe ways soon come to a halt when his father (brian dennehy), a wealthy "break pads king", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. this leads tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend richard (david spade), to hit the road to sell enough break pads to save the company.<br /><br />the main reason "tommy boy" works are the funny performances from the lead cast. farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person being spade and the third being rob lowe as the film's villain who has bad luck. another funny guy is dan aykroyd as ray zalinsky, a well-known auto parts extraordinare.<br /><br />another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes. chris farley has hilarious slapstick moments, and david spade has funny snide comments and one-liners. the gags in the movie (some which involves a deer and a airplane bathroom) are laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to director peter segal (naked gun 33 1/3), writers bonnie & terry turner<br /><br />(3rd rock from the sun, that 70s show), and the cast.<br /><br />"tommy boy" is a really funny movie, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including roger ebert) find it horrible and unfunny. (i wonder when their sense of humor died.) i recommend "tommy boy" for those who are great fans of comedy. thank you very much, roommate.
