anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love<br /><br />this film. taken from ronald 'taking sides' harwood, it's a funny<br /><br />and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two<br /><br />very 'actorly' types. albert finney is sublime as the despotic<br /><br />shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging<br /><br />around him, so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatre<br /><br />company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.<br /><br />tom courtenay is matchless as norman, the 'dresser' of the title,<br /><br />whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.<br /><br />really a must see.
