simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out. first: the part where he was set to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a golden shower!!! (i laughed so hard!)<br /><br />second: the part where he tried to prove worthy of a swimming school instructor. he seemed like a pro diving in, but as expected, he couldn't swim (proper at least^^). however the funny part of this was when he finally reached the end and said "how was that" or something. that was so friggin hilarious, i couldn't stop laughing. <br /><br />if you get the chance to see this anime series, i strongly recommend it. one of the best i've seen. <br /><br />definitely the funniest!
