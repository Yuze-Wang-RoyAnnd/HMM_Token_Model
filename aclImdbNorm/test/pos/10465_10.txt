this is one of those movies which get better with each viewing. i watched it three times and actually registered on imdb because i wanted to comment on it. movies "about food" have been done before, some of them are really good - as, for instance, a certain japanese comedy which aficionados of asian cinema will know anyway. but this one really is in its own league. at its core is a protestant christian parable symbolizing the ideal of kindness but, far from being dogmatic, it also addresses the "good" in each and every of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. there is a pervading understatement and refinement in babette's feast but this makes the message of the movie, if anything, stronger, not at all weaker. if you cannot attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by babette, you're still welcome to this feast of the soul. highly recommended!!
