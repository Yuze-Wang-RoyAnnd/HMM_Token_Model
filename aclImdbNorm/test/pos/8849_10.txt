a brilliant horror film. utterly gruesome and very scary too. the thing is a remake from john carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. it is simply brilliant. the start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'the thing'. one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.<br /><br />the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in antartica is visually impressive on dvd widescreen. it must have been great in the cinema. i regret not seeing this on the big screen.<br /><br />kurt russell is excellent as macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. i love it because its funny as well.<br /><br />special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. if he didn't get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.<br /><br />wait for a cold winter night. get some budweiser from the fridge. sit down and watch the thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.<br /><br />utterly brilliant.<br /><br />ten out of ten.
