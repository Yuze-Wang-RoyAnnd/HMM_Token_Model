i'm doing a thesis on blurring the boundaries: the female cross dresser and am using tipping the velvet the book as my main text, any comments on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as a performance, gender as a fiction, gender imagery, cross-dressing as an erotic fantasy and as revolution, the effect of the male costume etc etc would be much appreciated! but a bit off the point has anyone seen sergio toledo's 1987 film vera? its about a young lesbian possibly transsexual cross dresser..i'm dying to see it because i think it'd be really helpful...does anyone know where i might get a copy of it? i've tried amazon and a few other sites but no luck...
