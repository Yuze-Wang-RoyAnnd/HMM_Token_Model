the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. in fact the main character (pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. what follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film i've even seen. i saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "black orpheus") and have never forgotten it. i don't think i ever want to see it again--it was just too much. <br /><br />spoiler ahead!!!! the scene which will not leave me is when pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. you don't see her do it...but you get a quick glance at what she got out. it's almost 20 years later and just recalling that scene upsets me. spoiler end!!!!!<br /><br />the movie gets more brutal as it goes along and ends the only way it can. what's all the more harrowing is stories like this really did happen in brazil in 1981...and are still happening today.<br /><br />a harrowing brutal film...but it should be seen if you can handle it. i'm surprised this got an r rating--i've seen x rated film that are less graphic. a 10.
