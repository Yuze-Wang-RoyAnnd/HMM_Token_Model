a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a jeweller's shop. much of what follows reminds us of shakespeare's "a mid-summer night's dream" in which demetrius and lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. here max and lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice, and alice complicates things when she calls herself lisa. on top of the merry mix-up, max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another,too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film , i wasn't quite sure if i was in the present or the past.there is much running down corridors, stairways, through doorways, into elevators etc. i accept all that in a fast-paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? after four collisions it ceases to have any impact, if you'll excuse the pun. high marks for art design! the apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris. saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost exits at the same time. however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss. it can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love, like puck in a "mid-summer night's dream".
