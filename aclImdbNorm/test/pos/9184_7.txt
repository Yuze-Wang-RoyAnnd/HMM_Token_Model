not having seen the film in its commercial debut, we just caught with it via dvd. expecting the worst, "hitch" proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it. thanks to andy tenant's direction, the film has an easy pace, and while predictable, the comedy has some winning moments.<br /><br />hitch is a sort of "date coordinator" for losers like albert, who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk. yet, albert is a genuine guy who, without some professional help would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. enter hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome, and even though albert stays overweight and never gets to master social graces, he conquers us because he is a real, in sharp contrast with all the phonies making the rounds in manhattan.<br /><br />the basic mistake most production designers make, when preparing locales for hollywood films, is how out of touch with reality they are. the apartments in which they situate these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these. evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city dwellers would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies, let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them.<br /><br />will smith is a charismatic actor. he has a disarming way to charm without doing much. the surprise of the movie though, is kevin james, who as the overweight albert, not only win us over, but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with mr. smith. eva mendez is fine as the main interest of hitch. in minor roles we see adam arkin, amber valletta, michael rappaport, and phillip bosco, among others.<br /><br />"hitch" is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by andy tenant.
