well, on the day that rob schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not-at-all-wanted "deuce bigalow: european gigolo" (hmmmm....wasn't there a film called roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called eurotrip? and now there's deuce bigalow: male gigolo followed by sequel deuce bigalow: european gigolo.......i smell a pattern. perhaps soon there will be spiderman: european webs are hotter.....or not) i am writing about this much maligned (at time of release) film. i was one of those maligners, i must admit. i turned my nose up at it even while chris farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the snl cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94-'95, the norm mcdonald anchorship notwithstanding. films like happy gilmore, tommy boy, and black sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of spade-farley-schneider-sandler films. however i watched this film the other day, ten years after and 8 years after chris died and could not stop laughing. yes it's not particularly sophisticated. farley does what farley does (not unlike manny being manny) but his "van down by the river" motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not "wash enough" or "wear well-fitting clothes" or "use deodorant more than twice a week" translates well here as the ever self-effacing character who realizes he's not the brightest, not the best-looking, and could stand to lose a few pounds. all the same, he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to. and david spade just tosses off his snide one-liners as he did for "spade's hollywood minute" and basically stings farley's self-esteem. there's really not a whole lot more to say than that. i love the one scene when farley catches spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. can't remember what the first one is but the second one, they're lying in their hotel beds and farley says to spade, "do you like baseball?". spade mutters something inaudible in response and farleys says, "the new york yank-ees?" anyway farley does his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. if you like, you like it. i couldn't stop laughing.
