okay. to enjoy this silent comedy short you must suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film. if you can't then you'll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower. charlie chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code. unknown to each other, they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects. apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recuperate from these major surgeries and they looked just dandy right away!! okay, remember i said to ignore this, right?! okay, well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their spouse. okay,...now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises, the film gets really, really good.<br /><br />charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him. both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive. so, because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date. but, they both sneak back home--not wanting their spouses to know! anyway, they meet later and are quite attracted to each other. but what about the poor spouses supposedly at home? well, they both learn that the other is married and both anticipate their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other! late in the film, charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband--by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the hubby! it really is a laugh riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person! you really have to see it to believe it. however, the wife sees an ad with charlie's before and after photos and knows what's happening. in the end, they both feel pretty foolish!
