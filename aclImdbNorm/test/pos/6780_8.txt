i play this game exactly after i watch the trailer in old magazine advertise cd...<br /><br />the is very interesting and dark atmospheric (missing in nowadays games/movies). the game is set somewhere in the middle of the '90 in the spooky mysterious mansion. you play as adam randell and your quest is to free the soul of your death trapped father.<br /><br />the look of the game is doom-like, but very different type of game. a lot of a action, various puzzles, quests, mazes and many more interesting locations and characters are presented in this old classic game.<br /><br />the game will run only on windows 98 and there is no patch for windows xp.
