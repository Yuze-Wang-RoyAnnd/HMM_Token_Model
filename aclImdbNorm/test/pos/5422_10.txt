i have only seen this once--in 1986, at an "artsy" theater in minneapolis...but i remember it like i saw it a thousand times this morning. hilarious ("sawing for teens", playing scrabble with all "e" tiles), beautifully animated (taking off her eyes, shaking them back into position, then putting them back on), and poignant (the end of the world, the pettiness of a snit)...<br /><br />required viewing for the human race. calling this simply a cartoon is like calling the great gatsby nifty typing.
