whenever an idea was successful during those "golden days" of the silent movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although "reworking" is the term that is used. of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the movies or tv always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit movie or tv program.<br /><br />to this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple.<br /><br />this, the last silent laurel & hardy short, surely must have been quite well received; for angora love (hal roach/mgm, 1929) was reworked on the roach lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. we were treated to laughing gravy (roach/mgm, 1931), in which the goat was replaced with a cute, little puppy-dog. also, the weather is transformed into the dead of winter, in the middle of a blizzard. they also made other line-up changes with substituting landlord edgar kennedy with landlord charlie hall.<br /><br />the second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 reeler, the chimp (roach/mgm, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct circus, to which stan and babe were former employees. the circus paid off its employees with their assets and the boys received the chimpanzee as their final payday.<br /><br />back to our original 'victim', today's subject, angora love. recomember? the short starts off simply enough. the boys encounter the goat on the street and the nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after stan feeds a doughnut to her. the comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between l & h and slow-burn exponent, edgar kennedy, their landlord. the incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. and as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the landlord's quarters.<br /><br />in addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and landlord edgar's suspicions about laurel & hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throw-away gag, which may well have been missed by the censors. while admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex.<br /><br />its camera shot is made from inside the boy's room, over their shoulder. with edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "remember, this is a respectable establishment!" just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the landlord; followed by a uniformed sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! poodle schnitz!!
