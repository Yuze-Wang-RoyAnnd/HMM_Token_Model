movie about two australian girls--debbie (nell schofield) and sue (sue knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys.<br /><br />i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981. technically i was still a teenager (i was 19) so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted. script wise there's nothing new here. it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored. what i found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers aren't much different than american teens. they had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and (i heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well-made and pretty interesting. so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids. i give it a 7.
