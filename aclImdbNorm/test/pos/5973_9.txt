i agree with another reviewer, this is such a shattering film, that will be tough to watch again soon, though for quality alone, it deserves repeated viewing. the complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watching.<br /><br />there is one scene, of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol, that's perhaps, for sheer physicality, the most amazing performance i've ever seen. in fact, though not episodic -- the story flows -- this is a movie of memorable scenes. there's the passing of rations amongst the partisans, the snow scenes, the ruined farm scene, the encounters in the houses, the interrogation, the "basement" scene, the "ascent". all stand out like jewels in a necklace.<br /><br />for me, the religiosity isn't overt. frankly, i don't think it would have been permitted in a soviet film. i do see this as an existential parable about the value of life. here is a tale where the hero -- and he is a true hero -- becomes the villain, and the weaker one becomes the stronger one. is this a mystical process or one dictated by circumstances? there is a transfiguration, but does it come from within or without? you must see the movie to understand the issues, for they can't be discussed without giving away too much of the story. i can't say enough about the acting. it's hard for me to choose which of the leads is more affecting. i'm not familiar with soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all superb. i also note how director larisa shepitko uses children. they remind me of giotto's child angels.<br /><br />there is a little muddling in the end. there is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier sotnikov and the interrogator portnov, but this is left dangling. and the final scene is a bit ambiguous. but compared to the total experience these are quibbles. this is a movie that will mark you for life.
