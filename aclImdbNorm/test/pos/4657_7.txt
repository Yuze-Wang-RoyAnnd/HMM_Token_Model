i had completely forgotten about "midnight madness" until just now when i found it while surfing the imdb. now, it's all coming back to me....<br /><br />it was one of naughton's first movies (as well as fox's) and sharp-eyed connoisseurs will also pick out kaplan (henry from tv's "alice"), fiedler (he does the voice of piglet in the "winnie the pooh" cartoons) and blocker (son of dan "hoss" blocker from tv's "bonanza").<br /><br />but the two that stand out in my mind are furst (from "animal house") and the superdude himself - eddie deezen. furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad, "why can't you just accept me for who i am?" his dad looks over his obese, slovenly frame and gives a simple, one-word response - "yuck!"<br /><br />and deezen... well, he's a show in himself. as a latter-day jerry lewis he stumbles around, wades through mini-golf ponds, puts melon halves on his ears and ends up having maggie roswell fall for him. my hero.<br /><br />as for the film, it's typical early-'80s stupidity with college kids staying up after curfew and going on a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus: the jocks, the nerds, the rich kids, the feminists or the group made up of a little of each. <br /><br />who wins? who cares, you'll have a lot of fun watching disney pictures' first foray into pg territory before creating touchstone pictures.<br /><br />seven stars. catch "midnight madness" any way you can!<br /><br />long live leon!
