i suppose it's quite an achievement to be able to present to an audience a true tail about a frail man; a tail in which the protagonist will spend the majority of the film on his back, in a bed and totally unable to move. and yet the achievement is in the film's effectiveness as a dramatic piece; as a recollection of a true story and i guess as an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so wish to. but the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it shies away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway. more-so, this is one of those foreign language films that presents its lead character as a cripple whom can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet is able to come across as engaging and compelling anyway.<br /><br />so rather than be an out and out argument, the film is more a sweet yet timely dramatic piece about another person wanting something or in search of something; the only difference is that by attaining this 'goal', it would mean the termination of a someone's life and it would be achieved by not physically going anywhere. javier bardem plays real life galician ram'on sampedro, an individual who at a much earlier age dived into a clearing of water that was too shallow for such activity. this rendered him bedridden for the rest of his life and his wish to die is the focus of chilean director alejandro amen'abar's film. we've seen so many films in our lives in which characters have certain 'goals' or targets one must meet before the film is over to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience, but the change of pace in the sea inside is gentle; it does not involve young, energetic, attractive heroes going off to do battle in far off places but a real person after something that means so much to them.<br /><br />even if you do have a strong policy, either pro or anti-euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping ram'on gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway. the film sets its tone very early on with ram'on giving a speech on why he wants to die to watching family members, immediately introducing the situation and subject to the watching audience who may not know what the film is about. interestingly, some of the family members are 'anti' what he wishes which might place any audience member that feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes. but the purpose of this set up is to tell the audience 'no, this isn't one man after something who incidentally has the whole of his family backing him to the end'. quite easily, the film could've gone down a route in which it is the sampedro family vs. everybody else but some are anti-ram'on's idea; some are too young to acknowledge what's really going on and others are seemingly too distraught to even have an opinion other than they just want ram'on to stick around a bit longer, they love him after all.<br /><br />the sea inside is a following of a story revolving around a victim of sorts. ram'on is a quadriplegic and it is his perspective we see things from. this is something that may disjoint viewers or have the film come across as quite odd given we are being presented with a film from the point of view of a victim rather than an instigator or a lead character in a film that is always inducing the cause in the cause and effect drive. but this is no criticism and it's a credit to the director for delivering such an approach in the effective manner in which it is. the film asks questions; it offers a scenario to its audience. if you were in ram'on's position: what would you do, or think about or dream of or talk about? consequently, dreams about lawyer juila (rueda) are not so much shot for the audience's pleasure as much as they are an ever so slight window into one man's escapist fantasies from his predicament.<br /><br />the study of julia intensifies somewhat later on when a she begins to share certain similarities with ram'on and that is when she begins to have strokes that are a result of a disease of her own. this trait seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds a further ingredient of connection on top of an already engaging friendship. this is because julia feels the physical pain and restriction, not in a sense that she isn't able to get up and walk, but i think she realises the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt beforehand. while the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it feels like more of a down to earth drama about a man in a situation in which he is prepared to fight for what he wants but must do so verbally. it's refreshing to see films like the sea inside as it not only references history and gives us an insight into that but as a stand alone film, delivers on an emotional and engaging level.
