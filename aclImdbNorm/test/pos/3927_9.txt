i've never seen the original "house of wax" so i really didn't know what to expect when i went to a sneak preview of the new film. after a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, "house of wax" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.<br /><br />the plot really doesn't matter too much here - i think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. it's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch. viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here, but there are other ghoulish effects as well. the production design and sets are excellent, and the cast makes the most of their under-written roles.<br /><br />of course, many people are probably wondering just how paris hilton's performance is. to be honest, hilton acquits herself quite well, and she doesn't portray "herself," as so many people are predicting. her character is sexy and sweet, and i think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people's opinions about her. elisha cuthbert is also good, moving up from her previous movie, the atrocious "the girl next door." her character is put through a lot, and cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine. chad michael murray, like hilton and cuthbert, is pretty to look at, but unfortunately is not very convincing as the "bad boy" of the group.<br /><br />i predict good things for "house of wax," as the audience at the screening i attended hollered, screamed and clapped through out many parts of the movie. congrats to the cast and crew for a job well done.<br /><br />and a congrats to paris hilton for proving a lot of people wrong. like she always says - "that's hot."
