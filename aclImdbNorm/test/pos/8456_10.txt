when the china syndrome was released, plenty of right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blasted this film, particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power. but it only took two weeks and a near-catastrophic accident at three mile island to shut those critics up.<br /><br />fonda and douglas are the l.a. news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the ventana nuclear power plant. douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass; but the tv station will not air the footage, fearing a massive lawsuit. it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth, despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident.<br /><br />but a conscientious shift supervisor (jack lemmon) has uncovered certain defects in the plant's pump support structure. he believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, though it would be extremely costly and lengthy, if repairs aren't made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. but he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story. the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political, technological, and human interest stories together in one disturbing package.<br /><br />while obviously quite politically liberal in nature, the china syndrome, well directed and co-written by james bridges (the paper chase), is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together. fundamentally, nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect. that is what the film is saying; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, it says it brilliantly.
