this series, while idealized and fictionalized, has the quirkiness, sultriness, and good-heartedness that does come from living on an island.<br /><br />i lived in an out of the way part of hawaii for a few years and found some hilarious, quirky, and fun people in some remote (non-tourist) areas.<br /><br />every time i see the reruns of this series, i fondly compare my memories of experiences in out-of-the-way parts of hawaii with the memories portrayed and fictionalized in key west.<br /><br />this series is not reality television. i hate reality television.<br /><br />it is from the era when people still wrote creative tv shows. give me a "young writer" who takes their inspiration from the "angels in the spray, wizards in the palm trees and elves in the seashells" any day.
