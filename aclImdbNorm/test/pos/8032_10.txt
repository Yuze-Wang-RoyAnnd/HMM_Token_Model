2002's the bourne identity is one of my all-time favorite movies. however, many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book's plot.<br /><br />the assignment is the real deal. it's odd that no-one on the "bourne identity" threads has mentioned this movie at all. (well, i jst did.)<br /><br />besides the excellent plot, i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i've ever seen, with the possible exception of the bourne<br /><br />identity itself.<br /><br />the action is all completely realistic. i especially liked the protagonists' training regimen, which was very inventive.<br /><br />the feel is dark and gritty. there are a few surprising plot twists. the acting is excellent. <br /><br />if you like this genre, i cannot recommend this movie highly enough.
