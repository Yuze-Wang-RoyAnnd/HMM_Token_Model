this is one of the anime films from the animatrix collection, one of nine - the only one done in black and white, and the only one featuring trinity. richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, and the animated version of trinity definitely does her justice. if you're a fan of the matrix, you will need to put this on your short list.
