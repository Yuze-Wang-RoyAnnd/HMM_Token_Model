though not hal hartley's best work (my personal favorite is "surviving desire"), there is still much to like about this movie, especially for fans of hartley's dialogues. even to audiences new to hartley, i would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric "dogma." this movie is more intelligent, truer to its source material (the bible), and more fun than any of the other pre-millennium apocalypse movies.<br /><br /> this movie is actually part of the french "2000 as seen by." (2000 par vu) series; as such, it is perhaps even a lower-budget film than hartley's other works. while the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry/jittery effect. i'd be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again; especially at the beginning, it almost makes the movie unwatchable. but overlook this flaw, and you'll be treated to a fine film. especially notable is magdalena (played by p.j. harvey) relating how jesus saved her from being stoned to death; a short scene i found surprisingly moving. (despite the fact that it was not mary magdalene that this happened to; the woman in the bible was unnamed.)<br /><br />
