this is a modest ,unassuming traditional western with a formulaic plot about opposition between ranchers and crop farmers around the town of liberal ,kansas .the story is essentially routine and features a number of the classic western conflicts .there is the farmer versus the cattleman;there is the clash between cultivated land and "civilizing" tendencies on the one hand and the wilderness/frontier ethos on the other and what this represents ultimately is the opposition of two value systems -democratic and community values as set against rugged individualism .<br /><br />randolph scott plays legendary lawman bat masterton who rides into liberal at behest of a land agent (robert ryan ) to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard drinking ,brawling cattlemen .the two men quarrel but reunite to tackle the troublesome elements in the town .<br /><br />the script is clich'ed but the action is propelled along with vigour by director ray enright and there are solid performances all round .in addition to rugged performances by the male leads there is comic relief supplied by george gabby hayes ,an oily villain nicely played by steve brodie and attractive contributions from maggie meredith as a prim and proper easterner wooed by ryan and anne jeffreys as a saloon singer as long as you do not place a premium on originality this is good sturdy entertainment for western lovers
