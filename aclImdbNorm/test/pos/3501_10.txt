the thing with ali g is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. <br /><br />the humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.<br /><br />personally i totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. you can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. the humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. the humour is probably very english, and specifically london, so its possible that non-english viewers may not get some of the humour. think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it - especially if the likes of kevin & perry go large tickled you!
