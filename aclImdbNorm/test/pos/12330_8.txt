i can't describe the feeling when i got this crappy vhs rental cassette in my hands about 20 years ago. somehow i got my father to rent it for me and i watched it twice with my little brother. yes, we got nightmares. this film was originally rated as pg in the us, in many other countries, including finland, it was restricted under 18 or 16. the film was aimed to teenagers, but this must be the goriest pg-rated film ever. there's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever. originally made in 1981, stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release.<br /><br />this is an a-class b-movie, a true, well made 80's horror flick. a bunch of college girls decide to spent a night in a mausoleum, not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits... <br /><br />you can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie. it's campy, utterly stupid, but they just can't make these movies anymore. there is definitely a certain feel to this 80's horror genre. this one is still effectively spooky and entertaining after all these years.<br /><br />the effects are just oozing quality by ellis burman jr and thomas r. burman. the make-up effects play a big part in this flick, otherwise it would've been just a boring teen slasher.<br /><br />it's now available on dvd at last and it's a special edition dvd including some extras too. commentary track is interesting.<br /><br />(in fact, this version isn't so special after all. below average transfer on dvd, some glitches and scratches here and there) at first it was going to be released by the blue underground but unfortunately it was canceled, so shriek show released it without restoring the print. too bad!)<br /><br />great date-movie!<br /><br />recommended!!!<br /><br />note! i only gave 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
