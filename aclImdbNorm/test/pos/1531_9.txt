this movie took me by surprise. i first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me still. it's got it's just plain boring points, and i, personally, would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others. the acting is _fantastic_. the cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, "what the hell is this?", and allow themselves to be drawn in should give this film a chance. if you just want alan rickman to be goofy or to see things explode this is not the movie for you.
