it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore, thought this movie was a good thriller.<br /><br />could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists. i had real reservations before seeing this movie (because of the cover). i was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory. i was wrong.<br /><br />although there is a lot of scary parts, there is a lot of suspense and drama too.<br /><br />the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick. the characters were believable<br /><br />the movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll<br /><br />because of its production values (the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.
