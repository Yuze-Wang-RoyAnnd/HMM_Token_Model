i've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. a christmas classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. the story line is simple : elisabeth lane (barbara stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. at christmas time, her boss, alexander yardley (sydney greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the connecticut farm she write about. the only problem is : she hasn't got any farm and she can't cook. to get out of the jam, elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (reginald gardiner,who has a farm) and flies for connecticut with her wonderful cook uncle felix. <br /><br />there's a fine direction by peter godfrey and the cast is really wonderful : stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman. greenstreet, gardiner and sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters. the only weak point is the leading man, dennis morgan. he starts well but as the movie goes on, becomes really a bore. one almost feels sorry for elisabeht lane to ends up with him rather than with gary cooper or david niven who both would have been more suitable for the part. anyway, this is a joyful christmas time movie with a refreshing score and i advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet holidays...in connecticut.
