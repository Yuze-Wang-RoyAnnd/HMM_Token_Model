recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesn't sentimentalise the main characters. david tennant and sarah parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident.<br /><br />tennant, as alan, brings humour as well as a dangerous lecherousness, as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident. alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life. sarah parish's tricia is not a clich'ed stand-by-her-man housewife who will do anything to support her husband. she struggles with falling out of love with alan, as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her.<br /><br />contrary to some opinion, this - in my view - makes perfect sunday night viewing. too often, we are shown soft family dramas or detective series, like heartbeat, which rot and putrefy the brain. programme commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep. more challenging and thought-provoking drama like recovery would seriously change the situation.
