it's about time "kate jackson" got her credit for this film.., i can remember watching it & trying to understand it on tv.., my grandmother lay in bed dying from cancer & i was barely 15. i didn't find out till years later that richard long had died tho.., i miss him on the other shows/movies he was in.<br /><br />i have a copy of the vhs tape still but it's not "cc'd" or closed captioned for the hearing impaired & thats the only flaw in the movie that i can remember or know of to date.., i haven't been able to find a dvd or vhs copy that has sub-titles in english even. if someone out there knows of either copy on vhs or dvd thats cc'd or has english sub-titles please let me know.<br /><br />thanks - cofffeenut
