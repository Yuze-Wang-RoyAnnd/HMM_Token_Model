when i first bought this movie, i had my doubts about it, even though the cast was pretty impressive. but after seeing it, i really do not regret spending the money. in fact, i'd love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this.... an absurd combination of humor, drama, thrill and the big questions. this is exactly what makes it a great movie. okay, some might not enjoy what they see, and some might even turn it off after a little while. your loss. it's got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues we've all been through in one way or the other, and the characters you think you won't enjoy the company of throughout the movie, turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while. for anyone with an open mind, and a sense of humor and living - watch this movie, i promise you you won't be disappointed!
