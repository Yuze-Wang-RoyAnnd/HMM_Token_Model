i chose this movie really for my husband-who works in radio broadcasting. i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate too, though it was from the eighties-so it was a little dated. this movie really draws you in. at times you just want to strangle the host, barry. at times you just want to send some of the bigots who call in to a true concentration camp. at times you really feel sorry for barry, because he has truly gotten too big for his jeans if you know what i mean. it was on the drama channel on encore-so i am thinking this is a true story. if you truly love dramas you will love this, even if you don't know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business. if you are an alec baldwin fan and are watching it to see him, you shouldn't. his part is really a bit part in this movie.
