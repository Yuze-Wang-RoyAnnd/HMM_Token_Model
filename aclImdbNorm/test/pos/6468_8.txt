a skillfully directed film by martin ritt where a drifter and anti-hero, john cassevetes lands in n.y. to escape a tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in an automobile accident as well as going awol from the army.<br /><br />cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grit in his portrayal of a film. am surprised that montgomery clift didn't get this part.<br /><br />ruth white is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the telephone.<br /><br />once in new york, he befriends sidney poitier as the two work on the docks. immediately, jack warden, a bully and villain in this film,takes a dislike to him and tragedy ensues when poitier tries to defend his friend.<br /><br />ruby dee, plays poitier's wife in this film, and is brilliant in a scene where she urges cassavetes to reveal the killer of her husband.<br /><br />this is definitely an interesting film of moral values and the loner in society. with the backdrop of tenements, the right mood is depicted in the film.
