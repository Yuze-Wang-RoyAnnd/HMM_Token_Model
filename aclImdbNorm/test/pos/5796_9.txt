forget every spy movie you've ever seen - this is what life was like in the ussr, and still is in many places in russia and the ex-soviet countries. vera dreams of life of leisure, as she imagines the west to be; her reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father, and the ever-present alcohol. and her prospects for the future are not much better. she finds a man and they try to patch up a life together, but he is afflicted by the same environment, both socially and physically - the scenery in this movie is brilliant, sitting comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic movies but obviously done with no special effects; they have just walked in and shot whatever happened to be in front of the camera.<br /><br />forget your stereotyped, cold russians of spy movies. this is the real deal: people are passionate, vibrant, and present in a way you'll never see in a drama from the west.
