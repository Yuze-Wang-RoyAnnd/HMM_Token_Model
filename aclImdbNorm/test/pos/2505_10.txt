this is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with kate capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. first off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy! for the cast, capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. tom everett scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful ellen degeneres is hilarious! blythe danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too. although it was unsuccessful, the film is great as it is both short and sweet and well as very romantic. 10/10
