i would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old. who can forget some of the best lines in film history? --- johnny's fat boy burgers!! johnny's fat boy burgers!! and look between the giant melons! i used to wish i could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this. it's an all-time fave and i'm happy to hear that it's out on video! i'm positive that this is where mtv got its original premise for the road rules series.
