i think gerard's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head. interesting film, but very long. it's definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy, sexy, moore-style docs. there is no narrator, no facts or side info interlaced, and no other gimmicks. what you see is what you get - a glimpse into the vanishing world of the saltmen of tibet. as a huge doc fan, i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film, namely due to the length and lack of dialogue. in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you. it's beautifully shot, informative, and presents a valuable (and closing) window into the way of life of the tibetan saltmen (and women :) - all important attributes of a good doc. but do put on a big pot of coffee, it'll help.
