first off i want to say most of the people who give this a poor review don't like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and aren't afraid to laugh at some stupid things.<br /><br />this movie is shot just like the tv show with a lot of short clips compiled into one long movie. some of the scenes don't even have dialog someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it is funny!! the only negative i had is i felt like i wasted money on my popcorn and icee, there was no way i could eat or drink anything during this movie i was constantly laughing. i was honestly nervous of drinking some icee and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it everywhere.<br /><br />if you don't mind some male nudity, and you enjoy jackass the movie, jackass the tv show, and viva la bam, then for your sake go see this movie.<br /><br />and if you don't like the first movie, or the tv show. don't see it, and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it. hardcore christians who see this and bash it just doesn't seem right to me.
