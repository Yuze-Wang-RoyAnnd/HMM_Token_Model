apparently this movie was based on a true story. i'm not sure how accurate it is, though. but it really reminded me of how when i see that someone has been murdered on the news, it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me. sure, i think it's terrible, but i honestly don't care. i move on. it seems that murder is trivial now. this is what river's edge shows. nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. then what's the point? <br /><br />the killer in this story is john, and for the large amount of the movie he hides out with another killer named feck, played by dennis hopper. feck is older, and you can see the generational gap. he says he loved the girl that he killed. when he asks john if he loved the girl he killed, he simply replies, "she was okay." the movie only seems to offer one solution: life is more important than death. a character's life is spared, people get second chances, and one hopeless case is killed.<br /><br />the acting is really good. after watching this movie i could only come to the conclusion that crispin glover is either a brilliant actor, or a terrible actor. i still have no idea. he was my main reason to see this movie, though. but the best performance is clearly given by dennis hopper.<br /><br />even though the fashion is really 80's and characters sometimes mention then-current issues, i still think river's edge is as relevant today as ever.<br /><br />my rating: 10/10
