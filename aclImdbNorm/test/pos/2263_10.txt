i first saw this movie on an alaska airlines flight, and have since seen it twice more. it simply is -- and is simply -- one of the best films in years. i found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing, but a little cloudy on what had happened. after seeing it again a few weeks later, things began to fall into place. it wasn't confusing, just deep. in fact, the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time. for example, it occurred to me only after my third viewing that sammy davis jr jr (grandfather's dog) is more than just a pet -- perhaps she's the stand-in for his dead wife. witness how fiercely he protects her. there is symbolism galore, and none of it sappy or indulgent, just real. the adventure of their trip keeps the story-line in perpetual motion, and even when they arrive, you're not sure if it really was the destination. as the movie continues, so does the adventure and i got the sense the destination was merely a way-point. the sound-track is fun, the scenery compelling -- and both decidedly eastern-block. i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film, but i'm not entirely sure i've discovered all the nuances yet. besides, it's more fun to tease these out yourself. as much as any film can be, "everything is illuminated" has proved to be like a fine wine that sweetens with time. i highly recommend seeing it -- twice.
