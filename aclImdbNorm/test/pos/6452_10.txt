city streets is amazingly modern technically speaking for a movie made in 1931. also who could not be mesmerized, enthralled by gary cooper's powerful magnetism, galvanizing the audience attention. the plot is quite elaborate and clear. the scenarios, decor, are exceptional in every detail. all the actors are above average. i keep guessing how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could have been so brilliant. i couldn't find a flaw, understanding that the scenes in the road(bumpy ride) with the large motion pictures screen on the background was the best they could get in 1931. all in all i found this movie superb and so much alive thanks to gary cooper charisma.
