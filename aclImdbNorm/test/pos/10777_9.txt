oliver stone hits the bull's eye with this film, aided chiefly by bogosian's electrifying screen presence and biting, brilliant screenplay. every moment crackles with a steadily-growing tension, climaxing in a truly, memorable movie-going experience. if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it! the result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.<br /><br />an ultimate indictment of our society's increasing morbidity, and self-sickening hunger for the next big thrill.<br /><br />a film not easily forgotten. i highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature.
