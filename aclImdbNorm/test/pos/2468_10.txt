i was just lucky i found this movie. i've been taking advantage of walmart's $5.50 dvds, because i watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television). i graduated from high school in 1968 - so i have family and many friends who served in vietnam. this movie really illustrates the pain i've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. i wish more people would see this movie - i think maybe more people could understand what happened to our vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war. the story felt realistic - it isn't mushy, but made me feel what they were going through. i think it helped that martin sheen and emilio estevez were playing father and son - it made their relationship more believable,
