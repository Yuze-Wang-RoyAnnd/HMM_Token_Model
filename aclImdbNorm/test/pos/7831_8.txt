ladies and gentlemen, we've really got ourselves a winner here. actually we don't, but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker. poor alma (fetching julia ruiz) is suffering from an ancient mayan curse that causes lethal poisonous snakes to grow inside of her body. alma and her deranged shaman husband brujo (alby castro, who feverishly overacts with delicious eye-rolling intensity) stowaway on a train that's bound for los angeles. naturally, a bunch of deadly vipers get lose so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers. the mallachi brothers, working from an absurd script by eric fosberg, treat the ridiculous premise straight, thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of deliriously campy cheese. the cruddy cgi effects, the pathetically unfrightening common variety gardner snakes (there's would-be scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace), the plodding pace, the total dearth of any tension or momentum, the obvious rickety stage-bound train set, and especially the simply astonishing "you gotta be kiddin' me!" over-the-top preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw-dropping awfulness. better still, we also got game (if lame) acting from a no-name cast, a nice smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver score, and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make-up f/x. bonus points for the fact that the token irritatingly cutesy little girl gets eaten by a large reptile and for the stoner engineer who gets caught smoking crack out of a hollow light bulb (!?). an absolute gut-buster of a kitsch howler.
