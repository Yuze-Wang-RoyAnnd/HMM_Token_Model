this review may contain spoilers! the decline of western civilization......what a great title eh? and of coarse a great movie. this is the best concert film i have ever seen. a close second being the talking heads movie "stop making sense". i first heard of this movie when waynes world came out in 1992. i looked at the director's name penelope spheeris and thought cool name, what else has he directed? i thought the first name was pronounced like envelope. after some time looking in movie guides i came across the critically acclaimed decline and realized penelope was a woman.....my mom corrected me. i spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down. i finally saw it on vhs in vancouver, where i currently reside. it was worth the wait. this captures the la punk movement very well. this is teen angst at it's best folks. my favourite is the band the germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because darby crash sings so crazy, you cannot understand it. i laughed when i saw this. the band black flag live in an abandoned church and the band x are a very intelligent bunch. also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to slash magazine about how we do not need to save the whales, there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in! i became a huge penelope spheeris fan after this, and saw all her punk movies-dudes was ok, and suburbia is a cult classic! i own both of these on vhs. she is a true underground film maker and i love her stuff. i would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular. i was a big nirvana fan then, but alas i saw this in 2002 and by that point i had grown out of grunge and now i listen to crystal method/fatboy slim. quite a change of pace, i know, but what can you do? but if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything. much better than 1991: the year punk broke. this is a tough movie to track down, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you don't like the music it is an excellent piece of work. now days it might be easier to find with dvd's being so popular. by the way penelope produced a little known albert brooks movie called "real life" which i also own. very funny stuff in todays reality tv craptacular! rent decline......highly recommended! thanks!
