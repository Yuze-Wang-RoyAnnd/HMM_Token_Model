what a great movie this was. is it heaven? hell? or something in between? i disagree with many reviews of this movie saying that this is a depiction of hell. it is not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback from the end. further, it is not clear that the main character goes to hell, but perhaps someplace in between. the review i read on imdb says this is hell, but i disagree whole-heartedly. take into consideration that perhaps good people who commit suicide may not be condemned to hell...this only one religious belief. this is indeed a thinker, and i have/would recommend it to anyone who likes that type of movie. definitely worth it!
