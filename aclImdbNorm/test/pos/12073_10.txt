i have nothing but praise for this movie and cast, especially ann margaret. but more importantly i have praise for my in-laws who were (are) the adoptive parents of warren and frank in real life. i met most of the "children" at warren's wedding in 1989. this is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through. it is also enjoyable for me to see how my in-laws were portrayed in the movie. it was pretty accurate. my wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. yes, it is a hard movie to watch, but so amazing and heartfelt.<br /><br />the beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my in-laws lives and, as a result of marrying their daughter,and having warren as a brother-in-law, how many i have met in mine. for the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my mother-in-law has shared with me. that and knowing warren. for what it is worth, warren lives in california with his family. he married his high school sweetheart, who he reconnected with at his 20 year high school reunion.<br /><br />there was a show in the 1980's called "that's incredible." they had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show.<br /><br />for anyone's interest, the dvd is available in great britain and australia. it is a tough video to come by here in the united states and i have not been able to find a dvd here, yet.
