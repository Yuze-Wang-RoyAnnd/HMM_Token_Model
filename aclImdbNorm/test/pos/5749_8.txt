id just like to say that the film was good and touching. the film explains to you the real meaning of being saved or born again and is very well set out. the acting was quite good but could do with some improvements. the story board is catchy and when my church had youth service and we watched it,8 people gave there life to christ. id just like to say too anyone who is reading this, give your life to christ and repent from your sin. please visit www.lifeofacristian.piczo.com thank you andrew<br /><br />the word of god will not turn void. so get saved and repent from your sin!
