like all of the very earliest films, this "movie" is very, very short--lasting about one minute! so, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. but, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. i've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout. i think the red one depicted on the dvd "the great train robbery and other primary works" is the best of them. the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art. and, unlike other one minute (or less) films of the day, this one is one i could see repeatedly--it's just that visually compelling and odd.<br /><br />if you want to see it online, there is a 36 second version on google video (type in "serpentine dance").
