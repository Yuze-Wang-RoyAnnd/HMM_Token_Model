being in the suburbs of new york when the z-boys were creating history in dogtown, i was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on. i had a p-o-s black knight skateboard with clay wheels. it is long gone, and on the ash heap of my personal life. but i never forgot. it's like watching long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where i live. i cannot watch this film enough. every time i view it, some other aspect rises to the top, some other viewpoint come into sharp focus. the vintage footage, the incredible stills, the current personalities intermeshed with the vivid shadows of the brightly lit past, the heartfelt and not over-done narrative, all beautifully edited together in such a way as to make a landmark documentary of a genuine slice of american history. in the words of glen friedman - "it was f-ing unbelievable."
