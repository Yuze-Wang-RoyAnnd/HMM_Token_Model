a masterful performance by jamie foxx is just one of the highlights of "ray," a 2004 film also starring kerry washington, regina king, curtis armstrong, richard schiff, sharon warren, patrick bachau, and many others, all giving excellent support to the film.<br /><br />the film has several main focuses: the first is charles' childhood - the drowning of his brother george which haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught him by his mother - don't bend, don't break, don't ever be a cripple. she eventually sends him to a special school where charles' gift of music is discovered. the next focus is charles' artistic evolution as a nat king cole-like singer, to his arrangements of gospel music, his foray into country music, and the unique sound that became ray charles. the third focus is charles' personal life - his marriage to bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation.<br /><br />because charles lived a packed 74 years, there's a lot skipped. though charles was orphaned while in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, isn't in the film. while he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician isn't covered. at one point, he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it, but the jar broke. he was that down and out. bea is shown with him when the state of georgia, which banned him, adopts "georgia on my mind" as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes charles back to his native state, yet he and bea were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned. she probably was there, however. also, she wasn't his only wife - he was married once before he met her; that marriage isn't covered. in the movie, we're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. it would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film.<br /><br />what isn't skipped is his glorious music, which seems to go on constantly throughout the film, continually reinforcing his genius and artistry.<br /><br />charles' story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout. those who scoff at it as a made-for-tv movie don't give it the credit it deserves. taylor hackford's direction gives "ray" a good pace, and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully.<br /><br />as ray, jamie foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part. foxx wore prosthetics, did his own piano playing, and spent a great deal of time with charles preparing for the role. he nails him, but it's not an impersonation - he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word junkie and believing he's not hooked; and he's in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on. he demands to be paid in $1 bills so they can be counted; when he discovers he's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job.<br /><br />one doesn't so much marvel at foxx's performance as accept him as ray from the first time he appears on camera.<br /><br />this is an excellent biography, which, like "walk the line" is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist. whether or not you're a ray charles fan, "ray" is something to experience.
