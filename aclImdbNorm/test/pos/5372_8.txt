ben (a fine charles bateman), his young daughter k.t. (a cute geri reischl), and his new girlfriend nicky (the extremely attractive ahna capri) are on their way to a birthday party for k.t. they unexpectedly get waylaid in a remote southern town where no-one is able to leave, and with the exception of ben, k.t., and nicky, no-one can get in either. to top that off, children are disappearing and adults are being murdered at an alarming rate. ben helps some of the locals - sheriff pete (l.q. jones), tobey (alvy moore), and jack (charles robinson), the local priest, try to solve the mystery.<br /><br />this early 70's devil-themed horror movie actually predates "the exorcist", and combines a "bad day at black rock" type plot of a rural town with a great big skeleton in its closet with horror elements, for interesting results. it actually sent a few chills down my spine this viewing, as it inexorably moves along its ominous path. the moody and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and holds for the duration; the ever-growing sense of panic gives it a real kick. some memorable set pieces include the bizarre opening of a toy tank turning into a real one and squashing a car flat, not to mention nickys' twisted nightmare, vividly and stylishly realized by director bernard mceveety and crew. jaime mendoza-navas' music is subtly sinister and gives it that extra sense of eeriness.<br /><br />the steadfast and professional cast does some fine work, especially the ever engaging strother martin as the affable doc duncan, and producers / actors l.q. jones and alvy moore.<br /><br />just the fact that the whole plot is right under the noses of our heroes makes it that much more scary. jack the priest starts leading them in the right direction, but will they be in time to put a stop to things? it's an enjoyable little chiller worth re-visiting; just speaking for myself, i was able to appreciate it a lot more after giving it a second chance. i can say now that yes, it is indeed under-rated, telling a good story in an interesting, unconventional, and effective way.<br /><br />8/10
