in landscape after the battle, andrzej wajda in the second era of his filmmaking career, depicts emotional and psychological confusion in a former nazi-prison in poland, freed immediately after the wwii.<br /><br />a hand-held camera explores a lot of extreme close-ups and vivid colors. the end credit as graffiti on flanks of freight train cars symbolically concludes the film. the soundtrack is great, except vivaldi, which sounds tacky in pop-art fashion, in the opening sequence.
