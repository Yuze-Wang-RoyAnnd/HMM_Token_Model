robert florey and james wong howe gave this a frightening, expressionistic look. scenes are shot at weird angles -- especially scenes involving figurative and literal lady-killer zachary scott. his sociopathic behavior presages another superb, medium-budget movie, "the stepfather," by more than two decades.<br /><br />the entire cast is excellent, though (though no fault of her own) it's hard to think of joyce compton as anyone but the singer in "the awful truth.") scott, bennett, emerson, decamp (especially, and though playing an older woman looking gorgeous) -- they couldn't have been topped.<br /><br />setting a creepy lodger-in-the-house-of women story against a background of psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off beautifully. nothing corny at all.beautifully. nothing corny at all.<br /><br />the resolution is a little pat, unfortunately. not emerson's getting together with bennett. that makes sense. but scott is dispatched too quickly. i seem him more as a mr. ripley character, who could have escaped everything -- the botulism, the murder rap, the jealous sisters -- and disappeared into the great world beyond this story. that would not have impeded the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss finally getting together.
