written by someone who has been there, you can tell, but only if you've been there. excellent performances by meryl streep (of course!), renee zellweger and william hurt.<br /><br />many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family, i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment. to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! you are losing your family as you know it, can anything be worse? people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it. maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he'll never get a chance at again. maybe they will realize how hard it is to die, or to watch someone you love die. they didn't miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
