i have spent many years studying all the great directors, like kurosawa, lean, fulci, lenzi, deodato, peckinpah, kubrick and admire them greatly. my favourite film is once upon a time in america.<br /><br />i have only recently become a fan of d'amato, and while he was no horror master, his films were extreme whether it be soft core, hardcore or extreme.<br /><br />porno holocaust is now one of my favourite films, the way its shot is brilliant and the music is catchy.<br /><br />joe d'amato, wasn't a horror master, he's no fulci or bava, but however he was a master of erotica, no other director could shoot erotic films like him, he also never tried making any films outside of these genre's either.<br /><br />long live joe d'aamto-master of porn and erotica!
