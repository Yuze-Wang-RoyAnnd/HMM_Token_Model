my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold london evening in leicester square, after the movie, says: if they didn't speak english and they didn't show the stadium, you could have thought this was the slums of a south american city or some other slum anywhere in the world,not queens in nyc.<br /><br />ramin bahrani is , right now, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the other face of american, but the real face of america.<br /><br />ramin bahrani's movies are like ladri di biciclette, or germania anno zero, or roma citta' aperta. chop shop is reality turned into a movie, is more realistic than a documentary, in fact i think ramin bahrani's movies are more realistic than documentaries. this is a great movies, but don't expect any car chase or shooting. this movie is about tragic lives on the margin of the wealthiest , richest country in the world.
