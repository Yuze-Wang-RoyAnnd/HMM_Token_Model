i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable tv and i can't understand why. geena outdoes arnold as an action hero in this film! geena is an ex-cia assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. she continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. it seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. she hires samuel l. jackson, who is a former police officer. together they form a pair that is as entertaining as mel gibson & danny glover. when geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song "she's not there" playing in the background. what follows is geena and samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. all through the rest of the film geena has to decide who she really is. the killing unfeeling machine? the mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? or a combination of both? especially, since the bad guys grab geena's daughter. great action scenes that rank up with any of the die hard movies!
