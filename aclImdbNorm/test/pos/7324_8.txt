this belongs in their top tier, although there were others, such as micro-phonies and punch drunks, that were more deserving of oscar nominations than this one. but if nothing else, the recurring loudspeaker announcement, "dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard," followed by curly's "woo woo woo woo," makes this a classic on two levels. first, it symbolizes all that the stooges represent; my daughter loves to repeat the announcement when she is in the middle of doing something silly. second, the absurdity of these three as physicians in a hospital; i imagine the terror i would feel if i were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement over the loudspeaker. throughout this short, you hear that announcement and you know that something horrible is about to happen, and the loudspeaker voice stays with you for months afterward.
