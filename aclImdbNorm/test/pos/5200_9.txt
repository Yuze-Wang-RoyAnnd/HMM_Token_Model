bloody marvelous. recommended by a friend who knew i liked thomas kretschmann in the pianist and downfall. i loved the flow of the narrative - how the characters moved from hope and ideals of valour through shock, fear, disintegration, desperation and utter annihilation. a first rate anti-war movie that must have created quite the stir in germany. not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost. this movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in pounding the utter futility of trying to control untamed nature and the russian psyche. if i didn't know i would have thought it was a russian movie it was so fatalistic. what an uncompromising ending. a pieta.
