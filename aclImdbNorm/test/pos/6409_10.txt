this film is like a dirge. until it gets to musical numbers which are like mind f*ck, but gentler, like a mind caress. mind foreplay. the depressing vibe given from the speed & desperateness of the characters can be pretty kill-yourself-awesome until you get to the musical numbers. it's a great film. optimistic. weird. manic-depressive(bipolar). that's it! this movie is bipolar. anyway see it. it's a musical!!! with depth!!!! if you like the existential dross like the stranger, or waiting for godot, then your probably get a real kick out of this one. i had to get the dvd through amazon.com for like 12$. oh & the songs rock. well they rock but they aren't rock, there like calypso, jazz, broadway, but by grace chung, & i can't find the soundtrack nowhere< but i wanna the songs are great, & the dances are so fun.
