gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed . it is by far the movie of all movies . the romance between scarlett and rhett made people dream all over the world and turned the lead actors into cinematographic icons . one can ask , is it really necessary to make a sequel ? and ... there are some big shoes to fill .<br /><br />well , there was the book first . 'scarlett' by alexandra ripley is , we have to admit , well-written and fully respecting the world created by margaret mitchell . she picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently leads us from mitchell's heritage into her own fantasy . in the book scarlett , defeated after melanie's death and rhett's leaving , travels to charleston to reside with her mother-in-law in hope of regaining rhett's love . her typical manipulative behavior evokes once again a lot of criticism from rhett and drives them further apart ... until a certain boat trip that will change everything . scarlett now carries a secret . the series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of scarlett in ireland . from then of , book and series slowly split ways . the actual end differs , but of course the both have scarlett and rhett back together .<br /><br />the production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next scarlett o'hara . many countries made their own television shows featuring young actresses auditioning for the part . eventually , about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in atlanta , georgia . unfortunately , the producer found no scarlett amongst these actresses . sad for the girls , major publicity for the show ( it was already sold to many television stations worldwide before shooting even had started ). robert halmi , the producer who bought the rights to 'scarlett' , told he discovered the right actress while watching tv , gave her a call and two days later signed the deal . joanne whalley-kilmer ( who starred in'willow' and 'scandal' , the latest being the movie robert halmi was watching that faithful evening )is not vivien leigh , but she certainly is scarlett ! her performance is not a copy of leigh's , she makes the character her own . the major difference between gwtw and 'scarlett' is the fact the lead character evolves and grows as a person . this is the series prerogative , why copying something that has been done before ? considering there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and second storyline , it is natural that both authors emphasize on different aspects of the characters . whereas mitchell works around scarlett dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting for tara , ripley lets scarlett face her demons . this to me , is the most interesting aspect of the series , we get to know scarlett in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants . i totally agree with the choice of timothy dalton as rhett butler . he portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than clark gable's performance . the rest of the cast was well chosen . julie harris is endearing as rhett's mother , john gielgud gives a very amusing performance as grandfather robillard and sean bean is always at his best playing a dirty character , his lord fenton makes no exception . poor choices however with stephen collins as ashley and ann-margret's adaption of belle watling was a waste of money . costumes , sets and locations are elaborate and convincing . the newly built tara set looked exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house appears for the first time .<br /><br />is there a point in making a sequel ... well , six hours of romance are to me . one to watch !
