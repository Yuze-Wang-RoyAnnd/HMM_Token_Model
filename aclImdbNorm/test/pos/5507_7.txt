this off-beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews. my question is; why? i think this movie is pretty good. dee snider did very well for his first (and only) time directing. he also plays the antagonist, captain howdy (carelton hendriks). this movie seems to have a view of the future. although it came out back in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here. although taken to another level, this is an issue which we still face today. i'll admit, the story fell short a few times, but that doesn't make this a bad movie at all. robert englund is even in this movie, that automatically makes it better. the acting wasn't bad, the characters were pretty good as well. hendriks was a pretty good antagonist i think. i give this off-beat horror a 7/10. recommend for fans of saw.
