if you go into the twins effect looking for a pure hong kong movie experience you will be disappointed. this is not to say it is bad, but it is not a traditional hong kong action movie, running in a similar vein to shaolin soccer and kung fu hustle. it's resolutely silly and juvenile, so if you want a good bit of serious hong kong action, look to a john woo or yuen woo ping movie. this movie's got a lot of flak for it's silliness and i thought the first thing i should do would be to explain what you're getting into, as it's disappointed a lot of purists.<br /><br />for the non-purists and those with more forgiving tastes though, twins effect is a delightfully silly kung-fu comedy. i liked it a lot for a variety of reasons, not least it's wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act. i believe this is the first movie of it's type they've been in, but they hop, kick and fly about like seasoned pros.<br /><br />the patently ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention, and the movie is quite knowingly written, making a lot of the movie laugh out loud. the comedy really is the most prominent thing here, and it's a subtle, gentle comedy as reliant on words as inanimate objects going flying a la stephen chow. it has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too. the sequence with the disco-dancing vampires is a total classic.<br /><br />the action is a blend of two genres really. it falls between the 'period drama' wire-and-sword fighting (which comes in more toward the end) and the comedy fighting style of jackie chan, coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encounters.<br /><br />all this is great, and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through. despite this, it does have a few sticking points. for instance, twins effect is in many ways much more westernised than kung-fu fans are perhaps used to, the inevitable comparison to the blade series is definitely sound as an example, though twins effect is honestly much better than blade ever managed, especially for fighting action. personally, it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent anthony wong (the hissable villain from john woo's classic hard boiled) so underused, but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about hard boiled or his other movies, so this is only really a personal gripe.<br /><br />if you watch this with an open mind, you'll probably enjoy it greatly like i did, but you must be firmly aware it is a comedy, not a balls to the wall kung-fu movie. keep that in mind and you'll be fine.
