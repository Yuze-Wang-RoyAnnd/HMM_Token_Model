the film is excellent. one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynn's performance is superb. this is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al.<br /><br />i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn. the cold, calculating look on flynn's face as he does so is extraordinary - much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done.<br /><br />the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p. huntley jr as lt "queen's own" butler. it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor.
