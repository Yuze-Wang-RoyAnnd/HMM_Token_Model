onstage john osborne's adaptation of "picture of dorian gray" is a fine tribute to oscar wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.on screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passed.)the acting however is brilliant. sir john gielgud return's to his wilde roots as lord henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella. jeremy brett is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist basil hallward.peter firth,while not originally my vision of dorian, handles the role with style and grace...and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. the supporting cast is equally fine, gielgud's former 'importance of being earnest" co-star gwen francon-davies plays his philanthropic aunt agatha with dignity and judi bowker makes a touching sybil vane. the wit,pathos and tension of wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. my only other qualm is with the hair styles. many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of victorian hairdos rather than the actual style. overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence.
