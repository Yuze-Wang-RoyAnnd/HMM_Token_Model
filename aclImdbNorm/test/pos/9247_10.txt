all of the trials and tribulations of making a no budget movie right from the mouths of those involved. you feel all of the sweat, guts, determination and dedication stuie put into this labor of love and the frustration of being left hanging after all his work. the clips of interviews with all involved provides a great flowing narrative and conveys the balls-out, hardcore punk, almost anarchic attitude it took to film "waldo" and subsequently the documentary. stuie and company deserve all the props in the world for not giving up when the going got tough and getting "a texas tale of treason" out so we can see what it's like for the budding filmmaker on the street!
