it plays like your usual teenage-audience t&a movie, but the sentiment is incredibly bleak. if it was made today, it'd be considered an art house movie. it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid, but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying.<br /><br />the whole teen flick formula is adhered to, but nothing turns out the way you'd expect. imagine a director's cut of 'it's a wonderful life' where, at the end, james stewart wasn't allowed to return to the real world. an incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre. it makes you feel dirty afterwards: there is no redemption for the characters. i'm amazed it ever got made. the eighties version of detective story.
