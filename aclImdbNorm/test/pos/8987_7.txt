this movie starts off as a college t'n'a flick, but turns pretty ugly after the main character's sister is gang raped by a biker gang driving a van. it has a pretty good pace, and james van patten does a pretty good job in this cannon tax write-off movie. this was the first movie i ever saw at the parkway drive-in, here in toronto. the main feature was "alphabet city", and "young warriors was the added feature. out of the 2 movies, "young warriors" was by far more entertaining and memorable. if you are a fan of blow 'em up, excessively violent movies, this one would make a great addition to any collection.
