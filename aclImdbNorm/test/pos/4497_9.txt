i have not read the novel from which the film is based on. so i cannot comment on what is missing or if there were changes made.<br /><br />as i stated above, i had a wonderful experience watching the kite runner.. i find that when i see films about other cultures than ours here in the usa,i learn how other peoples live & exist.<br /><br />the actors in this movie are from afghanistan & other countries in that area. there are 3 young children in this near epic movie in there first roles, they were marvelous.<br /><br />the scenes that was supposedly in kabul were shot in various parts of china, i assume that the area is similar to the actual places in the book.<br /><br />mark foster directed & he did finding nevrrland, he has created the same magic here.<br /><br />all aspects of production are first rate.<br /><br />i found this a better movie than those nominated & won oscars.<br /><br />the film is sub-titled , it is very clear to read. it has a proper pg-13 rating. spoiler alert--- the child rape scene is very well handled.<br /><br />i cannot however give this a 4 star rating as the general plot & story line we have seen many, many times, non-the-less this is a very worthwhile movie to watch..<br /><br />ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) imdb 9 (out of 10)
