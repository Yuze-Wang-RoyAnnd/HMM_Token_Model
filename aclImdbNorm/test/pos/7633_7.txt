"l'ossessa" (released in english under many titles and the eeriest of them certainly is "the eerie midnight horror show") is one of the best italian rip-offs of "the exorcist". to really appreciate this film you should have a sense of humor. "l'ossessa" is at the same time sleazy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving.<br /><br />danila (stella carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she's going to restore. it's a wooden statue of christ, a demonic christ, maybe already overcome by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps planning dark deeds. the face shows infinite torment. the statue dates from the 15th century. danila is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor - the statue seems almost alive! she lives with her parents. her mother luisa (lucretia love) lives a dissolute life and doesn't care too much for keeping up appearances. her father mario (chris avram) observes everything with disenchanted eyes.<br /><br />the wooden statue will soon assume a human form (ivan rassimov) and possess danila in the carnal and spiritual sense. an amazing scene! the poor danila, from now on, will suffer the torments of hell.<br /><br />danila (the lovely stella carnacina) was ravished, violated, possessed by the devil and now following his orders, she will try to seduce others. ain't she emulating her sleazy mother luisa (lucretia love) who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bunch of roses? there is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving, when stella carnacina runs in despair through the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, remember?) of a small italian town screaming her heart out. luigi pistilli is a very good exorcist. his performance is, as usual, intense. the exorcism scenes (particularlly the final battle) are very, very amateurish, but this will only enhance the fun (and/or emotion?) if you've really got a sense of humor.<br /><br />stella carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and that's a factor that adds to your pleasure when she's naked, but i think that the film could have explored more her natural beauty. lucretia love is a very good sleaze companion (her nude scene with the roses... well.:) <br /><br />other italian exorcist rip-offs i would like to recommend for you are: <br /><br />malabimba (very sleazy and released uncut and digitally restored) <br /><br />"evil eye" (malocchio) - "the exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "evil eye", but others films, like, for instance, "rosemary's baby" should also be taken into account. "evil eye" is completely over the top. not that sleazy but with plenty of gorgeous italian and spanish actresses. you'll be drooling all over the film. the film is ridiculous, the story doesn't make any sense, but if you see it in the right mood you might feel moved! - a diabolical sect, possession, murders, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women all around. a wild ride! <br /><br />if you liked "evil eye", see also "ring of darkness" (un'ombra nell'ombra). this film can be found in the alternative market. search this title in the imdb. there are good reviews about it.<br /><br />p.s. - "l'ossessa" has many different faces. it's exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. it's cheap, cheesy... sleazy (but not that much) and it has an underlying "moral" message. this strange brew can sometimes be very funny. we all already know that "l'ossessa" is an "exorcist" rip-off so why can't we see it on its own terms? yes, mario gariazzo was trying to earn a fast buck, but he was able get the most out of a shoestring budget. the story is well told, the film is atmospheric and overall the actors are committed to their roles. see the film with an open mind and you may discover two or three new things.
