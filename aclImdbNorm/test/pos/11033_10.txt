this film is one of the best memories i have from childhood. having always loved tigers my mum took me to see it. <br /><br />it is absolutely amazing. its is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you. the image of tigers running through the snow with it all spraying around is still in my head some 25 yrs on, not many films have managed that, as other comments have said photography is stunning. a must see. i have also been looking for the film for some time with no luck at all. :-(. checking amazon every now and then reveals nothing, not even listed. if anyone does know of a source, please contact me or post here. tim
