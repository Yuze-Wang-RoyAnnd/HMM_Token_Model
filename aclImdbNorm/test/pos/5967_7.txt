i missed the beginning of the film. i came in when the partisan's were in the farm house. i can truthfully say that it was horrifying. the moral ramifications are staggering. <br /><br />my fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly. i see the christ like ability that was depicted by the brave patriot, and i can only pray that i could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his example.<br /><br />i see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness/strength of the tortured, but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with. all because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that, pain and suffering being brought to bear on a fellow human being is in some way satisfying. be it mental or physical. <br /><br />i found the film very thought provoking.
