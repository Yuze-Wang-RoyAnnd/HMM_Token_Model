ok, so it owes pulp fiction, but in my opinion has it's own voice and identity mainly because of the music-video direction style, sketch-like narrative and great performances. thomas jane delivers great (the drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary), aaron eckhart likewise. james legros has a short and effervescent appearance-great humor-"they got the wong house". the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable, as is mickey rourke's cameo appearance-"take a peak".<br /><br />great hollywood popcorn b-production with strong performances of a-level aspirants and renegades(rourke).<br /><br />well, take a peak, it's worth.
