some less than inspired opening string music notwithstanding, we somehow know that from the word go this is heading straight for the "big fun" drawer. by the time we observe monica dolan (in a truly genius bit of casting) delightfully goofing it up as cora early on we're already hooked, but it is only later on when she reveals herself in her marvellous screen creation, that deranged, scheming, maleficent queen of murder and deceit posing in the guise of the uptight miss gilchrist, that she not only effortlessly steals the entire telemovie for herself but quite simply blows off screen anyone who comes near her, including the ever well measured david suchet who himself seems to be somewhat bedazzled by her acting talents and, very gentlemanly, allows her to take centre stage. dolan is the true engine of the film and her miss gilchrist a genuinely well rounded character in this christie rendition, helped by a zesty script and the sprightly paced direction - and also by the rest of the cast led by geraldine james and dominic jephcott, who all display signs of sympathy for the given material and play with relish accordingly.<br /><br />the production values are spot on as usual, and if there are any weaker links they might be located in the comparatively substandard music score to the majority of later poirots, and also perhaps in the lacking of a genuine italian-born actor for the role of cora's husband. other than that, this is an hour and a half of pure televisual delight which is as self indulgent and entertaining as it is lovingly put together.
