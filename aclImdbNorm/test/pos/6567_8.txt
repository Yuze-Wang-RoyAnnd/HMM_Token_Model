i happen to have read all of junji ito's english released manga. i watched the tomie film and it was a big steaming pile of turd. thankfully uzumaki actually does justice to the manga. i think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this film more, as many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the film. this film reminds me of eerie indiana. the ending differs to the manga, which i was expecting. kirie looks like her manga counterpart, and her male friend suits the whole very well. very creepy i have to admit, this film feels like a feverish nightmare, the kind you have when you were a kid. not really scary at all, but freaky, if you get my drift? another great horror from japan, get yourself a copy.
