based on stephen hawking's "a brief history of time", this amazing film by eroll morris documents the the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. he has contributed more to science, despite his debilitating disease, als, than an able bodied scientist could only dream of.<br /><br />the film begins by telling of hawking's childhood, and how he was a poor student that was recognizably bright. he slacked his way through college and university, where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away normal functions of his body, but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly.<br /><br />morris discusses how the brilliant mind of stephen developed from childhood to the present, at one point his mother tells how- when she was pregnant- she prophetically bought a astronomical atlas to read while in the hospital. hawking himself narrates the timeline of his discoveries, while morris interviews close friends and colleagues whom have been lucky enough to befriend the magnificent man. <br /><br />he tells how he was first intrigued by the discovery that the universe was expanding similar to how a star would expand. we also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as "black holes", if this is the case,will the universe not too begin to contract, reversing itself until we reach the "big crunch"? as hawking puts it. and when the universe does begin to recede, will time not "reverse"? when posed this question, i began to think that death may not be the end, perhaps one day time will go backwards, and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death. the universe is one big cycle just like everything else in life. <br /><br />this is what hawking is telling us, everything in the universe recycles itself. this is completely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions pondering it. this is why i love this film and why isay it is a must see!!! an 11 out of 10 ...morris never ceases toamaze!
