i love this movie and i recommend it to anybody.damian chapa and jennifer tilly played their roles perfectly.just the characters alone pull you in to the movie.the directing was also magnificent.the most creative shots i've ever seen.i was stuck to the screen throughout the whole movie,not one scene was slow.the movie also has a lot of action packed scenes,cars blowing up,etc.the movie is just an all around masterpiece. if you like real entertaining movies then watch this because you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time.i put this movie on my top ten all time list,because there is never a dull moment in the movie,and that is my type of movie.2 thumbs up,all the way up!!!!!!!!!
