i watched this movie probably more than 20 times. the jokes are now 10-15 years old but every time i watch it it makes me fall off my chair. two of the finest actor salman khan and aamir khan plays the lead roles here. even if aamir khan is a much better actor and got the better role(smart guy) in the movie salman khan matches and sometimes perform even better as the dumb guy. all the characters are memorable. this movie is filled with hilarious one-liners and funny situations(a little too silly probably). don't try to look for logic in this movie. let your brain relax for some time. i promise it will be an experience to remember.
