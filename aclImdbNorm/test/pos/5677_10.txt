black water has to be one of the best australian movies i've seen in many years. my girlfriend and i sat gripping each others hands, jumping in all the right spots. this is as much a crocodile film as open water was a shark film. in other words, the creatures are merely part of the dilemma, the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances. how director's andrew traucki and david nerlich wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold. and when i say terror, its not overblown, artificially constructed squirm moments, but more little touches that when you ask yourself "how would i feel in that situation" lead you to conclude "scared witless". performances were great, the pacing and gorgeous cutaways to other life in the mangroves were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right. this is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud. go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film.
