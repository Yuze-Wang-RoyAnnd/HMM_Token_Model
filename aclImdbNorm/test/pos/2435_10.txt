this amusing, sometimes poignant look at the hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars robert sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, humphrey bogart, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name "sam marlowe". robert sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there. for awhile, "sam"'s only client is his landlady, who wants him to find her undersized boyfriend, and his only conversational foil is his secretary, simply called "dutchess" (misty rowe), who in his own words, "looked like marilyn monroe and made about as much sense as gracie allen", and has a passion for banana splits. then he encounters elsa (olivia hussey), the plain, sweet, virginal daughter of a retired props-master who has been murdered for no discernible reason. in the process of investigating the murder, sam shortly runs across: the gene tierney lookalike daughter (michelle phillips) of anastas, an avaricious, obscenely wealthy greek shipping tycoon (victor buono, turning in a creditable sidney greenstreet), his hapless, long-suffering second wife (yvonne decarlo, who manages to play a variety of put-upon emotions without saying a word), his two smarmy henchmen (herbert lom, channelling peter lorre, and jay robinson, doing a reasonably accurate lionel atwill), and anastas' vicious, amoral middle-eastern potentate (franco nero) who comes complete with a glamorus and bafflingly loyal mistress (sybil danning), all of whom would give anything to acquire the "eyes of alexander", two huge, perfectly matched star sapphires. when elsa is murdered, marlowe's interest in solving the case becomes personal, and he sets out through a labyrinth of los angeles landmarks, including the hollywood bowl, the scatological and esoteric attractions of hollywood boulevard, and santa catalina island in pursuit of the rocks, determined to get at them before either of the two wealthy competitors. throw in cameos by mike mazurki and assorted others, the traditional dumb-but-sympathetic ally on the police force, and a plethora of nicely drawn character turns that provide dimension to practically all players, and despite an unfortunate title song, you have, to my mind, a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.
