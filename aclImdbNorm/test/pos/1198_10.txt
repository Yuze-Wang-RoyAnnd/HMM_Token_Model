when i was younger i saw the end of hair on tv. i just watched the last 5 minutes of the film. and i was really impressed by it. i got goose pimples and i said to myself that i had to watch this film.<br /><br />and i did, and i've to say: this film is amazing. the songs are great, the actors are very good and the message... the message of this film is one of the most important ones: "make love, no war". this film is a real masterpiece. meanwhile it's my favourite film.<br /><br />the last song is one of the saddest and happiest i ever listened to. i nearly could feel myself joining the crowd. all i've got to say: "let the sun shine, let the sun shine in"
