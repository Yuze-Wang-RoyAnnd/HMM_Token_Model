this brings back so many childhood memories. (i'm not old, i'm 19) it's brill. the trains, the old house, the fallen runner, the really scary landslide (well it is when you're 6), the drama if the children can stop the train, or will it crash? this is a children's film without a doubt, but it offers great harmless no blood/guts/guns etc for children. and it's got bernard cribbins in it, who's cool. 8/10
