according to me, a movie can be best rated by the number of 'best scenes' there are. there are probably at least 80-90 scenes in the whole movie that is probably rated as 'best' by somebody or the other.<br /><br />this movie is a masterpiece. period. i know many who have called it ahead of its time, probably because it bombed at box-office. however, i think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through out.<br /><br />i am personally glad that mahmood is part of the movie too. his role isn't that 'meaty', however its good to see that he is a part of the cast in the funniest hindi movie ever.
