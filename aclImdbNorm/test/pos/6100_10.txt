spoiler alert i worked as an extra on this lifetime tv movie (filmed in seattle). it's really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie, because usually, they are still in the process of either still writing parts (as was the case here) or making editing cuts and major changes from the final parts.<br /><br />my husband and i both worked as extras in this movie, and i recall them discussing on the set how it was yet to be determined whether or not the little girl dies in the end. frankly, i never thought margaret colin's character really got adequate punishment for her crime of hit and run, lying to police, covering up, etc. could you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she had ended up killing the hit and run victim instead of her ending up coming out of her coma okay? just something to think about.<br /><br />by the way, i play a police detective you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often (we've counted four times). margaret colin was great to work with and very down to earth, although lisa vidal (now a lifetime regular) was aloof.<br /><br />overall, the movie turned out to be about a 7/10, but like another poster commented, is still a real tear-jerker and makes a great saturday afternoon cable flick.
