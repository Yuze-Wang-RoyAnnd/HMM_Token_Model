although films about edgar rice burroughs famous rousseauian hero tarzan have been seen by movie goers for almost a century now, this is the definitive version of the story. greystoke is the actual story of the origins of tarzan as set down by edgar rice burroughs way back in the second decade of the last century. i've been assured by experts.<br /><br />tarzan and sherlock holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history. i've no basis in fact for saying that, just a gut feeling. the most popular holmes was basil rathbone, the most popular tarzan was johnny weissmuller. and films that they made with both those characters will be criticized no end by purists.<br /><br />but greystoke is the real deal, a faithful adaption of burroughs first story concerning the origin of his hero. i can't think of another film which shows that tarzan learned french before english, but that is shown here and it's only natural since it was a french survivor of a massacred safari played by ian holm who discovers tarzan who has been raised by the apes since his parents who were shipwrecked on the african coast died there after his mother gave birth.<br /><br />his parents were in fact the son and daughter-in-law of the earl of greystoke and the surviving earl, played by ralph richardson is of course overjoyed to learn he has a grandson. of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society. <br /><br />one who doesn't is andie mcdowell playing of course jane. she does not communicate with tarzan in answer to his grunts and monosyllabic commands. tarzan speaks a concise english, french, and understands the language of the apes as well. as for the language of love, tarzan and jane need no lessons.<br /><br />greystoke earned three oscar nominations for best makeup in regard to the apes, best adapted screenplay and a posthumous nomination for ralph richardson for best supporting actor. it should also have rated a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scenes in cameroun and the scenes of the british aristocracy in several landmark places like hatfield house and blenheim palace.<br /><br />for burroughs purists, greystoke is the real deal.
