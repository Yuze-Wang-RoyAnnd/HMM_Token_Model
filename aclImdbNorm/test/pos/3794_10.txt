the very few reviews i could find online of barnens "o really do not do it justice. i read them all before ordering the dvd, but for some reason i ordered it anyway. i regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so i couldn't cancel it. i'm very glad now that i couldn't. it's an extraordinary movie.<br /><br />i won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. but i will say that i don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic. it is certainly very unusual, which i suppose could make it seem weird to some people, but the other criticisms must reflect the reviewers' own issues, because i didn't see any of that in the movie i just watched. i'm not attracted to boys, so the nudity didn't seem pornographic at all to me--it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life. and it's sweden, not utah, so topless women are no big deal.<br /><br />but what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this gutsy lost kid who goes on a sort of odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences, looking for--and ultimately finding--himself. it's fascinating, thoroughly original, and deeply satisfying.<br /><br />i'm not at all surprised that barnens "o won three major guldbagge awards, for best film, direction, and actor, but i'm absolutely astounded that the actor who won was not tomas fryk, the kid whose fearless performance as reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed, but ingvar hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of stig, reine's mother's sleazy boyfriend. i don't understand that at all, but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie.
