john wayne's first starring role just blew me away. televised letterbox style on amc, i had to check and make sure i had the right date. sure enough, this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide-screen process. aside from that, it features some of the grittiest, most realistic footage of the trek west i've seen. wagons, men and animals are really lowered down a cliff face by rope. trees are chopped by burly men -- and burly women -- so the train can move another 10 feet. the indians are not the "pretty boy" city slickers who portrayed them later; they're the real deal. a river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic, it has to be real (in fact, i understand that director raoul walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence). i could smell the wet canvas. each day is an agony. the various sub-plots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not. i can't think of another title that can beat the big trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to oregon. bravo.
