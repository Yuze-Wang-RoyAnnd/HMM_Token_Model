i watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed. although i like this film and was engrossed by the story, i did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat.<br /><br />the story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic policewoman. the location is a quaint korean village. <br /><br />this film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. however i was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman, yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life. in my mind he is a sweet, noble loser.<br /><br />good points - excellent acting by the two main leads, enjoyable snapshot of village life<br /><br />cons - flat ending<br /><br />overall - good but i prefer the before sunrise and after sunset films (or is it before sunset and after sunrise)
