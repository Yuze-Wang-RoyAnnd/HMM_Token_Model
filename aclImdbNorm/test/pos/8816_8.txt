feisty dianna jackson (a winningly spunky performance by gorgeous former "playboy" playmate jeanne bell) goes to hong kong to take out the evil heroin ring that murdered her brother. dianna's assisted by friendly karate master joe (amiable chiquito), faces opposition from undercover narcotics agent elaine (lovely, buxom blonde babe pat anderson), and romances cocky, ruthlessly ambitious charlie (essayed with supremely arrogant aplomb by stan shaw) while plotting her revenge against nefarious drug kingpin sid (an effectively slimy ken metcalfe). director cirio h. santiago, working from a blithely trashy script co-written by none other than dick miller (!), crams the lively and eventful 72 minute running time with a plethora of gratuitous distaff nudity and loads of badly staged martial arts fight scenes (bell is clearly doubled by a squat guy wearing a giant afro wig!). the definite sleazy highlight occurs when a topless bell singlehandedly beats up a bunch of thugs in her hotel room. felipe sacdalan's raw, grainy, scratched-up cinematography, the clumsy use of strenuous slow motion, the funky-groovin' score, the laughably inept fight choreography, and the surprisingly gruesome conclusion add immensely to the overall scuzzy fun of this deliciously cheesy grindhouse exploitation hoot.
