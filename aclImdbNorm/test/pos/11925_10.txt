quick summary of the book: boy, billy tepper, about 12 years old is school's main trouble maker, and if he gets kicked out of one more school he'll be sent off to boarding school. his upscale boy's school in switzerland (or somewhere like it) gets taken over by arab terrorists, why i'm not really sure. billy has no friends, and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database. he, with the help of two teachers thwarts the terrorists' plans, and save the entire school. the book wasn't bad, but was sooooooo clich'e.<br /><br />now about the movie; they switched arab terrorists to cuban terrorists, and make billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends. they like to get into trouble, but normal teenage stuff. this movie was believable. maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. you can watch billy, joey, and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting out the way they did (or at least wanting to).<br /><br />great action scenes. not everything goes as planned for either side. overthrowing the terrorists was messy, and good guys did get hurt. i won't say who, but it is heart wrenching (i know, i use that word a lot). sean astin is excellent. as a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend. this movie proved once again that he could play the leading man, kid, whatever. the only performance that may have upstaged his was wil wheaton's, who played the only son of a new jersey mafia man. he hated his father, and everything he stood for. (a far cry from wesley crusher) usually this genre of film is one i watch for the soul purpose of making fun; but not toy soldiers. the story line flows, the dialogue is usually believable. i can't think of a single moment where i found myself shouting at the tv "oh that would so not happen" great movie that should be in everyone's collection.
