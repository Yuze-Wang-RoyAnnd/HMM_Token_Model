as an english teacher, i appreciate films that do more than tell a story. good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. this film made me do all three. mr. jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. i also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films i have seen. the acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. excellent soundtrack, with songs you don't hear on the radio. it is a reconciling with life/spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance.
