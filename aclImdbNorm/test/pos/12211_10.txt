i would like if they brought back surface. i really enjoyed the show along with my family. i felt the plot development and storyline were first rate. like the other person said, it seems that everything gets reduced to the lowest common denominator. nothing but bland, politically correct junk survives. just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show. also it is not nice to leave us hanging as to what happened the all of the characters on the show. this is the same thing that happened to the time travel show i think was called 8 days but should have been called backstep. did the olympics kill surface? i know the writers strike killed another one of my favorite shows years ago called greatest american hero.
