it opens with your cliche overly long ship flying through space. all i could think at this point was "spaceballs" and hoping there'd be a sticker on back that said "we break for nobody." the movie then shows some cryogenic freezers with vin diesel's narration. i've always thought his voice sounded cool ever since i saw fast and the furious. from when i found out he was as criminal, i thought the movie was going to be cliche. it was. it was very cliche and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. black out every 22 years. lucky them, they land on that day. aliens can only be in the darkness, hey it's a solar eclipse. as much as i thought it was too easy and just a cliche, the movie pulled through and kicked major @ss. i even went out and bought a copy of pitch black after seeing it. i really can't wait for chronicles of riddick.
