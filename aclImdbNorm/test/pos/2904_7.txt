there are many film now on dvd, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. the egyptian, along with el cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. many people from my generation learn a lot about history of egypt, medieval spain and even the incas, (the first time i heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with charlton heston called the treasure of the incas), same happened to me with egypt, or rome seen many "bad" epics of the era. many production values, excellent use of color (the de luxe color was more brigit and sharp that the ordinary technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong but in any case, the film did man`eged to give us idea of the life in ancient egyptin and was in a way the motor to go out and buy the novel, my mika waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical-novel ever published. also oust anding was the superb score by alfred newman and bernard herrmann. i saw this film many times when i was a boy, it was not the big box office hit that fox studios wanted to afther the robe enormous hit, in cinemascope and stereo was a wonderful eye popping sp4ectacle. i have the lasser disc version.m the only way to see ito its wdisescreen format. soon i hope will appeared.
