the lament and almost unbearable melancholy of amalia rodriques' music goes to a place in the soul that only music can stir. in her voice and magical presence, lies the exquisite agony of the fado, an art form of which i was unaware until seeing this film.<br /><br />for me, the success of this beautifully and lovingly crafted documentary lies in the fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to editorialize and simply allows us to share in the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon. there seems to be an inevitable corrolation between the portuguese fado and american blues.<br /><br />documentary filmmaking at its best, transports us to a previously unknown reality. and having been allowed this glimpse, we are transformed.<br /><br />abrigado, sr.de almeida
