one true thing rises above its potentially schlocky material to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and flawed, real people. it opens with rene zeleweger discussing her mother's death with the district attorney; sparing us the cheap cinematic shots of a "shocking" illness and death. from there it proceeds into a look at a family system, in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /><br />william hurt as the self-important father, and meryl streep as the suzy homemaker mother are both superb; nuanced and not what they appear to be. zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself. tom everett scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well.<br /><br />the story is predictable, and takes at least one badly soppy turn it needn't have taken, but the performances, and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, make it worthwhile.
