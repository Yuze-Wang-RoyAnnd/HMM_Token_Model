the brainchild of comic strip pioneer alex raymond, "flash gordon" was the grand daddy of all sci-fi epics. this serial is the first time flash was brought to celluloid life. despite it's low budget, this is a great space opera.<br /><br />the story begins with earth doomed to apparent destruction, when the planet mongo comes hurtling through space on a collision course. maverick scientist dr. zarkov is headed off for the approaching planet in a self-made rocket ship, convinced he can do something to stop the runaway celestial body. he gets some last minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete flash gordon and beautiful dale arden. once they reach mongo, their problems really begin. they run afoul of dastardly emperor ming the merciless, conqueror of his world, who has some ambitious plans for earth.<br /><br />the rest of the serial revolves around flash's desperate attempts to save the earth; the assorted alien cultures he encounters; the allies he makes; space ships he flies; the battles he fights, and the monsters he slays.<br /><br />brilliantly conceived by raymond, "flash gordon" features classic archetypes from legendary myths and fables of antiquity. echos of famous tales, like the sagas of troy and camelot and sherwood forrest are seen here. you have the dashing, handsome hero, on a quest to save the kingdom (flash); the evil king (ming); the old wise man (zarkov); the lovely damsel in distress (dale); the seductive siren (aura); loyal allies (thun, barin, vultan); plus monsters, dragons and assorted beasties.<br /><br />flash is a modern robin hood, jason or beowulf. ming is prince john or aggamemnon. dale is helen of troy or gwenevere or maid marion. zarkov is merlin or odysseus. (or gandalf) thun/barin/vultan are the merry men or the knights of the round table.<br /><br />you get the idea.<br /><br />you can't help but notice how many ideas from "flash gordon" would later reappear in star wars. the cloud city; the ice world; the forest moon; the scrolling opening text (from the second serial); there are others, but you get the gist. the whole sci-fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic.<br /><br />buster crabb is the perfect action hero, and i personally think he's better at this sort of role than any of the current crop of action stars. he also played buck rogers and tarzan.<br /><br />charles middleton is the embodiment of diabolical nastiness as ming. sure, he seems a bit melodramatic today, but that was what audiences expected from their bad guys in the 30's. <br /><br />jean rogers is our hero's love interest dale arden, and i had such a crush on her when i first saw this as a boy. i can readily understand why flash always rushed to her rescue. she's the quintessential good girl, to counterpoint the seductive manipulations of aura, the quintessential bad girl.<br /><br />the supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to emulated their comic strip counterparts, and despite the now-silly looking fxs, there was a lot of thrilling action in this groundbreaking serial.<br /><br />an all around fun romp and the beginning of the sci-fi genre in cinema.
