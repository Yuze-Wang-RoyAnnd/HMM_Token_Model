surprisingly good made for t.v. thriller. i wasn't expecting too much from this one but i'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. it's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. <br /><br />the story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.<br /><br />the background story of thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.<br /><br />the "stranger" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society. a serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this movie displays the sickness and crime in a perfect way. <br /><br />my beef with the movie was the non sense situation when thiessen's character returns home with her deranged husband after he's released on bail. by that moment she knew what he did to his young relative (played by the cute allyson hannigan). but that's just the typical hollywood scene that provokes more trouble. <br /><br />the climax scene shows thiessen following her husband when he's about to commit another rape, then she calls the cops who come in time just to capture him. the ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for 99 years in prison in real life. <br /><br />the acting is also pretty good, and tiffany is great and gorgeous as always. the direction is also very good.
