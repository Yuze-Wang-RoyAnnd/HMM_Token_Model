i am continuously amazed at the us networks. what is the matter with them? yet another very very promising series axed after just 15 episodes and we are left not knowing what the hell happens to everyone. i really thoroughly enjoyed this show and am so annoyed that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the 'monsters' from the deep. this show had everything. humour, suspense, action. what more could you want. why oh why did the pull the plug on this? it just doesn't make sense. buffy went on for 7 series as did charmed and enjoyable as they were, surface, invasion and dead like me were even better. just because a show does not get terribly high ratings doesn't mean it's rubbish and if they gave it a bit longer probably more people would catch on to it and they would end up with a big hit on their hands. one season just does not give it enough time to catch on and the networks are far to eager to pull the plug. they should learn that like fine wines and cheeses, they take time to mature.<br /><br />bring surface and invasion back - p l e a s e !!!!!!!
