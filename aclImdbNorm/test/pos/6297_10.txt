you could tell from the opening shot of the conveyor belt in the bank that this was going to be a great film.<br /><br />a touch minimalist in feel with a twist of retro this film oozes style -the brilliant camera-work, acting, script and the manner that the secret life of the protagonist unfolds all complement each other in possibly making the best italian film i've ever seen (up there with la stanza del figlio - albeit different).<br /><br />shame on the people sitting behind me who made it obvious that they couldn't see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously crafted by the camera. don't miss.
