a film for mature, educated audiences...<br /><br />i saw "random hearts" in an advance screening shortly before its north american release. this romantic drama was quite a treat. i'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise. but the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.<br /><br />all-time box office draw harrison ford ("star wars," "raiders of the lost ark," "the fugitive," "air force one," "patriot games") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate internal affairs officer, dutch. ford's very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. this is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for harrison ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. next year harrison ford returns to action, first for director robert zemeckis ("forrest gump," "back to the future") in his summer 2000 thriller, "what lies beneath," and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of tom clancy's "the sum of all fears." 'fears' will be harrison ford's third outing as cia operative jack ryan.<br /><br />director sydney pollack ("out of africa," "the firm," "tootsie") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to scott-thomas' congresswoman. it's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for pollack. not only is sydney pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see "eyes wide shut" as well).<br /><br />kristin scott-thomas ("the english patient," "the horse whisperer") shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. this is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite ford's quiet-man toughness.<br /><br />the subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving ford's character's investigation into police corruption. look for a chilling & effective turn by "heat" actor, dennis haysbert, who plays detective george beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in dutch's investigation into police corruption.<br /><br />the rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. charles s. dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and bonnie hunt, who i find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as wendy judd.<br /><br />the technical side of pollack's thriller is top notched. from dave grusin's (pollack's "the firm") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to philippe rousselot ("a river runs through it") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film's unfortunate downer premise.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. this is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. it also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a harrison ford film in recent times. "random hearts" is definitely one of the better films of the year.<br /><br />(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)
