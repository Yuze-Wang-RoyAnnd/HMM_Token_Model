i had never heard of this movie, but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting, so i figured i'd give it a shot. i found it to be very enjoyable. heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown. i won't go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown. from their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. and lets not forget the beautiful rose byrne, who plays ledger's love interest. i would definitely recommend this movie.
