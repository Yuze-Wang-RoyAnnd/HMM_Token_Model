this movie is a great movie, however it is, as most movie highly predictable. the greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character amanda bynes, who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious. she is one of very few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the most strangest and gut-busting faces ever made. it's good for the kids, and contains upper male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. all in all, they did a good job updating an old classic, and deserves to rest on the movie stand along with o and 10 things i hate about you. the other actors also do a swell job, in many of their first time debuts.
