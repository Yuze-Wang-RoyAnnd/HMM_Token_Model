in nineteen eighty two when it was announced that the dismisal was going to be made , there was a storm of controversy. this was an event which still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the australian people. after some changes (listen out for the well timed telephones ringing to disguise names) the dismissal went to air. it was nothing short of brilliant. the leads were perfect. max phipps as gough whitlam lead the way, closely followed by john stanton as malcolm fraser and the evergreen john mellion as sir john kerr. the time was created well, the feelings of the people were well done and the political elements were not two dimensionally made into melodrama as in so many american series. the dismissal was a faithful re-creation of a time in australia which some would rather forget and which we cannot forget. it did not take sides and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. it leaves one wanting to maintain the rage and change the constitution which still allows for this to all happen again. the dismissal is now available on dvd in australia. watch it, learn from it and learn about our modern history.
