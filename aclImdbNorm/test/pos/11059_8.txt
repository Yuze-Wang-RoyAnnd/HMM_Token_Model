this short film certainly pulls no punches. the story is of a butcher who wrongfully kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually molested his retarded daughter. the film goes onto depict how the butcher serves his time, and returns to life with his daughter in care, and having to come to terms with a life with no future.<br /><br />the graphic opening scenes of a horse being slaughtered, and the full frontal birth of the butchers daughter puts you a brutal frame of mind that stays with you throughout the film.<br /><br />the snappy flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality. consequently alot of ground is covered in the 40 minutes. you are taken in fully with the butchers non-life - particularly after he loses his daughter to social services and his business. his story continues in the excellent film seul contre tous
