i managed to record the dion brothers, off broadcast tv, (with the commercials), back in the early 80s. i've loaned it to many friends, all of whom agree it's one of the best b "bandit" movies ever made. one day, while walking to my nyc apartment, i saw stacy keach shooting a scene for his tv series, mickey spilane. we had a moment to chat, and i told him how much i enjoyed the dion bros, and considered it a pure classic. he thanked me, and said it was one of the best, and most memorable film experiences of his career. he was very friendly, and sincere, and i was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan. this is one classic that needs to be on dvd.
