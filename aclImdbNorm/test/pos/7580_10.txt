i am not a movie maker but i know it is hard to tell a story and draw people into it in only seven short minutes. i think a good movie is one you don't want to end. eric did a great job of developing the charater of the microbe and making him seem "human". loved the music and the voice used for the microbe. i am looking forward to seeing what eric has in store for us in future films. this is one movie i didn't want to see end. great job.
