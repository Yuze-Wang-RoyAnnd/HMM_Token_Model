i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable, but i was so wrong! aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor! also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress! every one who i no who watched it loved it!<br /><br />the music in it was also really good!<br /><br />the my favourite lines from the film is "you cant send me to a public school mom! im a celebridee!!" and "take your time, it'l come to you!"<br /><br />although the endings kind of cheesy,all the good chick flicks do! this film is great, and a proper good chick flick, that i can watch over and over again!
