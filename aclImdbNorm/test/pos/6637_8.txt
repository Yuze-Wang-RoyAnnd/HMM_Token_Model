bergman's regular max von sydow and liv ullmann starred as a village couple, jan and eva rosenberg. the story began with an ordinary couple who fights and make up. jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who isolated himself from the world. eva is a practical woman who is getting fed up with her husband's lack of ambition. because jan procrastinating in fixing their radio, the are oblivious of the impending war. of course the war arrived, and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and to each other through the invasion as they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government.<br /><br />there were no musical score to the movie, but the soundtrack was the war noise. in one scene the pulsating background gun shot, the explosion, and sound of the fly by planes was incredible. now and then, bergman zoomed into the facial expression as different event took places. when something violent happened, he zoomed out to let the audience sensed the violence rather than seeing up close. very well done movie.
