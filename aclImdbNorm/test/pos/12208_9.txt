all i can say after watching the dvds of the first season is that i can not believe nbc "green-lighted" this show. it's so different than what's currently in vogue save for lost. those who miss the x-files just may have a worthy successor. not as mysterious or intense as lost, i find it to be overall more entertaining.<br /><br />this kind of extended story is hard to make. i mean it could degenerate into childish dribble if most of the elements do not cohere together. but cohere they do and i think the cast is excellent, the writing sharp, the location and props first rate, and the special effects very good for a television budget. sure it pushes what is plausible, but as it does it never gets so silly as to insult your intelligence.<br /><br />bottomline is that this is great sci-fi drama for the entire family. i doubt it will be a classic with a long run like x-files, but in the meantime i recommend getting the dvd if you missed it like i did the first time around. this fall my must see shows has just increased by one more series!<br /><br />ps: i just heard it got axed from nbc...here's hoping sci-fi picks it up.
