too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. cathy bates owns this movie, she's never been better. the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what they're doing without laying on gratuitous hamming, except where it's called for, as with julie andrews' bits or jonathan pryce's camp videos. if you're not open-minded you won't get it. (see mark adnum's bizarre review, which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham, her career and her brother's obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives.) taking that as a cue, i might as well spend time eulogizing amo gulinello's stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack noseworthy's shower scene. so, cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time. i loved it.
