anthony wong plays lok,a husband whose wife is seriously ill.poor lok-due to her illness he has been going without sex for a long time.that's why he is plagued by a series of sleazy nightmares featuring nurses and schoolgirls."erotic nightmare" is a fun cat iii flick loaded with sleaze and voyeurism.there is also a bit of gore as the first part of the film shows some nasty killings committed by wong character under the influence of the monk's mystical powers.the dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy,so i'm not complaining.of course those who expect gruesome cat iii horror in the tradition of "diary of a serial killer" or "red to kill" will be disappointed,but fans of sleazy exploitation cinema should give this one a look.7 out of 10.
