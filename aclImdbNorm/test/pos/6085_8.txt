anthony minghella's 'the english patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of hollywood. it is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. at the 1997 academy awards, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep since bernardo bertolucci's 'the last emperor' in 1988. based on canadian author michael ondaatje's 1992 booker prize-winning novel of the same name, 'the english patient' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of world war two.<br /><br />during the war, a man (ralph fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. with his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia, he is assumed to be an allied soldier, and is simply referred to as "the english patient." after the war, in the mine-ridden hills of italy, a kind nurse, hana (juliette binoche), who has apparently lost everybody close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. over time, she comes to learn more and more about her "english patient," who is actually revealed to be a hungarian geographer, count laszlo de alm'asy. rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. via numerous flashbacks, we learn of alm'asy's former exploits in the sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, katharine clifton (kristin scott thomas).<br /><br />it's certainly easy to see why 'the english patient' was so successful at the oscars. it is such a beautiful film, blending the quiet beauty of the italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. cinematographer john seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since david lean's magnificent 'lawrence of arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from alm'asy's plane. even in the film's more intimate moments, excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.<br /><br />a long-time favourite actor of mine, 'the english patient' might just contain ralph fiennes' finest performance, and, considering his history includes such films as 'schindler's list' and 'the constant gardener,' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. his count laszlo de alm'asy is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we slowly learn more about his past, his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. "ownership" is a major theme of the film. when asked by katherine what he hates most, alm'asy replies with "ownership. being owned. when you leave you should forget me." however, as the relationship progresses, and katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him, alm'asy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: "i want to touch you. i want the things which are mine, which belong to me."<br /><br />juliette binoche, who received an oscar for her performance here, is excellent as hana, the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. after some time of caring for alm'asy alone, she is joined by a dubious canadian thief, david caravaggio (willem dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that it was alm'asy who betrayed him to the germans. hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with kip (naveen andrews), an indian bomb-diffuser in the british army. however, due to her past history, hana is afraid that becoming involved with kip will doom him to death, particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.<br /><br />at 160 minutes in length, 'the english patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. the ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful, but also uplifting in its own way. whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. nevertheless, in every case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.
