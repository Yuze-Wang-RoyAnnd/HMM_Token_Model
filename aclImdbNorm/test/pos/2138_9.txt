by the time it opened, "heaven's gate" had become, to its detriment, more a cultural phenomenon than a motion picture. at a time when concern about excessive budgets and directorial arrogance were growing, it was a convenient target, as it was a far-over-budget work by the latest "auteur" to hit hollywood, who had not yet established the track record that would have given him the benefit of the doubt among critics and the industry alike. as someone pointed out at the time, no one was going to jump on warren beatty's even-more costly and dark "reds," because beatty was "one of us," while michael cimino had not achieved that status.<br /><br />but "heaven's gate" was also affected by a cultural change taking place at that time, the political move rightwards and toward a more unquestioning patriotism and enshrinement of the myth of the west (and the western). a few years earlier, cimino's demythologizing of the frontier might have seemed timely, fresh, and a necessary corrective. but by 1980, in the wake of the reagan revolution, it was thought of as nearly un-american.<br /><br />which is a shame, because the film, seen from the vantage point of several decades away, is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life was, in hobbes's words, "nasty, brutish, and short." kristofferson plays james averill, an upper-class easterner who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in wyoming, where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by the settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary death-squad hired by wealthy landowners, including averill's lifelong best friend. in a more innocent time, averill and his rag-tag "army" of poor farmers would emerge triumphant; but this is anything but a traditional western, and when the u.s. cavalry joins the fight here, it isn't on the side of the "good guys."<br /><br />much like "the deer hunter," cimino's previous film, "heaven's gate" spends a great deal of time building up the details of the lives of its principals, giving the film an at-times leisurely pace that nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion. with excellent acting, a fine musical score, and the visual texture that makes one believe one is actually seeing the "old west" through new eyes, "heaven's gate" is a film that rewards repeat viewings. i only wish that mgm would put out a new dvd, with an improved transfer and a commentary by cimino. nonetheless, the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see what critics in 1980, possibly blinded by the film's cultural subtexts, managed to miss...that "heaven's gate" is a great film.
