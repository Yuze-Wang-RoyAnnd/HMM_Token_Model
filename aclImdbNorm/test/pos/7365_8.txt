caught this flick as one of a five-for-$5 deal from a local video store, and it was a most pleasant surprise. it's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who've just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up. they tell each other these stories to kill time, and are occasionally startled by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an o. henry-esque ending that left me gleeful. a real discovery. blood (and plenty of it), breasts and beasts round it all out rather nicely...jacinda barrett is worth the price of admission alone. this one is a keeper--jim bob says check it out.<br /><br />oddly enough, "pumpkinhead" was one of our five choices too, and imdb recommends that for anyone who likes "campfire tales". i'll followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one. joyeux samhain!
