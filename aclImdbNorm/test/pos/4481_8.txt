i recently stumbled across a tv showing of "passion...." (having missed the opening scenes). ms currier in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de balzac tale to the screen. i am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture. it must have been arduous shooting so many scenes in the desert. and i cannot comprehend how her trainer coaxed such a fine "performance" from the leopard, simoon. (this adverture calls to mind another suspenseful adventure, "naked prey"). why isn't this film more well-known?. hope i can find it on video.
