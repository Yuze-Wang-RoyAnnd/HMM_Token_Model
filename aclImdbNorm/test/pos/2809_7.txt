the movie is good and i think tiffany amber is very beautiful. i liked the movie. can anyone tell me how i can get hold of the songs from this movie? even the soundtrack will do. if that's not possible, can i at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? i tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. i tried cd baby, not there either. i browsed through google to get some details but there weren't any. i would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question. i know that the songs belong to country music and is sung by a country artist. i just need the title names along with the singer. i would recommend this movie or rather the songs to any country loving person.
