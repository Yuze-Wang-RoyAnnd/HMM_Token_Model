neil labute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, in the company of men & your friends and neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. when betty (renee zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (aaron eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. morgan freeman and chris rock are the hit men who follow her.<br /><br />what betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, dr. david ravell (greg kinnear). only problem: dr. david isn't real, he's a soap opera character on the show `a reason to love' and he's really an egotistical actor named george mccord.<br /><br />to say any more regarding what develops would be too much, but nurse betty is certainly original. its hit men are, like the hired killers of pulp fiction, are violent yet philosophical, its take on soap operas terrific spoof material, and its acting is the best feature of all. this has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. renee zellwegger is perfect for nurse betty, with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest. morgan freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career, and chris rock is his partner, a man of rage and great impatience. greg kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor/soap opera doctor. there are also great supporting performances from actors such as emmy-winner allison janney (the west wing), harriet sansom harris (frasier's agent bebe glazer), and kathleen wilhoite (chloe on er). actually, the supporting cast is a who's who of television best character actors.<br /><br />a unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next, nurse betty is a mix of great acting, casting, and a terrific screenplay.
