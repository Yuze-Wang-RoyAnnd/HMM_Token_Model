although it has been off the air for 6 years now, promised land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation. good cast, supporting cast(among them, richard thomas and ossie davis) and crew. the plot is believable with mcraney packing up his family and just saying "to hell with it all" after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier. i think a lot of vietnam-era veterans, myself included, could really relate to mcraney's thought process in finally deciding on his course of action. many of us did precisely the same thing in real life, after returning from that war and finding that america was not the same place we left. the show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life. in those two respects alone, i think it is one of the more poignant tv series of our time. why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me.
