this extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the zeitgeist of america today...which makes it all the more scary and relevant. "subversives" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest. as an alternative to life in prison, these convicted "criminals" are offered three days in "punishment park". their objective inside the park is to make their way to the american flag where freedom awaits them. not surprisingly, the punishment park option is a dirty lie. this brilliant film from peter watkins even pre-dates "battle royale" and "series 7", though its angle of attack is more blatantly political. shot in '71, it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today. the performances are exemplary and the direction is razer sharp. the narrative cuts back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the mccarthy-like trials that convicted them. today, this film still retains its power. in '71, there was nothing but nothing quite like it. this is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels. it has the balls that most people today have lost.
