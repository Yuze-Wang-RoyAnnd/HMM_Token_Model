beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen. not for its cult appeal, gore, or even for its ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni, one of italy's most famous directors. however, if you gave this film only a quick watch-over, passively i mean, it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. this movie deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. by cheese i don't mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar! the music seems like it's from some italian porno, the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head.<br /><br />but once you get passed all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. the basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate to each other. instead they can only communicate through each other. i suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy, because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic.<br /><br />i left that film thinking to myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. i hate, because i have reason. but what does the hated think? maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary. in other words, melodramatic.<br /><br />so melodrama is actually an existential function. a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do.<br /><br />this is a great film, i recommend it to all!
