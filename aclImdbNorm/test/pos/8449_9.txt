great film from the late 1970's. says much about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person, so that the powerful can gain gain huge profits and disregard the environment and safety of others.<br /><br />nearly 30 years later this film is compelling about the power of certain corporate entities that since the films release have gained ten fold in their ability to control; it shows the need for regulation of the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit.<br /><br />jack lemmon is brilliant- while jane fonda and micheal douglas are as equally compelling in their roles. the frivolous 70s where damned for much, this film redeems the decade.<br /><br />a film that becomes better after each watching.
