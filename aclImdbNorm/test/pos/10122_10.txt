as one who frequently goes to the movies, i have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies i have seen this year. ed harris and cuba gooding jr. gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters. it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. i wish hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre.
