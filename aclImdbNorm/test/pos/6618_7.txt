this documentary traces the origins and life of the zephyr skateboard team, using original film shot in the 1970s (mostly by craig stecyk) combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today.<br /><br />the first part of the film documents how the "dogtown" section of venice, ca came to be, starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a venice, italy-like european city. by the 1970's, the one remaining local attraction, the pacific ocean park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards. the poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. <br /><br />i found that the film covered much more about surfing than i expected, which seemed like a bonus since i really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before i watched the film. the soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. i also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience. the parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team's somewhat overinflated sense of self-importance (although this is probably just left-over street attitude from where they grew up). this is not to say that they didn't have significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. <br /><br />one note: my wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as "spasticam" (wiggling camera movements). this film is often guilty, so if you are so afflicted, be warned. <br /><br />i would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and/or surfing in their history.<br /><br />seen on 5/11/2002.
