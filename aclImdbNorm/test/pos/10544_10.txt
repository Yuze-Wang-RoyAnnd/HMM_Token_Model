at first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love, but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have.the first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave.but while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then.one year went by until i saw this movie in a not-free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too.i saw it once,twice...until 200 times and not kidding.i did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored.and i have to say that i'm not used to see a movie more than twice.the act is very good.gerard depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.i would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it.on balance,it's a movie i can't take out of my mind.
