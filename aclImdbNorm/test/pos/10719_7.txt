i have seen this film on 3 different occasions.on the first occasion,i was bowled over by this film.it appeared as a very kind film to me.i hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing.however my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good film.there is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between mr kramer and madam kramer.there are some scenes in which meryl streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life.dustin hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his child's custody.there was even a controversy on the sets of this film.according to the master cameraman nestor almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of mr.kramer,in order to show the intensity of his anger,decides to break a glass hard.luckily nothing happened to nestor.kramer versus kramer shows the destruction of a family structure.it also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved.
