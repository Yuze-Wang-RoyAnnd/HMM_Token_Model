"the king of queens" could be divided into two eras.<br /><br />the first era, constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck.<br /><br />the second era, increased the scope of the show, addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin.<br /><br />but besides all of that...<br /><br />this show was freaking hilarious.<br /><br />kevin james, when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with leah remini was unparalleled on tv.<br /><br />jerry stiller as the psychotic live-in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor, and patton oswalt as the "man-child" spence ulchin was amazing, (he's a great comedian too) "the king of queens" was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air, and it's a damn shame. now, all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance. i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning
