to this day, there isn't a movie i've seen more times than the chipmunk adventure, nor has any movie brought me more happiness. this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film, but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest, funniest, most exciting film ever! i'm still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers, each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80's pop (think pat benetar on helium, only catchier). <br /><br />controversy has stirred over the blatantly suggestive tone of the chipette's song "gettin' lucky with you", which to me seemed much more innocent at the time. however, looking at it as a rational adult, i can totally understand the concern; you've got three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming "getting lucky is what it's all about". the chipettes' were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie.<br /><br />but this controversial issue doesn't even come close to overshadowing the chipmunks' otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure, i encourage parents and childless adults alike to check out this movie. especially if you were a child of the eighties/early nineties like me. :-)
