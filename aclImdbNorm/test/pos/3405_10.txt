i was 13 when this mini-series (and its sequel north and south, book ii) first aired. i had already been captivated by the personal interest stories in/around our american civil war, which is what interested me in watching this made-for-tv program.<br /><br />i loved it. and now i'm 29 years old and i only love it more. it is full of history, beautiful costuming, real-life characters woven in and out of the lives of fictional characters, all of whom you come to care deeply about. there is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and reconstruction.<br /><br />even though i had the full set of episodes on tapes i recorded back when it originally aired, i purchased the full set of both n&s and n&s ii from columbia house some years ago when they became available. once every few years i'll take a whole weekend and watch all the installments back to back - and am sad when the last episode rolls to an end, because i find myself wanting to continue watching the story of the lives of these characters.<br /><br />i cannot recommend this mini-series more highly.
