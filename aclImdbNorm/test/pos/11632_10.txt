barney is about "imagination" what you guys do not have if my preschooler never wanted to play pretend like they do in that show then i would be worried. what 2 or 3 year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing. for those of you saying that all they do on barney is eat junk food and recommend sesame street better well what about "cookie monster" thats all he eats but i haven't seen anyone comment that one. i do agree that sesame is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun don't be too serious if you didn't like your child watching tv and worried about them understanding things you don't believe then you shouldn't be propping them down in front of the tv in the first place because all of that is fake everything is fake actors are fake so why don't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake television show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourselves and teach them what you want them to learn not big bird or bert & ernie or barney someone who used to watch all those shows and turned out fine.
