i loved this movie! it was adorably touching and funny. finally, here's a story about a group of people who meet some challenges, flounder a bit, and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for; when was the last time you saw that in a film? dealing with the fluidity of life, love, and sexuality, the characters are faced with real problems (albeit in often ridiculous situations like the men's group camping trip, and the explicit realatory liaisons) and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy, darkly desperate, or too unrealistic. you'll love and care about the characters who, far from being hollow stereotypes, portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their would-be labels.<br /><br />a good romcom for a saturday afternoon, and the only movie i've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily, and no one is forced to be anything they don't want to be. far better than kissing jessica stein, a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson. or, maybe you just like a good british romp? james purefoy looks dashing as always, and tom hollander is deliciously funny. so go forth, watch, enjoy; you won't regret it!
