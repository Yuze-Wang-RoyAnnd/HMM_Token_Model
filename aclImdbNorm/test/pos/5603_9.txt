while the camerawork was certainly "funky" - perhaps one dutch-roll short of "stoned" - the premise of the film was fantastic. it really took a scathingly satirical (in the true traditional of hal hartley) look at god, jesus and devil. the interaction of jesus and satan provides some hilarious scenes... even the monologues of jesus were great - this was by far the best jesus i've even seen. so laidback, zen-like, son-of-god-ish but still such a nice guy. on one level this is a very general look on the paradoxes of christianity, but yet there is still a personal level, where you can relate to jesus christ without having a god-complex (thanx to martin donovan and hal hartley).
