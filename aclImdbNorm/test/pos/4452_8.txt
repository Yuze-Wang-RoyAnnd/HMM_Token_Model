i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.<br /><br />this film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (the beyond, zombie 2, city of the living dead, house by the cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of italy. the scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood-soaked terror shrouded by crumbling ruins. the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to fulci's later films however, splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few close-ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film.<br /><br />overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors.
