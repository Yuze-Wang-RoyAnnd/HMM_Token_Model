"mr. bug goes to town" was the last major achievement the fleischer studios produced. the quality of the superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film.<br /><br />the music and lyrics by frank loesser and hoagy carmichael (with assistance by flieshcer veteran sammy timberg are quite good, but not as much as the scoring of the picture by leigh harline who also scored snow white for disney. harline's "atmospheric music" is superb, and a treat for the ears.<br /><br />the layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time, and once again the fleischer's background artists outdid themselves. the techincolored beauty of the film cannot be denied, and while hoppity the grasshopper is the star, the characters of swat the fly and smack the mosquito steal the picture. swat's voicing by jack mercer (of popeye fame) is priceless. kenny gardner (brother-in-law) of guy lombardo...and a featured vocalist in his band...does his usual pleasant job in the role of dick dickinsen.<br /><br />the movie has been criticized for all the wrong reasons. the fleischer studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product. the movie is tuneful, the story great for all ages, and the final scenes of the bugs scrambling for their lives upon a rising skyscraper is some of the best staging and animation of any animated film past and present.<br /><br />do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film. also don't fail to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of max fleischer's remarkable 3-d sterioptical process which took four months to construct and employed 16,000 tiny panes of glass in the "electrified" buildings of manhattan.<br /><br />do not miss mr. bug goes to town...aka hoppity goes to town. i'll wager you'll be bug eyed at the results!
