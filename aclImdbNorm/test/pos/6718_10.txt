danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. that honour belongs to lifeforce, which is, of course, the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halley's comet running amok in london end-of-the-world movie ever made. tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. plus it offers space vampire mathilda may, the best thing to come out of france since simone simon, spending the entire movie naked. which she does very, very well. just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered, she's also "totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous." it's a pitch meeting i'd have loved to have sat in on: astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150-mile long artichoke/umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halley's comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity, whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue ("i've been in space for six months, and she looks perfect to me." "assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter." "don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex."). oh, and we'll get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil, the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster. sounds like a winner, here's $22m
