my wife and kids was and still is the best comedy series on tv ever made.i really enjoyed it and everyone in the u.k still watch the recaps.the wayans bros. should all somehow be featuring together in a comedy show.my wife and kids was a comedy the whole family could watch and you don't get that very often.isn't there anything we can do to make it happen again??we would do anything to have that comedy show on again!1 damon wayans should make a come back! i would really like damon wayans to star or make another comedy like this one of course with the help of the whole wayans family.i was really sad when it ended that way and i hope they will be more to come in the future.brilliant comedy,excellent stuff! yours truly, dezmo
