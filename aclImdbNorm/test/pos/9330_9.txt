before this was shown on mtv or vh1 it was at my local theatre playing just before the main movie. i remember this short movie more than the film i saw that day. it was the first time i had ever a music movie like this, but i will tell you that seeing on the big screen from a 35mm print in a darken theatre gives it a much better impact than seeing a cropped pan and scan version on vh1 at halloween.
