first off, this film has no story. it's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.<br /><br />that said, the film is kinda brilliant. pfeiffer is amazing -- and i mean amazing, as catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. walken is walken -- but even more nasty than usual. devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to penguin, but he is good and memorable. <br /><br />keaton is underrated as batman. <br /><br />and the music and style are pure cinema thrill. true, the 3rd act doesn't work. but the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear pfeiffer and keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. that's too bad, because pfieffer and keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy batman for an entire generation of movie fans.
