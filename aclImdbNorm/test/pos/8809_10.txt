if you "been there" and "done that" you will absolutely love this film. i have and by "there" i mean underground clubs and house parties where there is far more rare to find people just being drunk than it is to find people high to their ears on extacy, speed or lsd. <br /><br />by "that" i mean dancing and sweating like crazy for eight hours or so in a row with out even a brake and , that followed by a way to long morning of no-can-sleep and almost wanting to die, followed by a week of just waiting till the next weekend to do it all again.<br /><br />so even though this film now is one of my absolute favourites i can certainly understand why some people, or most people even, would dislike it.
