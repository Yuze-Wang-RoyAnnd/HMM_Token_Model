<br /><br />average adventure movie that took a serious story and "holywoodised" it.the watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movie's place as a would be solid classic. why water down such a great storyline?probably because it deals with "sensitive" colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heat,just quick profits thank you.the directing,cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good.the screenplay was average.the charm of connery made up for his wrong arabic accent and all the scenes with president t. roosevelt were masterpiece takes.the costumes/sets here was very good.too bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demands.only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance/adventure holywood movies.....
