this film is an eery, but interesting film. i will tell you why it is eery later in this review.<br /><br />the film is interesting because it was the first film to ever contain sound. no, it may not be a one hour and forty two minute film, no it may not contain great action scenes, but it is still a wonderful film to me. it sparked a whole knew revolution if you will, of sound movies. this can be a little eery to watch, knowing that everyone in that film are now dead, i can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer walks the earth visible, and that the sound is cracky and broken.<br /><br />i recommend this video for everyone to watch. this created movies as we know it today!
