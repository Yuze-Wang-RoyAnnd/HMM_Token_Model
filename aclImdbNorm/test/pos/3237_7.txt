i've just watched this again on the bbc channel 4. it's not jane austen's best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation. i suspect the assembly rooms at bath would have been rather more crowded than shown; perhaps they couldn't afford the extras. also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation? i've never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when i've been dancing and i suspect it would have been the same in the 18/19th century in bath.<br /><br />i cannot believe the us/canada reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout. the "gothic" scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly. i'm sure jane a would be mildly amused by those reviews. a propos of nothing, does anyone else think that peter firth gets to look more like colin baker (a former doctor who) or vice-versa the older they both get?
