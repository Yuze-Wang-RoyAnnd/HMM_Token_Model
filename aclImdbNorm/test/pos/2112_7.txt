i have watched grand champion all the way through at least twice now. i enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. it is refreshing to see a g rated movie. this is a feel good movie. the story is mostly from the view of the children. the interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting. i recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film. if you liked the little rascals, you will probably enjoy this. i viewed this movie on cable. either on encore or showtime family. this is not a movie that i would have gone to see at the theatre. but, i only go to the theatre for the effects of the big screen, so most comedies, romantic films, or dramas i do not go for big screen-i wait for tv/cable edition. get your kids together, pop some popcorn and enjoy!
