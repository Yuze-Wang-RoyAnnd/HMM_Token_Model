i watched pp the other night. i have to say i was very impressed with how real the film seemed. it felt very much like a documentary. i also think that the film presented realistic possibilities. in the film the war in vietnam escalates to the point where china has become involved. what if that had happened? i think the scenarios would be similar to the one portrayed in the movie. we have had camps before in this country... and still do...<br /><br />highly recommended for everyone...especially radicals...<br /><br />i kept saying that if i were in the position that those kids were in that i would just lie my ass off. i love america and its grand wars (wink wink)
