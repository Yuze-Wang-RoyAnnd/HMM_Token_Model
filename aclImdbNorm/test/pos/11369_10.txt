this series has recently been unearthed and excerpts can be seen, at least within britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely. the problem is that this series was followed by the series the wars of the roses that had a similarly stellar cast and which has been available to cable tv, or at least crowding the market. <br /><br />the two series are quite different in dramaturgy; the wars consolidates the plays through extensive rewriting and shifting of scenes; an age of kings follows shakespeare more closely. both series benefit from integral casting.
