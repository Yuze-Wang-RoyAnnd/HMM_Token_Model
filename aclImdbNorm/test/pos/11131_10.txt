i truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes, but this one is completely different - it's simply brilliant. plot perhaps isn't any challenge for the viewers, but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great.<br /><br />i've seen it at least dozen times and still i'm not tired with the plot, characters or music (i just love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack that i've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that i owe).<br /><br />for me it's a must-seen kind of movie, great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end.
