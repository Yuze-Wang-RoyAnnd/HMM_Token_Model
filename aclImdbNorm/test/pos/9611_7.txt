crimson begins with some cool jazzy music so i liked it immediately, but as the film wore on i began to wonder if the music wasn't the best part. we have some thieves pulling a jewel heist and when one does something wrong the alarm is triggered and the cops chase them and when the car turns around at a road block one of the thieves (paul nash, jacinto molina, whoever he is here) gets shot. now, it seems like he might die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad-scientist friend (and wife) he is saved, with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called "the sadist". the sadist is unfortunate in that the gentlemen that kidnapped him lost their knife to remove is head, so to add insult to injury (or, in this case, death), they remove his head using a train, leaving the body for the authorities to find, oops. once the brain transplant is complete naschy wants to ravage any woman that comes near him, because he now has the mindset of his donor. well, of course this is all pretty improbable and features medical equipment that looks to have been purchased at radio shack, and overall it's pretty cheesy and sleazy. but, it has a good early 70's look and feel to it and the music is cool. this isn't so much a horror movie but more a thriller with lots of thugs battling it out over turf and babes and other thug-type things, but it's strangely entertaining in ways i can't begin to describe. 7 out of 10.
