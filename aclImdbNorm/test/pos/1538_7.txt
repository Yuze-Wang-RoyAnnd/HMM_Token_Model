acting, of course! think about it, closet land could easily have turned out so horribly - an entire movie filmed in one room with only two people, they better have some damned interesting things to chat about.<br /><br />but it didn't turn out horribly. on the contrary, thanks to incredible portrayals by both stowe and rickman, closet land is a masterpiece in its own right.<br /><br />that's not to say it is for everyone. persons who have had their attention spans decreased through glitzy sex scenes and random gun fire may have trouble digesting closet land. however, those who can appreciate good story telling without explosions should give it a look (no matter how many video stores you have to call to find someone who has it in stock).
