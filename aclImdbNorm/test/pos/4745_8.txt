a compact crime drama with a good amount of action. the unique nyc location shots adds to this tough little film.technically well done with good direction and acting. needless to say,the wild car chase that seems to begin in downtown, extends through the upper west side, washington heights, across the george washington bridge and into nj has to be one of the best ever on film.all around a fine flick that for me gets better with time.8 out of 10...easy
