jay craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film. first off, the photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all of the gloomy beauty of northern new england in late autumn (cinematographer paul ryan did 2nd unit on malick's days of heaven). second, the performances are uniformly excellent - rip torn's noel lourdes is irascibly charming and tantoo cardinal's bangor is at once sensitive and exuberant, to say nothing of a fine supporting cast. overall though, it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion, natural and genuine, that nevertheless does not seem expected. this is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between humans and history.
