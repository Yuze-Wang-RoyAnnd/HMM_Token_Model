i just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. i liked (not loved) "mork & mindy" as a kid, mostly for robin william's zany energetic performance. this movie made me remember why. was the original show great? not really, but robin certainly was. which brings me to this movie.<br /><br />i was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). but, of course, the real focus was on robin. it was interesting to see robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr. williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (on an unrelated note, i noticed that robin's struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that's the "taxi" behind the scenes biopic.)<br /><br />all in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan. the acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like i suspected- and the story moved along well. performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi (the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot!). not a great masterpiece by any means (i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those robin williams and "mork & mindy" fans out there. nanoo, nanoo!
