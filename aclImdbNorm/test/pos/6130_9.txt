"pink flamingos" is a cult classic.the plot of this film revolves around the throwdown challenge to divine's supremacy as the filthiest person alive."pink flamingos" contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eats fresh dog feces.yes,the movie is shocking and funny at the same time,but the biggest laughs come from the actors' lines.check out especially this line from divine:"kill everyone now!condone first degree murder!advocate cannibalism!eat s***!filth is my politics!filth is my life!".on the whole,i really enjoyed this film.still its tagline "an exercise in bad taste" should be taken to heart and even those used to the gross out movies today may find this gem hard to stomach.highly recommended.
