this is one of peter sellers' best movies. why is it never shown on tv or movie theaters? will it ever be released as a home movie? is it too derogatory for the medical field? i would love to see this movie again. i would like my son, who is a doctor,to see it. laughter is the best medicine and peter sellers is the best doctor for this.
