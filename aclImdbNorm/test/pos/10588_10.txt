the movie was fantastic. if your a fan of bams' cky videos, jackass, or his show viva la bam, you cant help but like it. i have a few friends who aren't fans that enjoyed it, and others who thought it wasn't that great. those who didn't like it were mostly female friends, they really didn't appreciate some of the crude humor, that personally i think made the movie so funny. i'm pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in bams home town, which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations. the cast of is made up of all his friends and cky buddies, and also includes some big name pro skateboarders too. the soundtrack is phenomenal, with music by him. in my opinion, haggard has it all. a great plot, characters you'll never see anywhere else. plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project.
