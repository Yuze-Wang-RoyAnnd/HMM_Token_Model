i must confess, i was surprised at how good this movie was when i first watched it. i had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out unpleasantly that it had already been and gone. therefore, i expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad. then, today, i rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it. the speed that events were occurring was questionable, it could have been a little longer. i found it was very true to the book, however it left out some crucial parts: mullet finger's real name, etc. i felt as if i hadn't read the book i wouldn't have really understand what was going on. the acting was quite good, another thing i had expected to be poor, however the cop, sorry i can't remember the actor's name, could have done a little better. all in all, i found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences!
