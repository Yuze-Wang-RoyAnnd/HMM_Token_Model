just saw it at as closing film of austin film festival. going in, a had seen a few snippets of their act at alamo drafthouse, and thought the trailer was amusing but i wasn't expecting such an epic theme music and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. watch out for cameos from ben stiller and tim robbins, and the dark lord himself (who has a fetish for kg). so much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. the car chase was by far my favorite scene. i know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new tenacious d fans, just like me. i hope this does well in the theaters.
