as someone who usually despises ali g, ali g indahouse was absolutely brilliant. when i was watching it, i was in a hysterical fit. yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and i loved it. as some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. i have never seen a comedy as original as ali g indahouse.for a comedy starring ali g, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. absolutely brilliant.
