got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. not that this ever bothered me anyway, since i love low budget sci-fi like dr who, blake's 7 and dark star. hell, even outland wasn't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.<br /><br />the story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. they then discover the prisoner has made it too, he's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems.<br /><br />the effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. films like i, robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of hollywood's offerings.<br /><br />whilst none of the actors get oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn't outstay its welcome. the characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they didn't in predator either, which it resembles in feel. big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn.<br /><br />some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end, but i like it. unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and i'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further.<br /><br />a cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. if this is what they can do on a shoestring i'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.<br /><br />recommended.
