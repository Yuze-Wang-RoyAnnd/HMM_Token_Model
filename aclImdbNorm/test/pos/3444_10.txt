seeing this film, or rather set of films, in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience. this monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical setting, reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is. the people are portrayed as they are to themselves: their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception. edgar reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings.<br /><br />when these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work, one cannot help but apprehend the force and vivacity of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that each person feels. when i saw these films i perceived my future experiences, how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental events. i acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives, memories and contexts. a masterpiece and a revelation. i only wish the bbc would screen it again.<br /><br />if anyone knows where i can get a copy, could they contact me
