there are no flaws in this production. perfectly entertaining, fun, and worthy of respect.<br /><br />this is what theatre is all about. definitely not for the very young, but slightly older kids will get a great kick out of seeing it and can be introduced to theatre this way.<br /><br />astounding and amazing.
