i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in egyptology). i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.<br /><br />the film only approximates mika walteri's "the egyptian", in plot. a good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.<br /><br />the music score by b. hermann and alfred newman is beautiful!!! performances as follows. the late edmond purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years. he states that he keeps to himself,has the best education available and lets' face it is a rather emotionally distant person, given his upbringing and high intellect.<br /><br />jean simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid; honest loving and sincere. bella darvi, people complained about her accent, well she is a babylonian. it is not that apparent in the film as to why sinhue is so insanely obsessed with nefer nefer nefer. her correct name. in the book sinhue is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving nefer nefer nefer's drugged body with the "house of the dead's " workers.<br /><br />gene tierney as baketaten, is brilliant! when she tells sinhue that he is pharoah, she looks like she could devour him (in his weakness). she is intense, brilliant and coldly beautiful.<br /><br />michael wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god. i believe that we are viewing ankhnaten thru the lens of egyptologist a. weigall. a view at the time that had a pre-messiah feeling about ankhnaten's vocation. did his monotheism influence the jewish people? note psalm 104. and other egyption imagery in the psalms?<br /><br />mr. peter ustinov provided the alter ego to sinhue. he is street wise and cunning a survivor. excellent acting as always.<br /><br />mature never thought much of his acting personally, his horemheb is fine as an ambitious "super patriot" who ultimately has sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power, (walteri's book).<br /><br />i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as sinhue's personality changes too easily. he has a living son (toth dies in the novel), power is handed to him through is half sister baketaten, he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs. so he became enlightened? he could have modified the amon priesthood as he was capable.<br /><br />but no! sinhue gives everything up, everything including his son's future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love?<br /><br />this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script!<br /><br />again the look of the film,colour, most of the costumes(nefer nefer nefer's gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family), music is beautiful.<br /><br />i will watch this film again easily.<br /><br />p.s. i know that you porbably know that horemheb did not directly succceed ankhnaten, but i could not resist stating this fact.
