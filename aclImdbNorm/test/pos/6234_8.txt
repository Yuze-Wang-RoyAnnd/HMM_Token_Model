slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie but believe me this one among those pearl that will stay longer after you turned of tv set. especially if you are a person easily scared this is the movie for you for which you wouldn't have stomach to take it full. even after so many years the movie hasn't lost its charm and thrill.<br /><br />no blood no gore but the thrill will for sure chill your spine out. the movie starts with the bang and it stay with the same pace till its end. bgm is nerve cracking and i remember this was the one copied in many indian movies those days. kings favorite? no wonder why... thats the only reason i wanted to see this and it didn't let me down. "don't turn off the lights"... coz you wont find enrique but may be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! beware. not for the lite hearted...<br /><br />two thumps up and i am going with 8 out of 10 which is pretty low but still i preserve my ratings for dramas...
