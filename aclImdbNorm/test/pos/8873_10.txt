in a really neat spin on hitchcock, larry (billy crystal) and owen (danny devito) lead unpleasant lives: larry's ex-wife has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote, and owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable. when larry tells owen to calm down by watching "strangers on a train", owen gets the idea that they should do criss-cross murders like in the movie. and just like in the movie, larry thinks that it's a joke, but owen's serious.<br /><br />how they came up with the idea for "throw momma from the train" i'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. there isn't a dull moment in it. and that ending was a hoot. crystal and devito are at their best, and anne ramsey is as much of a hag here as she was in "the goonies". a modern classic.
