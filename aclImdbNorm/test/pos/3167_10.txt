at first i couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. the day after i had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. the film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. the lead is clueless and cold. he is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. he moves from one place to another in a giant rv without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. by the end it's too late. since my first viewing of usa it had grown on me like a custom fit dream where life on earth is nothing but a weird experience. i am an artist and a buddhist and this film communicated to my senses. it was an ideal embodiment of impermanence. this may sound strange but somehow this film was able to touch me in a profound way like no other. i recommend it.
