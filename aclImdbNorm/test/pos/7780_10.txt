love jones cleverly portrays young african-american men and women in a clear, positive, realistic sense. i feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood. nia long and larenz tate worked well together and i hope to see more work from the two of them. as a matter of fact all of the actors/actresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romantic-comedy from them. this movie can be compared to most any well-written, romantic comedy. if you have not seen this movie already i strongly recommend that you do, it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love.
