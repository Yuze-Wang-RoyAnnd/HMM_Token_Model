i was recently given this film on dvd as a gift, and was unsure at first if it would appeal (although one of my favourite actors has a leading role). in fact, it's on its way to becoming a favourite.<br /><br />first of all: thankfully, it's *not* the same as the book, the ending of which i think is excessively melodramatic. secondly: it's one of the best films i've seen about the first world war. "what?" you may ask. "it's not a war film!" true: we see no battles or bombardments, no trenches, no gas. but it shows the cost of war, the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it, and the impact this had on those close to them.<br /><br />we first see helen (sarah miles), a baronet's widow, awaiting her release from a mental hospital. all the women in the film appear to be widows: some from the war, but helen's much-older husband, sir thomas (we see him later in a photograph) was taken ill and died while she was at a party, hence her guilt-stricken breakdown. she is lost and lonely. the wire around the hospital grounds evokes pow camps and the trenches: like many of the men in the outside world, helen is suffering from a kind of shell-shock.<br /><br />out of hospital, she has to find her feet in the outside world again: a world we experience through her eyes as bleak, desolate and unfriendly. her mother is unable to provide her with any real support. herself a widow, she has put up her own emotional defences, behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughter's distress. (like many people, especially in that time, she seems to find mental illness embarrassing.)<br /><br />ledbetter, the hired driver, becomes a supportive presence, and helps helen begin to adjust to life again, but she does not realise that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her. this is a superb performance by robert shaw. ledbetter is a former regular soldier, an ex-sergeant-major who runs a boxing club and has set up his own car-hire business. superficially, he seems tough and strong, dependable, but there are cracks beneath the surface: he has not really adjusted to civilian life. he invents (for reasons he later explains) a family and home life he does not have; he has brutal outbursts with colleagues, and affection-less sex. getting close to helen
