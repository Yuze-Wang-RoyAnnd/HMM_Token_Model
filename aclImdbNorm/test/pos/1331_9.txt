film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium. literature best carries a plot, because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure. film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is: a series of images grouped together. what soderbergh does in ocean's twelve is combine impeccable film-making technique with the free-flowing form of american movies from the 1970s. from looking at the comments posted recently, most people went in expecting a standard-issue heist movie, a la entrapment; it seems people actually miss the tiresome clich'es of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. soderbergh's directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie, but close-ups of pitt and zeta-jones forty feet high on the screen don't hurt either. a true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it's not.
