i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which emulated the pace and styling of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film. i'm glad i read (twice) the book first which is usually the case for me. i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly. but, still, it's often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts.<br /><br />i realize that davies is a very good adapter, but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay. davies, as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on dvd, wanted particularly to emphasis the more scatological bits in the book. i certainly enjoyed those, on film as in the book. but davies missed a half-dozen moments that are so excruciatingly, painfully tender which he could have incorporated if his sensibility were more feminine. <br /><br />i also would take issue with his use of the book's primary symbol, the rose.<br /><br />as the screenplay was plotted by davies, the denouement was inevitable and appropriate. but i really think that author waters' final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting. and i preferred way the novel let nan "come of age" than the way davies chose.<br /><br />one quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles. they are all wonderfully talented -- well, except for the singing and dancing, perhaps -- and, moreover, their physical presences are so much what the mind's eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film. i thought they were all terrific.<br /><br />i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction, add both the book and the dvd of tipping the velvet to their bookshelves.
