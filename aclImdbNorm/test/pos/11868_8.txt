one night, barkeeper randy (matt dillon) rescues jewel (liv tyler) from her jealous boyfriend utah (andrew dice clay). he takes jewel to his home. but utah comes back and wants randy to open the safe at mc cool's. suddenly a shot - utah's dead. then... ...i'll better stop here to tell the plot. that's like to explain the story of "wild things". what i found so interesting, was the fact that the plot (written by stan seidel, his first and his last work - he died in july last year...) was told from 3 perspectives - the 3 men that fall for jewel. everybody of them sees her from different eyes - like john goodman as the detective, who tenderly falls in love with her because of being remembered of his dead wife...<br /><br />no wonder that the guys fall for her! liv tyler - she's a real jewel. she made the big screen shining! she played her role as if she was in a 40's noir- thriller. sweet - but in the same time she was the cool vamp who walks over dead body's and uses the men for her needs. and, of course, michael douglas. how could i forget him? mr. burmeister, the bingo-playing killer - he was quite cool!<br /><br />but in the last 10 minutes there was a little bit too much slapstick for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. that part began when paul reiser (as randys cousin carl) putted on his leather dress for jewel. the "ymca"-song didn't fit so much here... ... but altogether, "one night at mc cool's" is a pretty cool film-noir parody!<br /><br />
