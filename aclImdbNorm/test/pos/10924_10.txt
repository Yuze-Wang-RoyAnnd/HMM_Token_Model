first and foremost i would like to say, that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual. someone that cared about others, appreciated others, found no/barely any judgment against other people, and this film has (i think) changed my life or viewpoint dramatically. when i watched it, i didn't know particularly what it was about, i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship, but other then that i was clueless, and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters, i was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. the first time i watched it, i was blind. blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their pureness as human beings, to their relationship. i watched it a second time, because i finally figured out how hypocritical i was being, saying to myself and others, "oh i accept all types of people, and try not to judge them" while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story, because of my fear i suppose. the second time i watched this film, i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time, and really looked, not at the type of taboo relationship part that i'd heard about all my life, but simply at two human beings in love. and i loved it, i loved the storyline, i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film, i loved the sharing of feelings, and i loved the strong bonds created. it is a really eye opening, beautifully done film that made me cry at times, and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually, remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what shape or form it is presented in....
