although flatliners is 15 years old, tonight was my first time ever seeing it. i had heard about the movie flatliners, but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period. well, i caught it on one of the premium channels and i must say that it was very good.<br /><br />this movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death. they have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him/her back to life. besides the all-star cast, this movie had some serious bite to it. just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough, but i really thought the writer & director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view. this was no generic attempt to thrill, frighten, and make one's mind race... this was the real deal.<br /><br />instead of making it an empty, superficial, star-studded thriller, this movie had substance. a nail-biter, white knuckle, edge-of-the-seat, hard nose thriller. i give it an 8/10.
