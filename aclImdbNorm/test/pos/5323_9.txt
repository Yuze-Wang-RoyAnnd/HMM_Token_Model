this is a movie that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. i will not give the plot in this post, i think others have beat me to it already. i hope that despite reading opinions on this site, you will take the chance and see this movie for yourself. i went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and i must say, after the movie was over there was total silence in the theater. after a few minutes i looked behind me and everyone in the theater was staring at the screen, lost in thought. this will make you delve deep into your psychological abyss to ponder several things:<br /><br />how much does society influence my life and the lives of my generation?<br /><br />how long does someone have to pay for mistakes that they have made?<br /><br />if there is a second chance given, is it ever realized?<br /><br />is it better to live in a box or to not live at all? <br /><br />my questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of leland's actions. i do not want my opinion of them to in any way dictate what you will take away from this film so i am not giving it. see it for yourself. i am still lost in thought, attempting to answer my many questions from the film. i enjoyed it greatly and hope that you will too. this film is not trying to answer questions, condone any action or promote any punishment. this movie is trying to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the rose colored glasses that most of us view the world through.<br /><br />great movie. 9 out of 10 stars
