i own the miniseries on dvd because i love this story so much. this is one of the best period pieces on the civil war that i have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. the costumes are great, the story lines are great, i love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. there is a great balance of good and evil. some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch. every time something more despicable than the last happens i curse the tv as if they can hear me. i love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in it's drama. i would advise however not to watch the third movie in the dvd series. it's a let down compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not return. i don't wish to remember how the third movie ended, i prefer to live with the thoughts of the ending in the second movie. it makes me happy.
