i had to call my mother (a wasp) to ask her about this. was it really that bad in the 40s in new york? surprise, she couldn't remember. so i told her to see the movie. arthur miller, in not a screen play but a novel for a change, was 30 when he wrote this in 1945. it is a painful depiction of anti-semitism. yet oddly enough, there is a tender story of human relationships (finkelstein, the jew, with newman, the non-jew, primarily) underlying the cruel story. the acting is competent and the cinematography is very good.<br /><br />the only reason i can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that it's >>aaagh<< controversial.<br /><br />i actually give it ten of ten. maybe a bit high, but it's so worth seeing.
