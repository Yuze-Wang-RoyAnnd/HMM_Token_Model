if i ever write movies or make them, i would want one of them to be like this one. i enjoy the goof-ball sense of humor and jokes contained within. this movie does stupid things without looking like it. the names of the places and characters are priceless, generic new york high school, squid calimari (george's sister), etc...genius. i've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable tv staple while i was growing up, of course i didn't get all of the jokes back than but it was still funny.this movie is a time-less classic.
