please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the radio city music hall! as an archivist re: the music hall..i know what is and what is not associated with the new york venue. the film's theodore is just the "music hall." no rockettes are in the film. only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. just thought you would like to know. truly a wonderful film. you will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. what a superb plot and beautiful ice skating. one never sees that kind of performances any more. the roxy theater and the center theatres, in new york city, had ice skating performances on stage!
