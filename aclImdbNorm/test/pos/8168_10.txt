i am a sociologist/anthropologist specializing in the field of symbolic interactionism, and i must say that this film exhibits high quality in the symbolic context throughout the entire film. to anyone who has not yet seen this, i recommend that you also read "man's search for ultimate meaning" by victor e. frankl. i think you will be able to draw some amazing correlations.<br /><br />that being said, i would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay, this is not a story about being gay. this is a story about seeking out and finding meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and terror that stand in your way. this is a story of seeking and finding balance and wholeness and happiness.
