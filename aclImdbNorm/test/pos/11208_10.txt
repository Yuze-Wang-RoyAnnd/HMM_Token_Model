hysterically painful; perhaps the kind of movie chekhov would have made had he made movies. what's really funny is that the two cousins have so very much in common (many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong).<br /><br />what's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just can't bring themselves to talk to each other - or anyone else! it's horrible. if you've ever been too shy, worried, self-involved, or just plain scared to talk to someone (and who hasn't?) you'll definitely see yourself in this film. and it won't be pretty.<br /><br />it holds a mirror up to the audience and says, "if you don't like what you see... change it".
