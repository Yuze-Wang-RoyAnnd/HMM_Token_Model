this movie is very silly and very funny. you can't ever criticize it for taking itself seriously. if you've heard their previous album or seen their hbo videos from the album, you can imagine the extremely foul-mouthed, rocking good time that is this movie which tells the fable of how the group tenacious d came to be formed.<br /><br />full of cameos, it not only gives a fictional account of tenacious d but is a send-up of musical history as well. the humor reminds one of something about mary in that they often "go places you'd thought they wouldn't," but it lacks the scatological humor of south park. this movie contains no nudity, except for mooning.
