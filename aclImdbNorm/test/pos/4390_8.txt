i was truly and wonderfully surprised at "o' brother, where art thou?" the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on renting, so then i came across this. i came home and as i watched i became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud. the coen's have made a magnificiant film again. but i think the first time you watch this movie, you get to know the characters. the second time, now that you know them, you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you. i strongly would reccomend anyone seeing this because if you are not, you are truly missing a film gem for the ages. 10/10
