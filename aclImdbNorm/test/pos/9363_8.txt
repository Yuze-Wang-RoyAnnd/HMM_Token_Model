rko radio pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award. the acting, script, continuity, et cetera, are all just about perfect; and the story is well worth the viewer's 82 minutes. although the picture soft-petals the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual -- such disguises never work, perhaps weren't intended to.<br /><br />i could nit-pick about a few details, but just for fun. there was no all-night movie house in washington, dc in 1947 --- and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldn't talk through the show. there weren't any bars where a gi could pick up a pretty blonde. none! if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news; not the times-hearald, evening star and certainly not the know-nothing washington post. but these little things take nothing away from this classic.<br /><br />the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score, except during the credits. i've only seen this done in a few films.<br /><br />on the negative side, since 1995 it comes with a tmc introduction where some liberal blabs about what the public was "ready for" in 1947... blah, blah, blah! as if this fool has any business judging his betters. i'd say the ex-gi's in 1947 -- the greatest generation -- were much smarter --and had better values -- than some commentator, film historian, or other wise-mouth in 1995. put a sock in it!
