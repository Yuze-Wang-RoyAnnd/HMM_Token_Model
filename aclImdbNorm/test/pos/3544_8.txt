guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the cannes or other film festival and one said "hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria." welllll...it kind of sort of worked. clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example bjoreling's nessun dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the dvd you got more than your money's worth. not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years. my favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet from die todt statd; okay a young naked elizabeth hurley is eye candy but her husband singing to her, his wife's ghost, is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to otello and desdemona's "gia nella notte densa" in all the operatic repertoire. could the flick been better, sure, what couldn't not have been but it's well worth a view especially of you're in a hyper-romantic mood.
