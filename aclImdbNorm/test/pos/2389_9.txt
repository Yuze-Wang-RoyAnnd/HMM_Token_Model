i was at a friends house for thanksgiving and watched a dvd of the movie, eddie monroe. i've been a fan of indie films for almost 20 years, (i loved the brothers mcmullen), and was impressed how good this movie is. my friend, who works at magno sound, told us that this movie was shot on super 16. the photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot. furthermore, the music combined with fred carpenter's direction, was art. the storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching...very cool. the acting by the entire cast was good, especially the actor who played, uncle benny. he was amazing. this film was a nice holiday treat, and i was delighted to be one of the first to view a movie that many will be seeing in the future.
