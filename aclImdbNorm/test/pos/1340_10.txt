this was one of my favorite shows when i was a kid. it had it all--music, stories, a talking squirrel, and chuckling daisies. i wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing. i'm 35 and i grew up in south jersey, but we got three new york channels with our cable hook-up, and i think it was on channel 11. they just don't make shows like this anymore (i know that makes me sound really old), and it blows my mind that i grew up with only 9 channels on our tv, but i could always find something cool to watch. i've only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show. she's three years younger than me, and she grew up in north jersey. i would love to see this series on dvd, so i could show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see what silly (but great) stuff her mom used to watch! i just found a vhs tape of a few episodes, and a music cd from the show on ebay, and i bought them right up, even though they were a little pricey. i can't wait to get them to re-live the great memories!
