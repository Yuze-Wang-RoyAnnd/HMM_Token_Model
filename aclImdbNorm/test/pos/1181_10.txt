movies aren't always suppose to be about deep, provolking thoughts. sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality. out to sea fits the bill perfectly. <br /><br />a light hearted "golden years" romantic comedy, out to sea may not be big budget, you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still very much a movie worth watching. a sweet movie that needs to be given a break. <br /><br />this is just good, light hearted fun. it's not meant to be a deep movie. it's something worth watching. if for nothing else, you must see it for brent spiner's humorously stiff and uptight rendition of oye como va. gil is a character you love to hate and mr. spiner pulls off the perfect evil comic foil to two beloved comedy movie gods.
