i finally have seen the real reason why peter boyle became famous. it wasn't being the monster in "young frankenstein" or being cranky frank barone on "everybody loves raymond". for younger people who only know him from tv,give this film a try,it makes frank look like a saint.<br /><br />"joe" is boyle in his finest acting role and as someone mentioned,most likely gave the inspiration for "archie bunker" on "all in the family". i think boyle even went back to "joe" a little to play frank. (i say this because i noticed the basement of both "joe" & frank barone look similar.)<br /><br />i knew nothing of this movie when i checked it out of the library,i just knew boyle and susan sarandon were featured. yes,susan does look great here and for a young actress a very good early role. a young hippie wanna be,who escapes her parents home and lives with,the ultimate lost in a drug induced haze hippie,who also sells as much as he buys.<br /><br />after a near-fatal over-dose on too many pills,she is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her things,her mother wont go into the smelly,run down apartment but her father does. while dad gathers up her things,her boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words and then the father does what we will later hear joe say he'd like to do to a hippie.<br /><br />joe is shooting his mouth off about how he hates different cultures/races,hippies and a laundry list of others. when he says,"i'd really like to kill one of them",the father (trying to look like he's kidding)says,"i just did". joe almost buys it but then takes it as funny. <br /><br />later,when the police are at the scene and the story is in the paper,joe realizes,he wasn't kidding. instead of nailing the rich guy for money through blackmail,he actually,kind of,does blackmail him. by just wanting him and his wife to "get to know" him and his wife. long story short their association is awkward but after sarandon gets wind of what her father has done,the bottom is at risk of falling out.<br /><br />how this all plays out in the end you'll have to watch for yourself. although it's over 35 years ago,the ending is something you wont expect. unless you've seen the film before of course. again,i recommend it mostly for those who haven't seen it.<br /><br />10 stars for boyle not just playing someone completely opposite his nature but for what will show others that he was more than just a tv and movie comedy actor.
