what can i say? the little kid inside has always had great affections for the following...giant robots, giant monsters and a cackling, megalomaniacal lead villain and this movie delivers on all counts. as an adult, it's easy to point out the many flaws in this film and to say hey it's really only a bunch of episodes taken from a children's tv series strung together. despite all of this, i find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature. tremendous fun if a little nonsensical at times.
