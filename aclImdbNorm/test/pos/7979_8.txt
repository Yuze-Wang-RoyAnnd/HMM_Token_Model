for a long time, this was my favorite of the batman films. it had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - catwomen and the penguin - along with the always-interesting christopher walken. however, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, i now prefer the last batman: batman begins, with christian bale.<br /><br />the good - nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day batman films. the stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the batman movies. director tim burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. the three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. of the villains, i preferred catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other batman stories but one is never bored watching this. as he did in the first film, michael keaton does a fine job playing batman/bruce wayne.<br /><br />the bad - for a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, i still think these first two batman movies, both done by burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. that would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. danny devito's "penguin" is downright gross in spots. "grotesque" i can handle, but who wants "gross." few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful michelle pfeiffer playing catwoman. generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.<br /><br />overall - fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. sorry, but i prefer a kinder-gentler batman movie. after all, it's just a cartoon. most will disagree, but i was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.
