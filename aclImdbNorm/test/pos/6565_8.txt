hey now, i have never laid eyes on a manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. ah well, such is life. anyway, this is a pretty bizarre, to say the least, movie, as things literally spiral out of control in a small japanese town. people are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches her friend's father videotape a snail, and later in the movie, people start becoming snails? it also seems this boy's dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance. there is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a tim burton movie, but there is some nastiness & gore like only the japanese can do with justice. as with a lot of japanese films though, the ending is the ending, and did anything get resolved? well, not to my mind, it didn't. there are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren't explored and there's a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn't deemed important. still though, there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren't obsessed with everything making perfect sense, this is well worth seeing, because it's just so original and bizarre. my favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
