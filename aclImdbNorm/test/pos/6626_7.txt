it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie. after all, it's all about the impact of war on civilians and it's by the "king of depression", ingmar bergman. in other words, so many of bergman's works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director.<br /><br />even though it is more difficult to watch, the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity. that's because initially, the main characters (liv ullman and max von sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent (though a bit stupid) people. however, as deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially von sydow) become less and less humane and more animalistic--doing anything in order to survive.<br /><br />fun to watch, no freaking way! but, an interesting insight into human nature.<br /><br />ps--1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they finished the wine completely! in most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. it drives me crazy, as i would never leave a $4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it! bravo!
