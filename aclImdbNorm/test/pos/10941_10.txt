the twins effect - chinese action/comedy - (charlene choi, gillian chung)<br /><br />this vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie. first of all, the characters are memorable, contributing a myriad of classic scenes. charlene and gillian are naturally cute, charismatic, and humorous. this movie was my first exposure to them, and all i wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a really big hug. the remaining cast did well in their supporting roles, including jackie chan, karen mok, "the duke", josie ho, edison chen, anthony wong, and the vampire bad guys (one of which looks eerily familiar to will ferrell). even the abominably horrible ekin cheng was good in this one. good characters are important, of course, because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences.<br /><br />and speaking of action, this film has plenty of it. more importantly, there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography. one aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists
