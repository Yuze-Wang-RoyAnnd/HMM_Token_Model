no, i have not seen the original series and i won't compare the two if i had. this series is filmed in canada in vancouver and victoria, british columbia. the series is well-written in a different story each week. some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. i loved the afterlife episode with clancy brown and barbara gerrick and the deprogrammers episode with the irresistible brent spiner as a deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species. it's funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like v but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth. the stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch.
