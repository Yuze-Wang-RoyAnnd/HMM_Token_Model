halloween 666 (1995) the producer's cut review!<br /><br />halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to part five. if you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. a mysterious "man in black" has raided the haddonfield police department freeing micheal myers. in the process poor jamie lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. what they want with her? who knows, but let's just say her long suffering will end soon. doctor loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop michael myers from killing any more innocents (good luck). a friend of loomis, doctor wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor. another old face from part one guest stars as well.<br /><br />this dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing. for some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film watcher's time. so they decide to dumb it down. then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office. no matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. they should have left well enough alone. hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now....don't they?<br /><br />producer's cut :highly recommended <br /><br />released version: not recommended
