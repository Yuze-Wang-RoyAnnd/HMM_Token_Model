this is another of john travolta's "come back" movies, and if he continues on with characters and movies like this one, his come back will take hold.<br /><br />this is so sweet...sickeningly so if you're not into the romance comedy scene. if you are, this is one innovative romcom. every performance (including that of skippy the dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in "dogma." (although, as movies go, i loved dogma!)<br /><br />travolta is not nearly as brash in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe. he is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read, then you understand that angels were far from perfect. you will not, therefore, be insulted by this film. even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldn't be insulted by this work, as nora went to great lengths to see to it that it was the least abrasive as possible, given the subject matter.<br /><br />i love this, and love it more each time i watch it. it's beautiful and sweet, engaging, and endearing.<br /><br />it rates a 7.3/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
