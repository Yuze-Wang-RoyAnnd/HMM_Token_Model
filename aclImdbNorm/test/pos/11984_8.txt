this b&w film reached the spartan movie house of my frisian village about 18 months after its release. in those days much of our full-length comedy fare hailed from denmark (nils poppe anyone?) so this movie struck like a thunderbolt -- it had me weeping with helpless mirth, rotfl as we'd now put it. ok, so some of the sight gags were in fact recycled vaudeville 'schtick', but how was this 'barefoot boy with cheeks of brass' to know that at the time? in any case, my favorite scenes had jerry's unique brand of frantic clowning, like that hawaii boxing match.<br /><br />seeing "sailor beware" again fifty years later i still guffawed loudly at the goings-on. granted, without the nostalgia component it would probably be just another fair-to-middling comedy. but then, another movie that once had me in stitches even more helplessly, the spike jones outing "fireman save my child", now seems dated and stilted apart from some too-short orchestra bits and doodles weaver scenes. must be some special ingredient that makes martin & lewis product stay fresher longer. to me this one at least rates eight out of ten.
