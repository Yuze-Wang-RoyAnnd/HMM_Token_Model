for all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film ("like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?"), here's a word you might want to think about:<br /><br />beauty.<br /><br /> beauty is an under-rated concept. sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. but when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? there is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. this is depressing hogwash. there is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. a director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so. <br /><br /> '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. it requires you to relax. it requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. there are different kinds of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, pure beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.<br /><br /> "all art is quite useless" - oscar wilde.
