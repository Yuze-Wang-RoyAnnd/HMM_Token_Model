i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time. i have seen it well over 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching) it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in. i highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again. buy a copy now it is a classic!!!!
