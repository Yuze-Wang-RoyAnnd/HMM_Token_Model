those two main characters erkan and stefan are a munich comedy act. i was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is either not important or simply not existing. but when i saw this movie i was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it.<br /><br />all in all very amusing and not a common german movie.
