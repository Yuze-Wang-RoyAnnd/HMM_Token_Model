if you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feel to it this is the one. if you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off- then this isn't the one for you.<br /><br />for the budget that this movie was filmed on, the music was particularly amazing! even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget!<br /><br />the story was truly well done and the director is to be commended. there is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! the acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which i am definitely holding out for! i have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic.<br /><br />in a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a grave-robber. it tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the robber duo encounters. vampires to zombies and even aliens! our stars start out as simple grave-robbers stealing for jewellery but quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor (angus scrim) who requires bodies for his medical practise. when the duo find a way to have a vampire dispatch their cruel employer the grave-robbers discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing regular dead bodies. the only problem is that there is another gang called the house of murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses- and thats where both grave-robbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences.<br /><br />this movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that i have seen in years and reminds me of the evil dead. don't miss this one, you will regret it!
