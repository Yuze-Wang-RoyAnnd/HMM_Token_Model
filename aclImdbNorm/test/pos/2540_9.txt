in his descriptions of caa, platinum card lunches in hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in provincetown he never took, and free trips to nicaragua, financed by columbia pictures.<br /><br />it sounds narcissistic, but spalding gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.<br /><br />this monologue is not just about "the killing fields", or "swimming to cambodia"; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them. some of the lines are classic, as when gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at caa. the conference table is ..."full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an oregon lake...there are no drugs now in hollywood".<br /><br />this was before the tragedy occurred. many of us will miss his off-balance humor. 9/10.
