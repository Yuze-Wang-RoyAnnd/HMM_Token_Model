i felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that i rented from blockbuster. this movie has it all - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and "realism".<br /><br />this movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor! i will definitely watch it again! there were some funny parts as well as action-packed drama. i enjoy movies that keep you wondering what's going to happen next.<br /><br />the writer/director, travis milloy, should make more movies!!! in my overall opinion, this movie was great! i'm looking forward to his next one! travis milloy has real talent as a writer and director.
