no real plot, no character development, no scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as borat. sure, the ending drags a bit, but if borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. sacha baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive, and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach. i dare you not to laugh.<br /><br />if you can pull the ten-foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character, see this stupid movie. you'll be glad you did. keep it real!
