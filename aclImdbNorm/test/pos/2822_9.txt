i'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because i really liked this film. if you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring ben idiot affleck or some other hollywood loser. it's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. however, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed. people who like euro flicks will like this one. adam sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and definitely not their style.
