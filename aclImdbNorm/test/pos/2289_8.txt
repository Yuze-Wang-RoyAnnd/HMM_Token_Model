many believe this movie is a baseball movie. such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball.<br /><br />some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed. this movie is not a romantic comedy.<br /><br />this movie is about culture. an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't, indeed, won't understand one another. it's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success. the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement, and they meet in the middle.<br /><br />baseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures. many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think it's a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief. it's not---the culture clash is the gravamen of the movie. based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture, i think this movie did quite well in that it didn't overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayal.<br /><br />overall, i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about.
