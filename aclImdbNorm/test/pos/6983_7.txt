in the future, a disparate group of people asleep aboard a commercial spaceship is forced to improvise their survival when the spaceship crash-lands on a remote, barren planet. they already have one problem in that one of the passengers is intense criminal richard riddick (vin diesel, in his first top-billed role); however, they are soon preyed upon by a strange species of predator that thrives in the darkness - and a rare solar eclipse is soon to take place.<br /><br />while the script for this movie is ultimately on the routine side, it is decently acted and it is especially well-made technically. location work, photography, and design (production as well as creature design) are all very impressive. it is not the most original or stimulating science-fiction / horror picture ever made, far from it, but it still provides good entertainment. diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character. it is not entirely predictable, however, and gets some points for<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />having a more politically correct ending than most of its type.<br /><br />filmed on location in the desolate coober pedy area of queensland in australia.<br /><br />a sequel of sorts is in the works.<br /><br />7/10
