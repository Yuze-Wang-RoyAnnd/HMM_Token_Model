i honestly didn't think at first that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects, boy was i wrong! from the very beginning to the very end the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by spoofs from other titles like "evil dead" and "gremlins". this movie could be compared to peter jackson's works of art, though this movie isn't as gory as "braindead", but i sure wait these guys'll make another splatter movie.
