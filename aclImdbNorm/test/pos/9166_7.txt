this movie was much better than i expected. after a couple of films by will smith that weren't that great like i, robot, he is back to being likable and fun in this one. smith plays, hitch, a date doctor. most of the film centers around him teaching albert how to be himself and get a date with allegra cole, a rich famous celebrity whom he works with. albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what-not. all hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around allegra.<br /><br />during all this, hitch meets sara, a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men. hitch charms her, so of course, they go out. but, hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them, he doesn't believe in love himself. he has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. but, he likes sara, so keeps going after her. sara's friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor. so sara tracks the doctor down, only to learn its hitch. so of course, she thinks he's a pig. then it's up to hitch to explain to sara and allegra what he does, so they both end up forgiving.<br /><br />final verdict: good, has some laughs, and is entertaining. i recommend it.
