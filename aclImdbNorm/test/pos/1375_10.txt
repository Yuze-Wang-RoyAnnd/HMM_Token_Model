i loved this movie! yes, it is rather cheap and i'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that. but my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved. i was reminded of the early work of sam raimi. yes it is rough, but has good energy and plenty of fun. the acting ranges from the very good in scott ironside and shawn paul hasser, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. is it a cult movie? well it grew on me. first time i liked it but by the 3rd viewing i was loving it. the movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but i'm giving it 8 for sheer cheek. anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth watching. almost makes me want to visit scotland!
