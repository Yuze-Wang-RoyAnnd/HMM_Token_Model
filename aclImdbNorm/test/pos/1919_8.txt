this is an excellent documentary about a story i hadn't heard about before. the first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. it's a truly fascinating story about man vs. nature and man vs. himself. the story focuses on donald crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. the film elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. the story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of donald crowhurst. this is one of the best documentaries of the past few years. it has true human emotion in it as the men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world non-stop on their own.
