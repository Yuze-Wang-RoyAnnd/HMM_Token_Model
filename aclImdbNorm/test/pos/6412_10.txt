this movie, one of the best i've ever seen, talks about incommunicability. it does it plunging ourselves in a livid taipei, stained in cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; a damp world. it does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world, a man and a woman. a coincidence, or the fate,links their existences, but they're not able to open one to the other with words. characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning interpersonal relationships. an incommunicability that here is taken to the extreme limits. all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie, dialogues are nearly absent, and when some words are spoken they're often weak and empty, far away from describing people's real feelings. so, the progression of the story, the revelation of character's feelings is developed (brilliant idea!) by the musical digressions, only apparently meaningless, that speckle the movie. the proceeding of the sentimental event, and the drama of female protagonist, lead us to a splendid ending, heavily symbolic. a movie totally different from the usual, a clever realization by a great-talented director. ps. forgive me for my bad grammar!!
