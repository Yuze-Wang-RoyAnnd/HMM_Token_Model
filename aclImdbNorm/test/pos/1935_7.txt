this is one of barbara stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. she's making money by dancing with men at a dance hall. she really doesn't like the work, but it's a living. her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy ricardo cortez. well, after marrying, it turns out her "nice guy" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy. by the end of the film, barbara simply has had enough, as any sane woman would walk from this horrid marriage.<br /><br />in the 1920s and early 30s, hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. while ten cents a dance isn't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened production code was created and enforced starting in 1934. in some ways the code was great--after all, parents didn't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in ben hur, 1925). however, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no 1934 and thereafter. this is really a shame, as i don't think ten cents a dance was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (barbara stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. even so, allowing the film to end with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just couldn't have been.<br /><br />overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. give this one a look.<br /><br />fyi--sadly, ricardo cortez was actually not hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was jewish. he was an excellent leading man of his time, but today is all but forgotten.
