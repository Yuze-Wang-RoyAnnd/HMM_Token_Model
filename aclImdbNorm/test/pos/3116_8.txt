the performances by the male leads make this long-hard-journey west interesting throughout. the soundtrack by the sons of the pioneers is one of the most beautiful i have every heard. the journey itself is somewhat episodic, and joanne dru is badly miscast. overall, this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western.
