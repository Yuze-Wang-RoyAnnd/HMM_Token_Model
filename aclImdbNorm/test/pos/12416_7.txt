i caught this movie on the sci-fi channel recently. it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b-list horror/suspense films go. two guys (one naive and one loud mouthed a**) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them. things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie, unlike so many others. the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scenes. nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff. definitely worth checking out.
