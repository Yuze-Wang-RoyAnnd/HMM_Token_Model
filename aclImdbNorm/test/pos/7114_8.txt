this is another universal fun filled fright fest.many people want to compare it to house of frankenstein.even though it has similar cast and the same director it can stand on its own.(it does appear that erle c kenton directed most of the universal horror films of the 40's).<br /><br />the plot recap:baron latos appears at the home of dr eidlemann seeking a "cure" for his vampirism.larry talbot (who somehow survived house of frankenstein) also shows up at the good doctors door seeking a cure for his affliction.after a failed suicide attempt talbot and the doctor find the frankenstein monster. to complicate matters just before he bites the dust, dracula infects the good doctor with his blood.the doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times.where this leads to is something you'll have to see for your self.<br /><br />carradine actually gives a very good performance as dracula. he isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles. it is hard to repress giggles when he appears in a top hat though.the cape/cloak is traditional but the hat has to go. where does the hat go when he changes into a bat...?<br /><br />onslow stevens gives an excellent portrayal of the doctor. he's torn between his basic kindness and the increasing blood lust he is now prone to. this is a very underrated performance.chaney brings even more life to the wolf man in his 4th appearance in that role.<br /><br />the monster isn't given much to do this time.just lay on the table until the end(some stock footage from the ghost of frankenstein is used).at least in house of frankenstein he was up and around a bit.<br /><br />yes this does stick to the basic universal pattern complete with the angry village mob running amok with torches.but it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.it gets a low 8.
