"pixote" is the one of most powerful, shocking, and moving motion picture to come from brazil. it's about the lives of street kids on the streets of sao paulo and rio de janeiro, and it centers around a ten-year-old boy. the camera follows them around in an almost documentary style;from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and it never turns away from the horrors of the city. prostitution, drug use/dealing, corruption, and murder are all witnessed by these youths; yet it's something they're painfully used to. director hector babenco used real street kids as the actors, adding to the films brutal reality. although not for everyone, a film i highly recommend. an emotionally devastating movie.<br /><br />
