this is a cute film starring spanky, alfalfa and buckwheat from the "our gang" comedies. set in the south during the civil war, it may seem a little odd to see buckwheat as spanky's slave, but this film is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast. this was the only our gang feature film, and i highly recommend it over the little rascals remake from 1994.
