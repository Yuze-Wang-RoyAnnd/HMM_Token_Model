this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. in many ways, it's like a 50s version of valley of the dolls--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of valley polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in the best of everything does have aspirations of broadway).<br /><br />the film begins with hope lange coming into the company for her first day of work. she's assigned to tough-as-nails boss, joan crawford, who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades. despite how nasty crawford seems, lange is determined not to give in--to make it in this job. and, over time, she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor. at the same time, her two new roommates also try to move up the ranks--one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy. like valley of the dolls, all of them have their ups and downs (mostly downs) but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make it--battered and bruised, nevertheless.<br /><br />in this film, men are mostly pigs. the only guy who seems decent is played by stephen boyd, so naturally hope lange neglects him for a ne'er do well ex-boyfriend. as for the guys played by veteran character actor brian ahern and the rest, they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how crawford became so bitter and nasty.<br /><br />this film has it all--adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc. and is certainly not an artistic triumph. however, thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script, this one is a joy to watch. just don't expect shakespeare!!
