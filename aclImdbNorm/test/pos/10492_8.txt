out of the 600 or so spaghetti westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere. can not believe this hasn't received any reviews! gemma is excellent in this. van johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off killter but that's the charm of the italian style. beautiful photography and some excellently staged action. all the supporting characters are well played. the severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to gemmas character in some of the situations that take place. absolutely fantastic score by luis bacalov. see this is in the wonderful wide screen dvd from japan. a spaghetti must have.
