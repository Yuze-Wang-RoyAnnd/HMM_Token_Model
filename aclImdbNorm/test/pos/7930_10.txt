eisenstein wasn't just one of the greatest soviet,russian, films'directors, but one of the great masters of the cinema, among griffith, murnau, ford, hitchcock, welles, and others. one of the greatest things in all his films was the edition, very personal, and in this movie is exceptional. this was his first sound movie and the use of the musical score by great russian composer serge prokofiev in the sequence of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image. watching this film is like taking a class or lesson in cinema, something that no many film directors can afford. i never get tired of watch real classics like this film. i hope that in near future more people will recognize a great work of art.
