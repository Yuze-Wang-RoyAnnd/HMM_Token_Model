uzumaki has a formidable reputation within lovecraftian circles and now i know why.<br /><br />uzumaki is based on a manga title (which, unbelievably, is allegedly better than the film) and follows the bizarre events preceeding a typhoon in an isolated japanese town. i'm not about to tell you anything that happens in this film because it is an absolute must-see movie. i watched it for the first time last night and i was blown away. it shot into the my top movies of all time and leap-frogged pans labyrinth as the best fantastic movie (literally and photographically) that has been released in the last decade.<br /><br />this movie is very lovecraftian in nature without formally having any direct connection to the cthulhu mythos. it has been made in the same way that lovecraft composed his stories; it exudes power as an aura of 'something's not quite right here' intensifies through a brooding phase to dread and, ultimately, horror through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and the cinematography. this is, indeed, a "weird tale" par excellence.<br /><br />simply stunning.
