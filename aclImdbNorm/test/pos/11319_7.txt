i lived in london most of my adult life before i moved stateside so missed this film when it came out and only saw this now on hbo. i disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a hollywood production, the uk team gave it a chilling and foreboding atmosphere from day one and i was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what was going to happen to my home city. and of course,nine months after the film comes out 7/7 happens. yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. having lived in both countries, it is also clear the likelihood of this happening in the uk is much greater than in the us, muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the uk, in the us they assimilate much more readily.
