yes, this film is another remake. yes, this film can be considered a chick-flick. and yes, this film is not perfect. the women is however a clever modern update on the social behaviors of all women, with an impressive cast of a-listers including meg ryan, debra messing, annette benning and bette midler.<br /><br />the film revolves around four main characters, mary (ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, sylvie (benning), alex (jada pinkett-smith) and edie (debra messing) and the out-of-this-world female creature who is responsible for most of the film's drama,named crystal (eva mendez). mary is trying to deal with her cheating husband (who's never actually seen in the film), by following the advice of both her friends and her mother (candice bergen).<br /><br />aside from mary, there's sylvie who's torn between her social life and her professional life. she has decisions to make that test her moral and ethic values. then there's writer alex who's a lesbian, with a lot of spunk, but knows her way with words. and finally edie with four girls and another baby on the way, who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end.<br /><br />together the women live for revenge, rely on each other, and give each other life lessons. but it's the cameos by bette midler, candice bergen, cloris leachman, carrie fisher, and debi mazar, that show the cruel and usual behavior of women. bergen plays ryan's mother, she's tough, silver-tongued, experienced, and yet feels she could have become what her daughter does later. there's fisher who shows how to blackmail and test the boundaries of selfishness, morals, and betrayal. mazar, the gossip girl, that shows no mercy for what she says and whom she says it to. leachman who plays ryan's sassy housekeeper, she knows her place, when and where she's needed, and how to deliver a good one-liner. finally there's midler, who plays leah miller, a crazy eclectic but wise hollywood agent. she's the one character who gives ryan's mary an epiphany on who she truly is by discovering "what do i want." despite midler's scene stealing performance and memorable quotes, she was underused.<br /><br />but back to the film, together the women show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until the time comes when you answer that very own question. it tackles feminism, what it means to be a woman (fierce, ruthless, bad-ass, tacky, smart, sly, clever, shy, proud, ashame, self-conscious, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what it is that women want, why are women the way they are. it's funny, modern and by all means not a masterpiece. but the bottom line is, it's worth the money and time to see veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women.
