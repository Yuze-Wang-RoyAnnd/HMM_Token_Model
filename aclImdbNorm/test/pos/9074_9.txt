five medical students (kevin bacon, david labraccio; william baldwin, dr. joe hurley; oliver platt, randy steckle; julia roberts, dr. rachel mannus; kiefer sutherland, nelson) experiment with clandestine near death & afterlife experiences, (re)searching for medical & personal enlightenment. one by one, each medical student's heart is stopped, then revived.<br /><br />under temporary death spells each experiences bizarre visions, including forgotten childhood memories. their flashbacks are like children's nightmares. the revived students are disturbed by remembering regretful acts they had committed or had done against them. as they experience afterlife, they bring real life experiences back into the present. as they continue to experiment, their remembrances dramatically intensify; so much so, some are physically overcome. thus, they probe & transcend deeper into the death-afterlife experiences attempting to find a cure.<br /><br />even though the dvd was released in 2007, this motion picture was released in 1990. therefore, kevin bacon, william baldwin, julia roberts & kiefer sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting careers. besides the plot being extremely intriguing, the suspense building to a dramatic climax & the script being tight & convincing, all of the young actors make "flatliners," what is now an all-star cult semi-sci-fi suspense. who knew 17 years ago that the film careers of this young group of actors would skyrocket? i suspect that director joel schumacher did.
