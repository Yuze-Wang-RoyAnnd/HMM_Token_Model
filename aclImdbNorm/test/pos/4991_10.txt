i am very impressed with the acting in comanche moon. before i started watching this, i wasn't expecting it to be as good as lonesome dove. i couldn't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. it blew my mind how well they played each role! this was in my opinion almost as good as lonesome dove. its hard to compare any film to lonesome dove. if you don't make that comparison, i would give this a thumbs up. it was very entertaining! i don't post many comments on this site, but i just felt i had to get my opinion out there. amazing! i don't want to go off naming every actor who was brilliant, because i would probably have to list every single one. my favorite was steve zahn. he hit the nail on the head playing captain gus. his mannerisms were perfect.
