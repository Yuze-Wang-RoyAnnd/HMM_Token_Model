let me depart from many comments i've read here, and say that this film ranks as one of the five best bonds, along with on her majesty's secret service, from russia with love, licence to kill, and for your eyes only (the only time roger moore actually played the role of bond, instead of futzing around). of course, sean connery pulls the whole thing together -- as co-writer, co-producer, and in his best performance since from russia with love. he is fit, energetic, and obviously enjoying himself. his acting is mature, confident, and laced with the right amount of humour. this is in contrast to his mechanical performance in thunderball, his sleepwalking through you only live twice, and his jowly, paunchy romp through that cartoon known as diamonds are forever!<br /><br />this is an imaginative reworking of thunderball, without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot. this cast is far superior, as well. klaus maria brandauer brings his unique style to the role of largo, without relying on an eyepatch, spectre ring or a boring uniform. kim basinger is athletic and lovely, barbara carrera is dynamic, and for once, we have a great felix leiter in bernie casey. the depictions of m and q are original, and the addition of the bumbling agent small-fawcett is fun without lapsing into slapstick.<br /><br />director irvin kershner makes good use of his locations (the bahamas and the french riviera) without losing sight of his actors. although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike thunderball (which even its director, terence young, did not like). obviously fans will miss the gun-barrel trademark and the 007 theme music, but they are, after all, owned by eon productions.<br /><br />michel legrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly intrusive. not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of france, with his french love song (at the health spa) being particularly attractive. and tell me, how many really remember the music for moonraker? i personally would rather forget man with the golden gun and a view to a kill!<br /><br />the eon folks can sneer at this film if they like. (yes, octopussy made more money.) at least connery's mature 007 didn't swing through the jungle emitting a tarzan yell. he did not frolic with a bengal tiger, nor did he fight off "indian" snake charmers with a tennis racket. despite eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, kevin mcclory and the late jack schwartzman put together a fine film, one that i think ian fleming would have appreciated.<br /><br />if, however, you would rather see james bond get kicked in the shins by a dwarf, engage in another tiresome struggle with "jaws", jump into bed with grace jones, or lead a slapstick firetruck chase through san francisco, this is not the film for you!
