i have no read the novel on which "the kite runner" is based. my wife and daughter, who did, thought the movie fell a long way short of the book, and i'm prepared to take their word for it. but, on its own, the movie is good -- not great but good. how accurately does it portray the havoc created by the soviet invasion of afghanistan? how convincingly does it show the intolerant taliban regime that followed? i'd rate it c+ on the first and b+ on the second. the human story, the afghan-american who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood playmate, is well done but it is on this count particularly that i'm told the book was far more convincing than the movie. the most exciting part of the film, however -- the kite contests in kabul and, later, a mini-contest in california -- cannot have been equaled by the book. i'd wager money on that.
