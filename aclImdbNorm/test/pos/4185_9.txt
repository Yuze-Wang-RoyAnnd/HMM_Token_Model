pity the monkees. people always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a american knock-off of the beatles (again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. discussions about who were better the monkees or the beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever. beatle fans may argue that "hard days night" was better and i am sure that many of the kids think "8 mile" was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as "head" and that is probably why it failed.<br /><br />if head had told a direct a to b type story perhaps it would have appealed to the bands young fans but by pushing the envelope and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really sabotaged the film with their fans. could you imagine eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5% (and i am being generous) of the acts are white. if you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the monkess to sing "hey, hey we are the monkees. you know we like to please. a manufactured image, with no philosophy". when you have a film in which frank zappa tells davy that he should focus less on the dancing, and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected.<br /><br />the story, what there is, concerns the boys trying to flee their manager, who at one point forces them to play dandruff in a commercial, but every time they run away they end up inside a box. i don't think you need to be fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit. some neat little comedy bits follow with davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big match and peter refusing to throw away a ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded. even if you are put off by the story, you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music.<br /><br />any film that begins and ends with mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge (at the end the band follows him) is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film.
