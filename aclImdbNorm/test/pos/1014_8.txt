i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. what's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. the story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. the pace in languid and the settings are exotic. the film has a lot going for it. unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. according to imdb, al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.<br /><br />the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! i kid you not. ridiculous. we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. while the footage rolls, al and annie start making out. this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.<br /><br />speaking of drag, another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives. a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. in fact, orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with annie belle. this is another minor complaint about laure: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. it just needed more skin to punch it up.<br /><br />except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, laure is actually very watchable. i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.<br /><br />p.s.: make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt, which stars annie & al but also another famous screen couple, laura gemser and gabriele tinti. the music in that movie is also great.
