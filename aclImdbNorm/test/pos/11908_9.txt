this film is just really great. i don't know why. i alway have a weakness for damian chapa. it's not scarface, but still i really enjoyed my self. this is a film i can see more than ten times. he really try's to make a good movie, but he just can't do it. i feel pity for him, so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy vote. i can't help it, but i just can't give it less than 9 stars. everyone should have seen this once in his life. to see how to make a cheap film work. i live in holland and bought this film for only one euro! that's 1,50 dollar. i would have also bought it for ten euro. great great great. on a little dutch film site this film gets a 101 votes. here only a 260. that's not so much more. so people all over the world. buy this movie!
