'in the line of fire' tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former-government assassin turned psycho. the secret service agent/bodyguard (eastwood) is on defense and the assassin (malkovich)is on offense. the stakes? the president's live.<br /><br />i really like this movie...i've seen it numerous times on tv and have recently bought it on dvd. yet, it's not an excellent movie. the plot is way too thin and the attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous. the whole love-story isn't very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story, just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer. though i feel these mistakes can't be forgiven, i can easily look past them to mr. malkovich exquisite performance. i've always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie he's really on fire. there's a reason why he got an academy award nomination. rene russo and clint eastwood were okay, but i don't deem their performance to be memorable. they're never at the best of their abilities.<br /><br />if you don't expect too much, you'll certainly like this movie. it's no masterpiece but john malkovich is really extraordinary and i don't think anyone can't enjoy his performance. really worth the watch...
