my two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and i were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. we were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was. david duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and minnie driver gave her usually competent performance. some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene minnie driver has with a fellow "transplant" donee. i liked the fact that it was a movie that i could watch with my children and i wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever. everyone in the movie theater was laughing and enjoying themselves. thumbs up bonnie hunt!
