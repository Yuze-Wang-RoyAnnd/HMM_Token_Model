what's there to say about "pink flamingos"? it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. you will either get it, or you won't, laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). john waters is an odd filmmaker (putting that mildly), mixing both innocent, childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to...well, who knows what his intentions were. it is like a form of assault, albeit a funny one.<br /><br />the thing that makes waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalries that form the plot of "pink flamingos". surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of "the filthiest person alive." what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates giddy, self-contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away. the people in his films are completely in tune with one another. for instance, when cotton tells babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because crackers is bringing his "lady friend" out to the trailer, babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her, in a conspiratorial aside, "that little shed's just perfect..." at this point, we do not know yet that crackers plans to take his "lady friend" out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while cotton watches orgasmically through a window, but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that waters creates.<br /><br />another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and channing, the marbles' deviant butler. the first time we see them, waters cuts jarringly from a scene in connie's cozy office to channing descending into the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very much alive and p***ed off. susan is not a cowering victim, but is enraged and abusive to channing, leaping up to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious. she does not let up for one second while channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film. later in the film, when divine and crackers break into the marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the marbles are pandering--here is something divine is unfamiliar with, a corruption devised by her newfound rivals, and she despises it. furthermore, while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about, she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free, relishing the revenge that they take on channing.<br /><br />at the other end of the filth spectrum, waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. the first time we see connie, she is belittling a minor character named sandy sandstone, who has never heard of divine. cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilariously matter-of-fact evaluation of divine's title as the "filthiest person alive", revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well.<br /><br />something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles, especially divine, who doesn't miss a note. not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given, and it takes "pink flamingos" to a new level or weirdness. people actually believed divine was like this in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who made it. since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary.<br /><br />but even more so, "pink flamingos" is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now (i say mostly because the a**hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince), i still find this film to be hilarious and habit-forming.
