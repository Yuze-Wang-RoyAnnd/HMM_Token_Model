it was a movie that made ya think a little. some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. plot did thicken at times and just when you thought angella (sandra) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead. all i got to say is that dennis miller should have been in the whole movie. his character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap angella went through. he would have lifted me and angella through the dumps.
