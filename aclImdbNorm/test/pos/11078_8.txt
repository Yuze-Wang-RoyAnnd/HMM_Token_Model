this anime recounts the tale of the battle for mamodo king. every 1,000 years, 100 mamado children are sent to earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original japanese, the creatures are mamono, which literally means magic/evil object). each mamado is paired with a human partner, and given a magic spellbook. the human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the mamodo, and when a mamodo is defeated, their spellbook is engulfed in flames (alternately, a mamdodo's book can be captured and burned directly). after that the mamodo returns to the mamodo world.<br /><br />the titular character is zatch (gash in japan), a 6-year old mamodo with electric powers. he is paired with kiyomaru takamini, and 14-year old genius. zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but learning that some mamodo are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a 'kind king'.<br /><br />zatch bell has drawn comparison to pokemon, but a better comparison is to digimon. like digimon, the mamodo and human have a one to one, symbiotic relationship. also unlike pokemon, both shows have an actual plot.<br /><br />zatch bell features character growth and evolving relationships, and some fairly adult story lines (like love vs racism; slavery; mind control; etc.). it even has some decent plot twists and mysteries.
