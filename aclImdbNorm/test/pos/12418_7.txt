i got monster man in a box set of three films where i mainly wanted the other two but still had a very pleasant time with it. it blends horror and comedy to reasonable effect, helped out considerably by the decent performances of eric jungman as the geeky lead, justin urich as his a hole friend and aimee brooks as the love interest. the film is fairly predictable and mines ideas from a host of other films, but stays fun throughout, with some good gruesome gore thrown in. sure it doesn't measure up to the classic gory comedies, but this still does fine. director michael davis even manages one or two creepy scenes, such as in the bathroom, or the bar. the film is watchable throughout if a little messily plotted and written and for me it only lost it a bit towards the end when the monster man of the title starts to resemble a member of slipknot and the film tries to go more horror style but isn't twisted or convincing enough. the final moments are a trifle weak as well. still, despite lack of much suspense and overall silliness, this is a good example of unpretentious, often gnarly splatter comedy that should endear itself to fans of the same.
