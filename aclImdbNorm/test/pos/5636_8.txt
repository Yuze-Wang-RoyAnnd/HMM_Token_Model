for me, the best & most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing i know nothing about. american movie is a perfect example of just such a gem. watching tv late one evening, i spotted the one & only good review among the dross - thankfully i settled in for a real treat. american movie is a documentary following the unforgettable mark borchardt (pronounced "orchard", i believe), a highly articulate & charismatic wisconson lad, as he struggles to write, direct and produce "midwestern", a gritty, low-budget horror movie on which he has been working for years. in mark we discover a young man filled with contrast. his appearance is of the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bum-fluff mustache, '80s heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. to camera however, mark reveals startling wit & insight as he philosophizes upon life, love, movies & the american way. as the movie unfolds, it sadly becomes clear that mark's lack of discipline & heavy drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. american movie is a charming watch, filled with hilarious moments & vivid characters. chief among these is mark's lovable buddy mike schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner who, having conquered an addiction to scratch cards, is now dependent on soda pop. i absolutely loved american movie. it generates real empathy between the viewer & principal characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. i would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.
