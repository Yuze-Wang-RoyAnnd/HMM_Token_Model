i first heard about the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya from a reviewer on youtube. he literally slapped the show with a big bad rant, condemning it rubbish and confusing. curious, i decided to watch the show (once i got the order of the episodes right, thanks to those who made the lists), and i found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch. great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and hilarious; a unique and not over blowing plot that makes sense now that i've watched the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. plus the opening and ending themes are great.<br /><br />the anime, based on a collection of successful manga novels, follows a simple plot, once you understand it. while the show's focus is on the main character, haruhi suzumiya, the point of view is from her friend kyon. kyon is a regular high school student who doesn't really believe in supernatural stuff (e.g. santa clause, aliens, time travellers, ghosts, espers) but he soon ends up talking to haruhi, who is the most oddest girl in the school and would prefer to date an alien, considering all men worthless. she even joined every club in the school to find something interesting, but quit as quickly as she joined. upon "advice" from kyon, haruhi decides to form her own club with kyon's club. setting up in the literary club room, haruhi forms the sos brigade - its mission to investigate supernatural cases (think scooby-doo minus the dog, the masked man and the mystery machine).<br /><br />haruhi "recruits" three extra members. the first is yuki nagato, a bookworm of sorts who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting. the second is mikuru asahina, a shy girl who is forced into the club by haruhi who thinks they need a cute mascot to get some things done. she is often forced into costumes by haruhi to further her cuteness. the third is itsuki koizumi, a friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling. while haruhi thinks her group is filled with normal people she couldn't be more wrong. while kyon is as normal as you can get, the other three on the other hand are rather unique - yuki is an alien, mikuru is a time traveller from the future, and itsuki is an esper (a person who has esp). all three have come to watch over haruhi who may just have the powers of a god, and if she becomes bored, she may be able to discover her powers and create a whole new world, and kyon is involved somehow.<br /><br />the show is worth watching with great characters, music and some hilarious and wonderful moments. however, for parents, there is some sexual references including mikuru's cleavage being exposed or touched several times, and several swear words used as well. apart from that, the show is one of the greats.
