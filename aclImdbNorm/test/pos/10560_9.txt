i have never read sarah water's book. although i have not read the book, the 3 hour movie is very interesting. it begins with an interesting storyline with a twisted ending. i have to say these 2 actresses are amazing. sally hawkins is stunning successfully portrayed the character in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love. their romance slowly blossoms as they spend more and more time together. the love making scene is very tender and emotional, well acted. the end is quite intriguing and these 2 ended up together after all they have been thru, which is a bless. overall, it is a great movie to see, a very interesting plot with excellent performances.
