this was really one of the most enjoyable specials that i have seen on tv. he is just an incredible performer. his personality shines through in each one of the songs that he does. i really wish this was available as an uncut dvd so i could watch it over and over without the -beeps- for explicit language. i have not had the chance to see him live, but that is something that i really want to do now. i can't forget his backup singers. they really added a lot of substance and humor to the show. with their campy style, and flamboyant dance moves, they really complement the true talent of dan. i wish there were some more of the songs that are on his live cd, which is also incredible. it is refreshing to see someone like him perform. just so incredibly personable and real, i really can't say enough good things about dan and this show. once again, i just wish this was available as an uncut dvd.
