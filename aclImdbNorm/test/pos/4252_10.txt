1969 was the year. new york city was the place. putney swoope was the second robert downey film to achieve some recognition. the first was chaffed elbows (1966). putney swoope achieved a much wider release. pound (1970) and greasers palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the prince's feature film career for several years.<br /><br />the subject at hand is putney swoope. and it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. i'm not going to go through the plot here. what plot?? people looking for a plot are going to be scratching their heads. keep scratching!! this film is not about plot! one could compare this to a mel brooks movie; only without the hollywood parody party that mel always threw. i also see a little bit of monty python in this. by the way: this film was shot before monty had debuted on the bbc!!! <br /><br />i notice that the gags and lines that are drop dead hilarious do not transfer well by word of mouth. you have to see them within the context of the film. there are some flaws in the film; but even the flaws are unique. for instance: actors often repeat the same line over and over again; and somehow it works. how many syllables mario? putney says the borman six girl has got to have soul! etc...<br /><br />the b/w photography is outstanding. the sound/score is even better! the editing is only so-so. the acting is above average. the script is priceless. the jokes are as un-pc as you can get: mr. bad news says "sonny williams just got caught in a motel with a 13 year old girl" putney says "well at least he's not superstitious" uptight conservatives beware. the anti-establishment mindset of this film will drive you straight out of the room. nothing is sacred.<br /><br />there are many things in this film that pertain to today: no smoking!!! reverse racism; with african americans treating caucasions like trash. the manipulation of mass media over the masses; madison avenue, deroit, hollywood intentionally pedaling something that any 8 year old can tell is pure garbage; the internet, i'm talking about "the drum"; interracial dating; i could go on and on....<br /><br />i should also mention that there is about 8 min of this film that was shot in 16 mm color. these are the commercials shot by putney's agency. the spots work fairly well the first time around. they get tiresome though on repeated viewings. the real magic here is within the b/w sections of the film. it's the non-scenically lines they stay with you: "rent yourself a chort schmuck". "i love you, i love you, i love you... did you take your pill?". "anything that i have to say would just be redundant". and a host of others. i also really like the bit with the mounted minnow up on the wall: "the game warden wanted me to throw it back... i put up such a fight, i decided to have it mounted!" <br /><br />standouts in the cast include buddy buttler as putney's bodyguard #1. he should have been a much bigger star. antonio fargas as the arab. he did go on to stardom on tv and in films. arnold johnson has the right look as putney swoope. robert downey used his own voice instead because arnold couldn't remember some of his lines. also downey realized that he could fill in any additional dialog/jokes later on if he dubbed his lead actor. <br /><br />the film does have some shortcomings. the short run time is one. i wish the beginning with the white board members would have been extended. stan gotlieb and allen garfield are outstanding. the ending seams to have been thrown together as if he just couldn't think of any more gags. all in all, this is one of the best low-budget independent films of it's time. a time when very few indys' played outside of new york, chicago, san francisco and l.a. anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice. downey's putney swoope is ahead of and beyond it's time.
