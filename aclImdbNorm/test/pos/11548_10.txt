oh my god ! i can truly say that maya angelou is one of the world's most intriguing and important people, especially of my culture. she is incredibly inspiring and her story is the story of a great woman ! when i first picked this movie up i thought to myself the cast was wonderfully put together now lets see them in action ! maya angelou is already my favorite poetess and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. i believe she is the greatest of all time. this movie had me on the edge of my seat and reaching for kleenex while at the same time reminding me that no matter where you come from if you decide that you are going to be great then you will be great ! and ester rolle played a wonderful supporting role...... 100% awesome...and now even "i know why the caged bird sings."
