this is a decent effort for a b-movie martial arts actioner. ian jacklin, a former north american cruiser weight kickboxing champion, is the lead and acquits himself well in the action scenes. the muscular matthias hues gets a chance to add more to his martial arts bad guy persona in this film than in all of his many others and if you are a fan of the teutonic titan, rent this movie now!<br /><br />renee griffin is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film. she starts off with attitude but soon warms up to the hero and they make "the beast with two backs" in a very stylish fashion.<br /><br />the fight scenes are good in the american tradition (no hong kong acrobatics here!) with added realism from having benny "the jet" urquidez playing himself as john larson's (jacklin) trainer.<br /><br />all in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre so you get more of a story.
