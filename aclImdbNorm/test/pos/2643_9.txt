straight up, i love this film. i love everything about it. it has a great soundtrack, it has a lot of recognizable faces and it is funny as hell. there are so many plots in this film and every one of them is funny in one way or another.<br /><br />where as spicolli lit up the screen two years back, drake is almost as memorable of a character. all he wants to do is have fun. he moves out of the house without his parent's consent, he skips work whenever he feels like it, he is obsessed with sex, he loves his drugs and booze and he tries to be a good friend. it is his lacksidaisical attitude that makes him such a joy to watch. and he comes out with some great lines. and there are so many tiny observations that you don't see coming but they make you laugh at the sheer velocity when it hits you. one particular moment is when tommy and bill are talking about bill's ex girlfriend dating someone else now. at the end of the conversation, tommy takes his huge beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder, casually. he then says good night and the scene ends. it is a perfect scene. tommy's world is his own. he really lives to party and have fun. when the conversation is over, his time is over and he doesn't care who he offends in the process. he has an innocence about him. "it's casual" is his favourite saying.<br /><br />another such classic scene is reggie handing bill a donut. he says something to him that me and my friends will never forget because we rewound the film ten times and watched that part over and over again and hurt ourselves laughing. it has to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />wild life is a throw back to when teen comedies were funny, raunchy, had a good ear, entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world for 90 minutes. wild life does all those things perfectly. if this is a film that you haven't seen, give it a chance. it is a classic.<br /><br />also check out the army store guy that jim has problems with. he is a very familiar face now and it is his first role on the big screen.
