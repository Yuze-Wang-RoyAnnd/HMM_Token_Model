great movie in a trainspotting style... being billed as the welsh trainspotting, but then so was twin town, although this is streets ahead.<br /><br />takes in a weekend in the life of cardiff clubbers, good debut movie from kerrigan and some great performances in the cast.<br /><br />go see ! then go clubbing
