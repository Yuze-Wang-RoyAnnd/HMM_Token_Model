the d.i. (4 outta 5 stars) wow, i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did. i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day. i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie d.i.s as portrayed in "full metal jacket" or "an officer and a gentleman". boy, was i wrong. this is probably the best work webb has ever done... far and away better than his one-note "dragnet" performances. the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant... done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you *know* that the guy means every word of it. the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling. even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked. anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song "if'n you don't, somebody else will"? webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever... and he's under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but, by golly, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he's gonna drag him out kicking and screaming! great stuff!
