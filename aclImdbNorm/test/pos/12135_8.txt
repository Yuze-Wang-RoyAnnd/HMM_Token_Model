so ya think you've seen every mafia movie ever made! here's one that nobody every heard of. it's a low-budget, quickie b-movie - shot in the swamps of jersey. for us mob-movie fans, it had a little bit of everything - sex, violence, cursing, and wise guys acting like "gafones". while violence dominated the movie, i found myself laughing at some familiar scenes i've since seen on the sopranos and goodfellas. look for a 1977 version of the "badabing girls" in the beginning of the movie. <br /><br />all our favorite mobster stereotypes were featured here. and, as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! joe pesci was superb, portraying the classic wise-guy character like we seen him do so many times over the years. this was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick. you have to look carefully for it since it goes by different names. my copy called it "the family enforcer". here it is known as "the death collector". but whatever name it goes under, it's should be called - a winner.
