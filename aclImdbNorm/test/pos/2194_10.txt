i can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. this is the first production i've ever seen of sweeney todd so i have no others to compare it to. but the impact is so strong, i just can't imagine anything better.<br /><br />first, there's the music -- take "johanna" (act ii), during which sweeney, anthony and johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. it's like a bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition. and the underlying chord structure and voicings are so perfect -- a little bit of melancholy, a little bit of contentment, a little bit of yearning, all expressing these three singers' points of view.<br /><br />then -- the lyrics. the rhymes are so clever. the rhyme schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end. (the dvd, which i watched, has closed captions, and these are indispensable for appreciating the dialog and the lyrics.) sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone.<br /><br />finally, the performances. i can't imagine anyone better than george hearn. why haven't i heard of him before? his singing, alone, is masterful, but the range of his acting is simply amazing. angela lansbury totally surprised me. the song about "you and me down by the seaside" -- who could do it any better? her timing is flawless, pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is accounted for; and overlaying this achievement in musicianship is her utterly delightful comic delivery.<br /><br />it's a dark tale but i found it to be sweet at times; and the tune to "johanna" continues to play in my head.
