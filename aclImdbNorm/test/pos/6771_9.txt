not entirely sure how i stumbled upon this movie, but i'm so glad i did. initially, we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read (especially at the weekend) enjoyed this film. i found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead-pan manner only added to the puddles of pee on my sofa. not entirely sure whether it's quite so funny to the native danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the tonelessness of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. i haven't watched many danish films (or any for that matter), but judging by this film i'm guessing they're not constrained by the same political correctness as elsewhere (gawd bless 'em) making the character of eigel a breath of fresh air, because let's face it special needs are funny. there are so many great one-liners in this film it puts american sitcoms to shame.
