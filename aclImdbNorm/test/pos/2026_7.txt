rock star is a "nice" movie. everyone is nice. even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life. he goes back to his girlfriend emily, who is also nice. <br /><br />it's a good movie, despite all the niceness. maybe i'm just used to all the angst of the x gen music. in some ways the film was a caricature of rock stars and not hard edged enough to be believable.<br /><br />mark wahlberg's acting is quite good. jennifer aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated. she was a nice girl. <br /><br />go see it. if you have ever been to a rock concert or seen spinal tap, go see it.
