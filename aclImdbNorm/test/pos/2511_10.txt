i normally don't like romantic films, but i love this film very much. the story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. i feel i really care for many characters in this film. i feel i can feel their feelings. while most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of capshaw running along the beach with scott until the ending scene. i want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because i want to give an extra one point for the ending. the acting part is very strong. kate capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent. though i'm not impressed with scott in `dead man on campus,' this film completely changes my viewpoint towards him. he's so irresistibly charming here. geraldine mcewan is as terrific as ever.<br /><br /> this film might not be as good, complex, deep, or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship, such as `l'ecole de la chair' or 'post coitum, animal triste,' but `the love letter' can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship. and that difference makes this film eminently enjoyable. by being unambitious and relying on great charms of small stars, dreamworks, this time you really make my dream come true.
