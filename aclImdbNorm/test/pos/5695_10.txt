black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.<br /><br />in the tradition of all good animal centered thrillers ie jaws, the edge, the original cat people, the directors know that restraint and what isn't shown are the best ways to pack a punch. the performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.<br /><br />if you are after a b-grade gore fest croc romp forget black water but if you want a clever, suspenseful ride that will have you fearing the water and wondering what the hell would i do if i was up that tree then it's a must see.
