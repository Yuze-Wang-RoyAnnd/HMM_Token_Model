one should not be too critical about the director's second feature.<br /><br />i really like the camera work of madiba. as mr. shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things.<br /><br />however, howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? remember he has not got any education of any sort. i don't think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos. worse still, madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14.<br /><br />any way, if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work.
