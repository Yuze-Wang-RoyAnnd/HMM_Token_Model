i loved this movie but then again i am a big cronenberg fan. if you have not seen a david cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start. scanners, the fly, rabid would be a place to start and then work up to videodrome before checking this one out. this is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.<br /><br />in this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system. it is very hard to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget. it is full of cronenberg's slimy body works, dark foreboding scenery all populated by a great cast including jennifer jason leigh, jude law and willem dafoe who take the situation they find themselves in very seriously. these people will do what they can to figure out the game and then to win at it. like other movies of his there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat but like an auto-accident you don't look away. if you liked any of the movies mentioned above then by all means go out and get this one.
