chop shop. written and directed by ramin bahrani ( man push cart). bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in new york. <br /><br />these are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. they exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in america is appears somewhat doubtful. where do they come from ? how did they get there ? how do they cope ? where will they end up ? these are not feel good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most basic, day to day level. <br /><br />ale is one such street kid. he has no education and hustles anyway he can, to save money, he is also not beyond turning to petty theft. mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister. we see him in the early scenes ringing a safe house looking for her, but not having any real success. a young friend, carlos gets him a job in a chop shop, in the shadows of shea baseball stadium. eventually his older sister comes to live on site with him, but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money. he dreams of buying a food van and setting up a vending business with his older sister. <br /><br />bahrani shoots all his films on location. there is nothing glossy or glossed over about them. this is life as these people have to live it, in the raw. lt is not pretty although it is never ominous, and the slightly despairing air that hangs over much of the film, is the same one that hangs over these peoples' everyday lives.<br /><br />the script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of scope and room to work in. polanco is outstanding in the lead role, and gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister.
