i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive b-movies. it's not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes.<br /><br />at first, it seemed like a typical haunted house film, and feels very much like the forerunner of clue, murder by death, house on haunted hill, etc.<br /><br />about a half hour into the film, the storyline takes a really interesting twist--and it goes from being a clich'e melodrama to something entirely different, and far more entertaining than i had initially thought.<br /><br />check it out, it's a great deal of fun, even if the long clips and wider shots (and near lack of music score) make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards.
