i can honestly say that "death bed: the bed that eats" was a much better movie than i expected. allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague - there is a bed that eats. an evil bed. it eats people. several unsuspecting women on an "outing" of some kind, stumble across the sinister "sack" and ultimately fall prey to it's hunger. the bed's devouring process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into it's inner... stomach acid; all complete with chewing sounds. this is a very strange cult flick and the only film from george barry who had forgotten he made it until word-of-mouth of it's newfound cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on dvd. not a bad movie at all, if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects - the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking skeletal fingers... pretty dreamlike tone to it, too, coming across as very surreal and aberrant - mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed. if you like bizarre no-budget, oddball flicks than definitely seek out "death bed".
