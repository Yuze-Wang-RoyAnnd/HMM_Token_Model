not high art, not even exceptionally innovative, but a thoroughly enjoyable movie. funny, fresh, intelligent - there are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide that they're out of ideas.<br /><br />when you compare this to your average hollywood action flick, you're comparing a homemade meal with a big mac.
