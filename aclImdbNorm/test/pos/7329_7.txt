i was rather appalled to see the low rating this movie received here, personally considering it fun family fare. it revolves around a young teenager, sandy ricks, who is sent by his mom to coral key to spend the summer with his uncle porter. while there he befriends a dolphin named flipper. lots of adventures ensue amid the predictable nephew / uncle bonding as well as a little romance for sandy with a local girl.<br /><br />i'm a great crocodile dundee fan myself so absolutely loved paul hogan in his role as crusty and comical uncle porter. for starters, he keeps an endless stock of spaghetti-o's in his house to serve as his usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! elija wood, frodo from the lord of the rings, appeared quite competent playing the young sandy, a boy at first none too fond of his forced summer vacation locale.<br /><br />of course the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. set in the florida keys, it was apparently filmed in the bahamas. this adaptation of flipper makes great family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental, and fun movie that is infinitely superior to many of the cinematic offerings for youngsters nowadays.
