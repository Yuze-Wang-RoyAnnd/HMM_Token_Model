the elegant documentary -<br /><br />don't watch this movie ... if you're an egotistical know-all student of physics. this much less than one percent (miniscule fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know.<br /><br />do watch this movie! - if you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99% of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity, quantum, string and m-theory.<br /><br />what a brilliantly architected documentary. starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics. this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade.<br /><br />the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini-series split over three shows. it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence.<br /><br />we are all (and everything around us) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. this movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us (even with the hubble telescope) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high-school. m-theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of 'possibility'.<br /><br />it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it's very nature move (by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy.<br /><br />you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god.<br /><br />bravo brian greene. well done indeed.<br /><br />p.s. if you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the 'possibilities' quantum mechanics blended with spirituality (of all things) can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch "what the bleep!? - down the rabbit hole". yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn't seen one before (my eyes process light reflections just fine - i see things everyday that i've never seen before) and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don't divide. but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don't like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film.<br /><br />then watch "the secret" (2006 documentary about the law of attraction - search for imdb title "tt0846789"). this information just might change your life profoundly - forever. if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought (if you'll listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. there is a modern day jesus/mohammad/buddha (those, among others, that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in texas. i know some of you know what i'm talking about.<br /><br />i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now.
