if you have not heard of this film, it follows two sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in africa to america, where they convince themselves they will find success and riches. life is harder than expected in the states, and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right. the lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they're so perfect. whether it be on the job, at school, or the time in between, the two boys, peter and santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very thought-provoking comments about life in the states. it's one of the only documentaries i can recall that, when it ended, i wanted it to go on for another two hours. it might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn't get great distribution, but check your local "art house" or independent theater and give this one a go (side note, if you're reading this when it's already on video then definitely it's worth a rent). rating: 28/40
