watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish. the story is always entertaining, the tension never loosing up. the whole cast is wonderful. the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection, it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance. bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence. for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine
