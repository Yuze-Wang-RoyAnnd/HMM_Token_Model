"where to begin, where to begin . . ?(savannah in the episode "gimme shelter")" to disabuse: fox/viacom does not, at this point in time, have any intention of releasing the show on dvd. but be not downhearted! that you are reading this reveals that the magic lingers fifteen years on . . . and small wonder. this was post-modern television, a valiant attempt to visualize magical realism. 'neath the blue patina, charm, and brio were scripts bursting with symbolism and metaphor, music that actually interacted with scenes! and, ultimately, an attempt, however doomed, to recapture one's belief in innocence, to reclaim eden, as it were . . . it's potency is perhaps best attested to by the fact that even as we, umm, type, a book is being written about the show wherein will be found the thoughts, fancies, and reminiscences of many of the show's actors, writers, directors, and producers. in the meanwhiles . . . anyone desirous of once again visiting the end of the world and reacquainting themselves with seamus, sheriff cody, savannah, et al . . . should not hesitate to contact me, i may be able to make you a copy.
