set just before the second world war, this is a touching and understated romantic story that is loosely based on a real event.<br /><br />it concerns a german rocket scientist gerhart zucher (ulrich thomsen) working in britain in the advent of the second world war. fearing hitler may recall him to germany to assist him preparing for war, zucher and his slippery assistant heinz (eddie marsan) are evacuated by the british authorities to a remote scottish island. they are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland.<br /><br />mocked and bullied by the islanders, they set up home with local girl catherine mackay (the stunning shauna macdonald), with whom thomsen begins an affair but complications arise when germany comes calling...<br /><br />the central romance between zucher and catherine is subtle and sincerely played and the supporting cast is a colourful bunch with an array of respected scottish character actors including gary lewis and clive russell.<br /><br />fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect round out this movie.<br /><br />intelligent but undemanding, it is good for a quiet evening in.
