i saw this (video 2000) years ago and would love to see it on dvd. a good film, but i would have loved it even more if it had included the legacy of the beatles and the hollies etc.<br /><br />i also don't know exactly how true the story is - were some changes made to dramatize the story? <br /><br />i was only 3 when buddy crashed, and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70's. much later i found out our family moved into our new house on - yes, february 3rd, 1959.<br /><br />well ehelhell little things you say and do... his songs will always be remembered - always...
