if filming is about vision and real life this movie is quite perfect: nuovomondo talks about immigration in the usa from italy the beginning of '900, but it speak also for now, when emigration/immigration is still a focus . <br /><br />it doesn't to be rich to be a visionary film.<br /><br />acting at extra level, charlotte gainsbourg a star. a good challenge for the academy award 2007<br /><br />after first crialese's attempt, "respiro", an emotional but too intellectual movie, this one has learned fellini's and taviani's lesson, to name just two italian masters.<br /><br />plot is arguing, directing accurate, maybe just a little less melodrama would be more effective.<br /><br />if volver ( challenging for academy award next year ) by almodovar is a mature movie by an always brilliant director, nuovomondo deserves it more, because of his good effort to be a european movie for the american scene.<br /><br />and this is it!
