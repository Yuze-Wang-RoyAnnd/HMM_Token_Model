anyone who has seen ali g before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'ali g indahouse' <br /><br />although i prefer ali g when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.<br /><br />ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of ali g.<br /><br />if you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it aiiii! 7/10
