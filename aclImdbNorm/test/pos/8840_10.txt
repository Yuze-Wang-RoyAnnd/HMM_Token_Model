it couldn't.<br /><br />from the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout. the immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic, the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around.<br /><br />up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, the thing comes out on top and laughing. who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. i for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits. this wasn't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick. this film had feeling. emotion.<br /><br />i truly can't recommend this film highly enough. i have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching, let alone bettering, the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema.
