what can i say about this film other than the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history...and based on a true story! being old enough to remember the berlin wall when it was still used to contain a country, this film gives you a dark insight into the grim incarceration of east berliners, and their desperate attempts to escape, no matter what the cost. the film follows the lives of two families , who decide to escape using a hot-air balloon manufactured by themselves. forever fearing arrest by the authorities, under scrutiny by neighbours, they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. a tense & thrilling story of courage and determination which truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to west berlin and freedom.
