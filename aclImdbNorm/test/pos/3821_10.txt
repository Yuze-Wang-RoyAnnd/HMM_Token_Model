"think like a dinosaur" was an well-produced & executed show of the -outerlimits- series. the actor (enrico colantoni as michael burr) plays an impressively well and convincing protagonist-role. you can actually identify yourself with him and his 'introspective' feelings on what to do to the girl whom he has fallen for (because, he's been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until "kamala" comes to his life with a timid fear of performing the task of being transported. he then consoles her and let's her know it's all going to be alright; which ends up being an deception to both of them. more so something bad occurs and she (prototype) comes back....and her (clone) is sent to the other inhabitant planet. although, the -dino- and "micheal" have yet to find this out, when they do it's up to michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live. yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her (kamala) was very much related to what happen to his wife, his wife died similarly. this show professes irregularity and sorrow thru-out most of it. after the show you're left pondering...about what should have been done and you're stuck with the 50/50 of what's right from wrong. hence, the "balance" equation being solely there is no one.<br /><br />10/10 highly recommend watching this show.
