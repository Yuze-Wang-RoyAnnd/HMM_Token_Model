with a cast like this, i knew the acting would be amazing. still, i was cautious, as i always am of sequels. would it sustain the feeling of the first film? could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of ocean's 11? we'll never know, because they didn't try. at least, not in the way i expected. instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. if you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this. if you want a good laugh, with witty dialogue, quirky characters, and an absolutely genius scene where julia roberts has to impersonate herself, then you'll love ocean's 12.
