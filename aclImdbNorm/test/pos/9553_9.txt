rented the video for a slow saturday night. first viewing i thought it was funny. took a while to get used to the american caricatures (here we're more attuned to british grotesques) but very enjoyable. <br /><br />watched it again next night and really warmed to it. the characters seemed more human - lovable, even. a film one could watch several times and get more out of it each time. however, my wife *hated* it. no accounting for tastes in humour i suppose.
