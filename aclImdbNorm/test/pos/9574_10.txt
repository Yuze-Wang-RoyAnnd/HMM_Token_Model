this is the funniest movie i have ever seen. however, i have laughed harder at plenty of movies. this is because best in show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit. the improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke, but only until after several jokes build on one another, each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose.<br /><br />it's a well-shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting. i was impressed on my first viewing, but when i watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised, i was amazed. it was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other, build jokes out of nothing, and completely immerse themselves in their characters.<br /><br />i imagine the golden days of second city were like this.
