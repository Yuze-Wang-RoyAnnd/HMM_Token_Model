at school i was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned : orson welles and sergei m. eisenstein. i didn't care that much then (i was a kid!) but now i know why, eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies! some say this movie isn't worth the genius of eisenstein (then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad) or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the russians. let's say it as it is, it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't "saving private ryan" or "the longest day" so? i could sum up so many movies in where america is being raised to the top so why not russia, and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags? aleksandr nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture. perhaps it's all overseen but i am in wonder why this isn't included in imdb's top 250 where as there is so many overrated oscarcrap in it as well.
