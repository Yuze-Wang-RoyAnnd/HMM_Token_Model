i may be a sentimentalist. but i found this movie truly moving. it was the first movie that reduced me to tears. and it did it more than once!! i recommend it to anyone both gay and str8. religious or not! supporting co-star jackie bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners. the nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste. most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the mormon church to the lead character. it shocked me that this still goes on in the world. nevertheless i enjoyed this movie tremendously. this is definitely the best gay film since torch song trilogy. and much better than the other gay movie offering that year - the fluffer.
