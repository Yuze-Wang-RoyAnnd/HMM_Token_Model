the best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it. i have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time. i have great liking for good comics like the orgazmo,cheech n chong, monty python series and many others but this one in hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies. some of them recently in hindi are golmaal,munnabhai series and herapheri series. so all i can say is hind comedy is finally evolving. but andaaz apna apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above. its what i call the hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in hindi cinema.cheers to rajkumar santoshi for the brilliant movie.
