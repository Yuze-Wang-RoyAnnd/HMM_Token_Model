there are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one. this is the latest film from the dead gentlemen group responsible for the original gamers film and the demon hunters films. this group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progress.<br /><br />this film follows a group of gamers who are trying to finish a campaign run by a gm frustrated by his group's disregard for his story. with the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time.<br /><br />this movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original. the movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects launching it above the simplicity of college films. the acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny.<br /><br />unfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you may not find the film as funny as others. so this is why i give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that i initially thought of. any case if you are a gamer or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it.
