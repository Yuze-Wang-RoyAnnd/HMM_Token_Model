i thought this movie was good, i loved the plot, i loved the shoot out scenes, except for a few, they were not needed and i also enjoyed ma's character, she was a rider i liked that. i do have to say that in this gangster movie the actors were picked well because sometimes some actors just don't fit the role. however though i hate to say it, but i hated the ending, i felt as if it should have went in a different direction. also it would have been better with a little more details, its based on a true story but there was so much of the facts left out but other than that it was good. if you enjoy movies on the past gangsters you'll enjoy this movie.
