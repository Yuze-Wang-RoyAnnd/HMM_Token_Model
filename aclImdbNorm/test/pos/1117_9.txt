a wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ %entertainment. casey, buddy, kelly marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. the horses are real beauties.<br /><br />has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. the very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.<br /><br />andrew rubin puts in a wonderful performance as buddy,the sensible elder brother. somewhat reminded me of aidan quinn(eyes, speech delivery, facial appearance). <br /><br />casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the earnestness. sarah blue is also nicely portrayed by alexis smith. lloyd bourdelle, the father, is played by walter matthau and he is the character.<br /><br />though there is room for improvement in the movie, its a very enjoyable, feel-good movie.
