i caught this on late, late mexican cable and i have to rant about it. the title was translated as "secretos" (secrets). well there's a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on, ! we are not stupid. we know there's a novel behind this.<br /><br />anyways, the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid ramatic performances. the always beautiful and stunning jordana brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them. cameron d`iaz is also good although she has minimal on-screen time. blythe danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching, sad. great performances. <br /><br />jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died. through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and we can't help but feel sorry for the whole family. the ending is truly moving. <br /><br />so there's nudity but it's minimal. in fact, the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy.<br /><br />to be honest, i kept watching it for joranda brewster's on screen charming and beauty. and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations. <br /><br />give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. great movie. the last, last scene was very sad.. the two little sisters through flashbacks.
