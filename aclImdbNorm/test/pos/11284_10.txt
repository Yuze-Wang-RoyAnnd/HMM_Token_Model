a warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen on film, projected. the pixellation created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film. however, since this movie is pretty much unavailable in any format, i suppose you'll have to make do with what you can.<br /><br />anyway, this most excellent artistic endeavor comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us shadow of the vampire. it's a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements (as far as i can glean from the character names) through a process horrifying and surreal. begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the thematic.<br /><br />and visceral describes it. not very much stuff happens in the movie technically, but the levels of emotion it'll put you through are innumerable. the very repetitiveness of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses. the sound editing and score in particular are immaculate, and serve the imagery incredibly well.<br /><br />fans of this film would do well to check out the collections of short films released through other cinema dvd, experiments in terror i, ii, and iii. movies such as these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror resides in the abstract, abject, and non-narrative, rather than in spooky tales of ghosts and axe-murderers.<br /><br />--polarisdib
