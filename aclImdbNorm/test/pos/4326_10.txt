it was libby talking to desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital hurley was in) then you should know that despited libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.<br /><br />btw, great episode. it had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to eko and lock and what about the four toe statue?<br /><br />i cannot wait till season 3, lost just rules!!! i hope all the unanswered questions will be answered. i loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed. desmond did it when he did not manage to type in the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
