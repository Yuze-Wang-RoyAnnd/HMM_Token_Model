okay. you saw the film and i saw the film. true? if not, there are plenty of plot summaries out there, and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another.<br /><br />the most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads. their emotional honesty was as compelling, if not more so, than any performances i've seen in recent months. i found i laughed, cried and cringed right along with them, and that's saying a great deal because i'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk.<br /><br />as one would expect, the story is rife with clich'es and i suppose that's the achilles heel of the picture. it's a story we've all seen many times before; we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce rory. though you may not know exact mechanics, you know there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet romance and a gut-wrenching conclusion. if it weren't for the strong cast and directing, this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the hallmark channel's program schedule.
