i saw chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. it is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. the simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. it is also thought provoking. with deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. movies have different genera's and different purposes. this movie, which is delightful to all ages, offers an interesting humorous look into our own experiences. everyone will recognize personality and behaviors types of themselves and others. everyone will see the humor. the humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /><br />for lighthearted laughter and a 'feel good' movie chomps is an excellent choice. memorable.
