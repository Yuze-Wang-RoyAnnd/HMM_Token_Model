i saw "the reader" at a film festival in manhattan this week. it touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. in ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. duncan rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. what i really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. these are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. this is no small feat. haven't we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format, or stage stories that weren't properly adapted to screen? i applaud "the reader" for really doing it right, and i encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously. worth every moment!
