(warning: spoilers!)<br /><br />five young people ignore the warnings of forest ranger george kennedy and hike up to the misty oregon mountains where they are stalked and butchered by a pair of huge, deformed, in-bred hillbilly twins. when only two are left, warren and his girl connie, they resort back to their animal instincts to stay alive. the film ends with connie shoving half of her arm down one of the killers' throats, choking him to death. a very powerful, if somewhat overrated, backwoods slasher flick thats effective use of lighting, sound and photography make it a cut above the usual friday the 13th cash-in. lead by an attractive, likeable cast, especially deborah benson (where is she now?) and gregg henry, this nifty companion piece to director jeff lieberman's squirm (1976) and blue sunshine (1977) shouldn't be missed.
