if you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction)cyborg film "nemesis", then you'll love this one. i loved it the minute the elvis pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. like "nemesis" its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future. both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses. but thats where the similarities ends. the ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them. the rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to brake his suffocating hold on his subjects. after several failed attempts to brake the rebels back, he sends his top cop to assassinate the rebels. this movie follows the track of most action adventure but isn't afraid to color outside the line.
