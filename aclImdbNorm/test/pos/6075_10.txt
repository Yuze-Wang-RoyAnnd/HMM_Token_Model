even after all these years, this remain "a perfect movie" for me. i still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over, stunned by the experience, overcome by emotion. i own the dvd (of course!) is see at least once a year. it's incomparable and i cannot add much to has already been written about its excellence and beauty. so glad others love it as much as i do! a note: the author of the book on which it's based - michael ondatje - was enchanted with the film and is quoted as saying he wished he had thought of some of the lovely scenes written purely for the movie...the way kip "invites" hana to his side with a trail of small candles, and the way he arranges for hana to view the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.
