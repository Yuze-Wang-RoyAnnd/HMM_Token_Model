a huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track. i can't say it was riveting entertainment, nor a cure for insomnia. nevertheless i enjoyed the film - it provided the escape i was after one afternoon. a good look for those of us looking for the ideal life, albeit a fantasy. expect some corny moments, few thrills, and an occasional laugh.
