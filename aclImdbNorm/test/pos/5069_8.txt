i'm egyptian. i have a green card. i have been living in the us since 1991. i have a very common arabic name. i'm married (non-american but non-egyptian, non-arab wife). i have children who are born in the us. i have a phd in cell biology from the us and i travel for conferences. i make 6 figure income and i own a home in the washington, dc area. i pay my taxes and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets i have no blemish on my record since i came to this country in 1991. i look more egyptian than the ibrahimi character but my spoken english is as good as his.<br /><br />a couple of months ago i was returning from a conference/company business in spain through munich germany to washington, dc (home). i was picked up in munich airport by a german officer as soon as i got off the madrid plane. he was waiting for me. he was about to start interrogating me until i simply told him "i have no business in germany, i'm just passing through". he had let me go with the utmost disappointment. that was nothing compared to what happened at washington, dulles airport (which was not nearly as bad as what happened to ibrahimi in the movie). the customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip. he then wrote a letter c on my custom declaration form and let me go. after i picked up my checked bag i was stopped at the last exit point (some homeland security crap). i sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different nationalities. i was not told the reason for my detainment. i was not allowed to use my phone or any other phone. i was feisty at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see. i asked if i can call my wife to tell her that i'm going to be late but was told no. when i tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello", an officer yanked the phone out of hand and threatened me to confiscate it. when i asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting, they said "three hours is nothing, we will make contact after 5 hours". when i asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. it toilet was funny; i guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat. finally, they called my name and gave me my passport/green card and said you can go. i asked what the problem was, they said "nothing"!! i know it was only 3 hours but i was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids.<br /><br />as for the movie, it was very well made. unlike most movies that involve arabs and use non-arab actors who just speak gibberish, this movie the arabic was 100% correct. i assume the country is morocco (north africa).
