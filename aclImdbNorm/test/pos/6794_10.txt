this movie is ageless and would probably appeal to children today, even if there isn't a jedi in the entire thing. of course, elizabeth taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too. even mickey rooney is good; so are anne revere and angela lansbury. the world was a different place when this movie was released, and it certainly is a great place to visit.
