ingrid bergman, playing dentist walter matthau's faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth (ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). matthau is an odd choice for the leading man (he's too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. hawn (who won a supporting oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. this bedroom farce isn't terribly sophisticated (and faintly reminds one of "any wednesday" besides), but it's a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they turn out today. "cactus flower" is a lovely sigh! *** from ****
