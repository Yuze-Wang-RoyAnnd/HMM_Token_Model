this film is so 1980's and that is what i like so much about it. it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead. nothing effected them, not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends. how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society. glover is great, keanu is great, hopper is incredible. one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen.
