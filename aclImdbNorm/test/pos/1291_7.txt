"you were on your way up and you tripped on a skirt !" gilligan says to jim leonard. that sums up the plot of this story of up and coming leonard (a young humphrey bogart) when his dream gets sidetracked by the bombshell heiress carol, played by dorothy mackaill. leonard has been working on a new and improved motor, but now his love life and motor company both have their ups and downs in this 68 minute shortie. bogart hadn't developed the quiet, brooding style yet. good performances by most of the supporting characters - her butler, his co-workers, a sister, interlopers along the way. some adult themes, since it was done just before they really enforced the film code, but it's still tame compared to what is on tv today. directed by thornton freeland, a year before freeland directed the incredible "flying down to rio".
