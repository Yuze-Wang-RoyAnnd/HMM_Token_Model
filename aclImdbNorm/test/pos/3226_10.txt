this show is my absolute favorite. this show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. lauren graham is perfect as lorelai gilmore, a single mother who is rory's best friend. alexis bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent rory gilmore and keiko agena is one of a kind as rory's best friend, lane kim. i love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. kelly bishop is wicked great as emily gilmore and edward herrman is terrific as richard gilmore. scott patterson is a joy as luke danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch. the community, miss patty, babette, mrs. kim, taylor doose, kirk and other's are always laugh out loud funny, quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy one-liners stand out. this show has changed so much over the years that it won't ever get old. gilmore girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching. that is how good it is. i give this show a 10/10 rating.
