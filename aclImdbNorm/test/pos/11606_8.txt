i saw 2 hour version of choker bali. i cannot say that is long. the movie has a certain natural pace to it and does not seem to lag at any time. the costume and the set are reminiscent of what we would see in old movies.<br /><br />aishwarya rai has done a good job of acting. it is indeed a mature role with enough scope for acting within the story. the script also supports the story very well. aishwarys acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. the movie is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the downtrodden condition of widows in those times.<br /><br />her best friend in this movie is played by raima sen has also been well-handled. her innocence and her admiration of aishwarya's capability to speak english and act educated has been done very well. these are indeed some of the prevailing mindsets of those times. we can see how far we have come from such an era! <br /><br />the movie speaks of womens liberation as subtle line of the story. i found the development of the story very similar to ghare bahire also written by tagore. it does rope in some action from the independence struggle and puts in contrast the struggle for indian independence against the silent struggle for womens rights.<br /><br />a well made movie definitely worth watching. aishwarya's acting: par excellence. rituparna has handled the story with great care. yet another classic from rabindranath tagore.
