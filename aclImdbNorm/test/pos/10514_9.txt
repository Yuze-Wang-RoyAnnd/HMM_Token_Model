i was never all that impressed by night gallery, but this one episode stands out.<br /><br />a tv network executive auditions an odd act - a young, nerdy boy who proceeds to make prognostications. the exec dismisses the whole thing as a flaky waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning.<br /><br />what first seemed a parlor act becomes a hit show as the kid's predictions prove consistently accurate.<br /><br />then, one day, he refuses to do the show. facing imminent showtime, everyone's at wit's end, even threatening him with legal action if he doesn't fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions.<br /><br />the young boy relents, and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrow.<br /><br />after the show, the befuddled executive asks for an explanation, only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal.
