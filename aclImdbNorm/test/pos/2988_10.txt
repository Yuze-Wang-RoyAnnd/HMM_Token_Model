i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd under the name "algo mas que amigos" and you can buy there it is in english and spanish on the dvd....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't released to the u.s market. best of luck..oh for more info here is one place to look.... http://www.zonadvd.com i think it going for 10 dollars usd on ebay as well.
