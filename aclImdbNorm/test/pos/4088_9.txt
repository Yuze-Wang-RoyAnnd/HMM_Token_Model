like a few people i know, i came in late on 'stingers'; not until 2000. three years later there is no way i'd miss an episode. the show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'blue heelers', for example. the crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! when gary sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me. gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series. the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh. with arguably australia's finest crew behind the scenes, 'stingers' will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series.
