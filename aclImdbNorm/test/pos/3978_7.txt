a great movie. the movie was even better then the commercials put on. and believe it or not it was very very inspirational. i really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.<br /><br />it was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. i laughed. i laughed very hard on some parts. the acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. i can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being clerks ii). so after all of that i give it a 7/10 (a high seven, but not quite an eight).
