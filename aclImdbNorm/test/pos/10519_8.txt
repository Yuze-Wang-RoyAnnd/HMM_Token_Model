i've tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years. finally, read something today, 03/09/2005, that mentioned stacy keach's name, and it reminded me that i had seen a movie that he was in in 1974 at the atlanta film festival, so, i did a google search for keach's movies and found the gravy train. we were supposed to see duddy kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they were unable to show it, and instead substituted the gravy train. we were terribly disappointed that we weren't going to be able to see the much hyped duddy kravitz, and had heard nothing of the gravy train, and have heard nothing of it since.<br /><br />however, i recall we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was, and as i recall, it was quite humorous. would love to find it on tape.
