this version of alice in wonderland is truly original. equal parts porn, fairy-tale, and musical-comedy - this film is definitely a strange bit of adult-film history.<br /><br />alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the rabbit into "wonderland", where she meets all kinds of "experienced" weirdos like the mad-hatter (who likes to pull his dong out whenever possible), humpty dumpty (who broke his wiener along with his shell), tweedledee and tweedledum (a brother/sisters sex-crazed duo), and the bi-sexual queen - among others.<br /><br />this version of alice in wonderland is actually quite tame by the standards of the time - a time when a lot of porn was mean-spirited and nasty (as noted by the "roughie" sub-genre) - this one is actually quite funny and strangely endearing. it's the kind of thing you'd show your kids - if it weren't for the graphic sex. a little slow getting to the "good-stuff"...but genuinely entertaining. oh - and some of the musical numbers are downright hilarious. if you're a drinker - have a few, if you're a smoker - roll a couple and give this one a shot. 8/10
