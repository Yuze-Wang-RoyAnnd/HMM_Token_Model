critters 4 ranks as one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. the word classic has never been so aptly used as in describing this mind-blowing epic. i agree that the original critters is the best of the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which critters 4 is set really must be seen to be believed. i strongly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of twentieth century's major film landmarks.
