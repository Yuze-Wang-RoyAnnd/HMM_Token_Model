having seen this without knowing all the hoopla surrounding the lead character, indeed without even knowing that it was based on real-life events, i must say i am impressed. "murder in greenwich" is an above average production for a made-for-tv movie - the acting is uniformly great, christopher meloni in particular putting in a stand-out performance and the teen actors excel in what are difficult roles. the idea of the dead girl narrating the movie is a stroke of genius which elevates the movie from merely good to excellent. the script is exemplary for what is essentially movie-of-the-week fodder and the cinematography is beautiful.
