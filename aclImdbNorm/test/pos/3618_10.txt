being of cephallonian descent, i was happily surprised when watching the movie. i have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in cephalonia, but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. it is all true, the italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. the earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion. if you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it is not only a love story, and yes, there were plenty of italians in love with cephallonian women, in fact, boat loads of cephallonian women were taken to italy after the war, it is a true depiction of history.
