the magnificent greta garbo is in top form in this, her first talkie. she gets fine support from the rest of the cast which includes charles bickford the rugged sailor who captures her heart. ms. garbo gives a great performance as she usually does as the estranged daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years. also in the cast is that great actress marie dressler. a great movie!
