one of the two best films of the year. a well filmed, well written, well put together film with an outstanding cast. lau ching wan and his friends (dayo wong chi wa, anthony wong chau sun, francis ng chun yu, jordan chan siu chun, cheung man tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. theresa lee plays her comedic role well (though much like a female version of michael wong, her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native hkers.), and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something i haven't done since 1. the fan boys took over alt.asian-movies and 2. john woo's hardboiled. sure the ending was expected, but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members. highly enjoyable.
