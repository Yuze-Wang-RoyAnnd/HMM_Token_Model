seriously, i don't really get why people here are bashing it. i mean,<br /><br />the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd. the good news is, the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness. <br /><br />especially in the second half of the film, when the little killer snowballs attack, i laughed my ass off. for example, the put one of the little creeps into a blender (a la gremlins 1) and mix it. after that, it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice "that was fun!".<br /><br />bottom line - incredible movie, rent it.
