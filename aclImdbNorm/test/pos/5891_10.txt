best years of our lives perfectly captures the era of my youth, and the feelings of that time. the cast was uniformly wonderful. this was possibly dana andrews best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an academy award. there are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all. the cinematography is among the best of any film. this movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's. a must see movie for any true movie fan. some critics have said this movie has aged. i disagree. the theme of human desires is timeless. and the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us. this is just a great movie - one that can be watched over and over again.
