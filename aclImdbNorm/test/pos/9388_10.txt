i watch a lot of movies. a lot of movies. getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch 2-3 flicks a day for years. it all gets very exhausting. mostly because i feel i have seen it all. so rare is it when i get surprised by something, mostly i hope to see something as good as i expect it to be.<br /><br />death bed is so unlike anything i have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its genius.<br /><br />the rhythm of the piece is psychotic. it's structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame. it's not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots; death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy. the most pretentious way i can phrase it is: this is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie. i mean it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! and fried chicken! out in the middle of nowhere! and there's bone hands! i can barely articulate my feelings about this film. and yeah, copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule. but things get real same-y after awhile. its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged. i can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down. from what it is to how its put together. we need films like that, movies that shake us out of our complacency. consider it like existential camp. it's fun and it's stupid, but also brilliant in its weird little way. the worst horror villain of all time? maybe, but at least it isn't a guy in a mask.
