a western through and through. as the title character portrayed by glenn ford says, "no, i don't want to fight, but i will if it's forced on me." this movie is about being intelligent, strong, and fighting for one's beliefs. with courage, never stop striving for what you feel is right. great action and mostly quick paced. good to see brian keith in this role and edward g. robinson as an older western man. glenn ford lives up to his western image. thoroughly enjoyable film includes strategic non-military warfare. of course it's violent, like the title states, but not too graphic like in the computer-generated era films. it's mostly about strong personality clashes.
