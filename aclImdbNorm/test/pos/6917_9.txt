the original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls slumber party movie (2 times now). i loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, no boring drawn out scenes. it is violent and has a little language (though most of it is covered up). its a great movie. david strickland was a terrific actor. ron eldard gave a wonderful performance. i watch it with the girls every time.
