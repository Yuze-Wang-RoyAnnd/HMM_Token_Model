late night on bbc1, was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary-set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end. i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress, kelly reilly, who is stunning to look at.<br /><br />this is billed as a black comedy, which is one of the hardest things to pull off. it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don't know why you're laughing - for me martin scorsese's after hours (1985) is the best example. dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness. i didn't spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised.<br /><br />as a snapshot of the irish film industry in 2003, it all seems rather worthy; it doesn't look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back. the script could've been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good. i'm glad i watched it, flaws and all, tho i don't think i learnt much about ireland today, especially their policing methods!
