this review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie was...<br /><br />saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants, like my italian grandparents who came through ellis island at the turn of the last century, would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter america.<br /><br />it was certainly eye opening, since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there. my grandmother was 5-years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived.<br /><br />i just returned from a trip to new york where i had the pleasure of visiting ellis island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process - the filmmaker obviously did his research, right down to the medical exams and equipment, questions and puzzles. they are all there at the museum. even the wedding pictures and the review board room -- factually correct! anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie. inspirational to say the least.
