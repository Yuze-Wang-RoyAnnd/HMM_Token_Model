yes, this is one of the better done television movies and i wouldn't expect less from joe sargent. one thing for this reviewer is that i was also a great fan of the carpenters, i got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and i got to do much of the solo material of which karen sang lead. i thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing i was looking forward to was meeting this woman. i never got to, she died three weeks before that was to happen. and yes, that did effect me for i knew nothing of anorexia - and could not understand completely what happened.<br /><br />when this tv movie got produced, i got quite an understanding. maybe not everything in karen and richard's life is open to the television audience, but in opening the parts that were shown, i got to understand much from the music industry of that time. what upsets me is that i am writing "of that time" and seeing "now". no one has learned a darned thing, even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a family's problems in the music industry.<br /><br />these films aren't done for fun, they're done to open a door and show us something. here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight. she was fine. didn't know it. she got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved, the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looks/weight than the talent within. with the onset of mtv, it got worse. with 'american idol' it's like a puss festering in an english accent.<br /><br />a wonderful tv film, i am sure later someone may give it an hbo treatment but either way, many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent.
