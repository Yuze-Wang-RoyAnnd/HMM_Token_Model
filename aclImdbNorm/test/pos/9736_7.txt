i was a child when i saw this serial, a bit after seen buck rogers one, both characters performed by the same buster crabbe, and i must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment i've ever had. the fight against emperor ming was one thing but i was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of flash with dale and aura. barin came and persuaded aura to forget flash, very innocent termination of her obsession for good-looking flash. the serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences. another thing is that i learned floating in water looking the way crabbe did it when fighting against shark men. the soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of boris karloff's frankenstein. it would be nice to have the dvd of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in spanish (not yet available).
