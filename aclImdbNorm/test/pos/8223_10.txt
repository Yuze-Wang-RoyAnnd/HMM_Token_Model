the regard of flight and the clown bagatelles as performed by bill irwin are some of the funniest (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) performances i've ever seen. my father taped this special when it first aired in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since. we quote it back and forth fairly constantly. it's a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase. i have a bad vhs copy that i acquired from a specialty distributer a few years ago, but mr. irwin's performance deserves a proper dvd treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performers/producers as well as more examples of modern clowning.<br /><br />bill irwin's talent deserves more exposure to mainstream audiences than it has enjoyed in his limited wide release appearances. i share "the regard of flight" with friends quite often and though i am always greeted with a small amount of skepticism when i mention that it is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville i have yet to have anyone come away from seeing it without loving it. in case the powers that be ever happen upon this imdb listing, please consider releasing this and other bill irwin work.
