as a fan of dan aykroyd, i watched this film when it was recently shown in the middle of night on tv. i wasn't expecting much, so it came as a big surprise that i loved it so much.<br /><br />this is the type of film that dan aykroyd seems to love to make. a chance for him to 'ham it up' and not take things too seriously. if you loved him in the blues brothers or ghostbusters you'll know what i mean, and you'd be wise to check out the couch trip.<br /><br />avid fans of aykroyd will also have fun spotting all the tiny links to his other films in the script!<br /><br />i can't describe this film without spoiling it for you, so all i can do is tell you to check it out. i can't praise this film highly enough, and it must surely be time for a dvd release!!
