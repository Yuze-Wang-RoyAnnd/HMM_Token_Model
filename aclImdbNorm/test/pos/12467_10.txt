beautifully filmed, acclaimed director hugh hudson (chariots of fire) creates a story that brings the entire legend of john clayton, lord greystoke and tarzan of the apes to life with reverence and dignity, and with a scope not heretofore seen in tarzan films. christopher lambert makes his starring debut as the young lord, raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents die in africa. later returned to what is to him an alien world, that of class and privilege, he feels totally out of place. once he learns what has happened to the apes that raised him and their world he realizes that he must go back. a sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic vistas. this is one of those films that is a must for every cinemaphile's collection.
