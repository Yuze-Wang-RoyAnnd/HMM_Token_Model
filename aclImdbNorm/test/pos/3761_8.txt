"pearl harbor, buddy." this movie is brilliant! sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. i'm one that goes for silliness, much like "dumb and dumber", "airplane" and "wet hot american summer" and i have to say this easily ranks up there. movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece! when watching this, you will easily find over 20 quotes from it that you will find yourself quoting after-wards... and after to watch it again you'll find even more!
