i have just sat through this film again and can only wonder if we will see the likes of films like this anymore? the timeless music, the tender voices of william holden and jennifer jones leave this grown man weeping through joyous, romantic scenes and i'm not one who cries very often in life. where have our william holden's gone and will they make these moving, wonderful, movies any more? it's sad to have to realize that they probably won't but don't think about it, just try to block that out of your mind. even so, they won't have holden in it and he won't appear on that hill just once more either. you can only enjoy this film and watch it again.
