i had no idea who bruce haack was before seeing this film. i had just seen the moog doc, which was alright, the only problem was moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that bruce accepted the price of making music his way. there are so many elements that make up his legacy ie. invention of the peopleodian, where bruce could actually play music by touching people. it must have been challenging to document haack's 'scatter-brained' output, which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable (even rap music), but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. and the cast... what a group of characters bruce surrounded himself with, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, tripping with kids, fighting against the music industry. i recommend this film to anyone interested in music history, it's that mainstream, but that important.
