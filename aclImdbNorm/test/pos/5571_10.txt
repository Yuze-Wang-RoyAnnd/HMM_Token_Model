i'll admit that the first time i managed to catch sci-fi's "sci-fi prime" was last week, but despite the fact that i was a huge sliders fan coming into the experience, farscape is now easily my favorite of the four shows.<br /><br />unlike most modern sci-fi shows (including, regrettably, the two new star trek series), this show manages to be fun without coming across as fodder for mst3k.
