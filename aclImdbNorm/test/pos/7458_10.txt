i've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason: duck tales, darkwing duck, daffy duck, donald duck. though none of them are as deranged as duckman. originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale.<br /><br />the titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world. he's a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). you name it, duckman has done it. but who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he/we live in is so insane, outrageous and just plain nonsensical? eric tiberius duckman(voiced by the maniacal jason alexander) could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. my favorite has to be willibald feivel cornfed (or just cornfed pig), duckman's incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner's infinity of vices and incompetence.<br /><br />the typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household, though every now and again duckman's arch-enemy king chicken (tim curry), a sort of professor moriarty in fowl form, hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school.<br /><br />since i was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than the simpsons, family guy and even king of the hill. nothing will ever surpass it. there never was, or will be, anything quite like duckman ever again. the level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique klasky/csupo style (anyone who has seen rugrats will understand). it's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel.<br /><br />you can never have too much of this particular bird.
