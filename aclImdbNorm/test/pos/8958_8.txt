extremely good cinematic story of gay, embittered former teen star, now waiting tables. the sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically, and with an actual human face. this, and throw in a serial killer on the loose, and you have love and the human remains. a well portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. the screenplay is fluid and believable. the performances are well above average, and the twists in the story are sharp.<br /><br />this certainly isn't everyone's ideal notion of a movie, but for those who appreciate something different and slickly written, it's very much worthy of your time. highly recommended.
