this movie is based on the book, "a many splendored thing" by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites, a topic that comes from han's personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china. that background, and the beautiful hong kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time.<br /><br />other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china. william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. the acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />the cinematography really brings out fifty's hong kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. the ending is a real tear-jerker. some may consider sentimental romances pass'e, but, for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.
