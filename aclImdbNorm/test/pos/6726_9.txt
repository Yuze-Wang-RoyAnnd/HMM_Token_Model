good to see i'm not the only person who remembers this great film. i have very fond memories of this movie - seem to vaguely remember back to when i was about 8 and i'd watch the kids tv shows after school (broom cupboard anyone?). this was the first and last film to scare me - and the images of the boy surrounded by mist on a hill will stay with me forever! like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a definite ability to capture an adults attention. the lovely cornish scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! i'd love to try and find this movie again - see if it still hits home!
