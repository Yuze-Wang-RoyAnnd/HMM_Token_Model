a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict. the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being(or being around) a heroin addict really is. good movie, which will never truly be outdated. excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is preminger's way of showing how bleak a junkie's world can become. worth a look--an education of sorts. the golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in.
