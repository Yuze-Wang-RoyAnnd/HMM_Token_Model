first, i rated this movie 10/10. to me, it's simply one of the best i saw since i was born (i'm 23, but i saw numerous films). the story is cruel, but reality is, too, not ? it went deep into me and stirred my bowels. i saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and i still remember it !<br /><br />second, there is no 'national preference' (this expression is a direct translation from the french) for this movie. i mean it's not because it is a french movie that i put it so high : it has really caught me when i saw it. furthermore, i don't know well marcel carne's filmography, so i don't know if it is or not his best movie, but i know it is not his most famous : hotel du nord, quai des brumes and les enfants du paradis are the most famous.<br /><br />third, the movie's in b&w, but it deals with inter-temporal problems of youth (not acne) like love, friends and studies in a modern way. it could even be remade frame-by-frame with actual young actors, a dolby(tm) sound and special effects (a car crash), it would still be a great film !<br /><br />problem : maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) - and above, of course - for its message to be well understood... did i say it was a great movie ?
