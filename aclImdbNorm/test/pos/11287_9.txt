e. elias merhige's begotten is a one of a kind, surreal depiction of the mankind's treatment of religion. there are a couple of different ways you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: a god disembowels himself, and out of his corpse springs mother earth. mother earth then felates the god's corpse post-mortem, and then impregnates herself with what remains of his seed. following this, she gives birth to a messiah figure who quivers, presumably in infancy, but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth. this all takes place in the first 15-30 minutes, and after that, the rest of the film consists of robed figures dragging the messiah (who is incessantly quivering, or seizing) across a desert landscape. the robed figures pause only to brutalize the messiah, then continue to drag him around.<br /><br />there are a couple of ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your world view. it can easily be interpreted as a bleak nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that christian "deities" can be perceived as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to advance its own selfish goals. or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-christian allegory, in which you view the film as being about how mankind has twisted christ's message around so much that it's original purity and innocence can no longer have relevance in a world where that message and image are inappropriately used to endorse everything from interpersonal violence, to war, to totalitarianism.<br /><br />the visuals of this film are phenomenal, and you will not see anything like it, period. if you can, watch the original vhs release, i recommend it. i'm not sure if the visuals are changed on the dvd, but i have seen clips of this streaming on you tube and the effects are seriously diminished. on the vhs version, merhige achieved total binary contrast. meaning, there basically aren't any mid-tones except for some grain in some of the shots. other than that, this film offers the rare opportunity to see pure white and pure black, and the result is stunning, hallucinatory, and quite unsettling. this film makes film noir look positively washed out and mediocre. the shots fade into each other in a surreal manner that recalls un chien andalou without completely aping it, for an effect that has been called a filmic rorschach test.<br /><br />that being said, the film can certainly try a viewer's patience and commitment. there isn't any dialogue for starters. the only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of crickets chirping, peppered occasionally with the gurgling and death rattles of the dying deities, and an amelodic droning synthesizer texture. personally, i find that the film is best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music like the instrumental nin remixes from the downward spiral era, more abstract noise/experimental music like f*ck buttons and odd nosdam. it also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal. basically any music with extreme textures and/or hypnotic rhythms. that's one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film, it is prime for postmodern re-contextualization, like projecting it during a performance of avant-garde music, or composing avant-garde music to accompany it.<br /><br />once the messiah figure is born, there really isn't much change for the rest of the film, meaning that you are basically sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah figure being drug around the desert and beaten. it looks bleakly beautiful, but there isn't really anything new unfolding. it helps to cement the filmmakers intentions of communicating that for thousands of years now people have been using christ's name and image for personal benefits, but can be tiresome to a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span. basically, if you are looking for a modern horror film with suspense, look elsewhere. if you are looking for a unique film experience, and you aren't particularly fond of mainstream hollywood cinema, this could be your quivering messiah.
