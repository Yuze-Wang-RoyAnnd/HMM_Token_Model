i don't usually comment on films since i am in the movie distribution business, but i have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. the acting is fantastic and the script is even better. there were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more "hollywood". james mcavoy is such an outstanding actor, i could not look away from him if i tried. i was impressed with steven robertson as well. i cannot believe this is his first real film. brenda fricker plays a small role, but as usual, she is outstanding. this is a movie for everyone to see just how lucky we all are. if you like awakenings and mask, you will enjoy this story. you owe it to yourself to check this film out.
