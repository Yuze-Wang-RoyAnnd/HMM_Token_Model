before i start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas.<br /><br />in australian slang "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear), "stubbies" are a brand of australian short, a "stubby" is a small can sized bottle of beer, and a "stubby holder" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer.<br /><br />if you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie, unfortunatley a lot of people on imdb with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is. a lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock/stock and pulp fiction, while it is the same genre, it is a completely different and original style.<br /><br />a lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using heath ledger's characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie, without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill heaths character, this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand.<br /><br />this movie is also reminiscent of lock/stock and reservoir dogs in that it is the director/writers debut feature, and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies, as a matter of fact like lock/stock and reservoir dogs i rate this movie as a 10/10 for a director/writers debut, unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly.<br /><br />this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily.
