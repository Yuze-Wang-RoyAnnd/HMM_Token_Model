i went into this film thinking i wasn't going to like it, but hoping to be surprised, but this, much like the film, ended up being bleak and hopeless. but don't get me wrong, minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion. the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law, kidman and zellweger, even though portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film. the locations are beautiful and minghella has an eye for a good shot.<br /><br />however, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to minghella and his adaptation. the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what i consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film i didn't have the time to emotionally invest, or hadn't recovered from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. overall the "cold mountain" almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film, as all i remember is death, which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters.
