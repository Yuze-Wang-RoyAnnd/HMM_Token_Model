there is, as many reviews have observed, a strong dark streak to this movie. the director it most recalls to me is john landis (yeah, go ahead and howl about what a peasant i am). arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a bleak, gray kind of way, then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touch.<br /><br />the cast is, without exception, above average. thomas gibson, as david, is outstanding as the moody and self-deceptive center around whom the rest of the characters revolve. he talks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. it was difficult to look at him and see greg montgomery, let alone agent hotchner of criminal minds.<br /><br />perhaps not the best scene, but the one i enjoy most, my "rewind scene," is the section where candy is expecting a visitor, and one uninvited person after another shows up at the door. as candy's interpersonal environment swings further and further out of control, david just grows bouncier, perkier, and more enthusiastic, like a gaunt gen-x "tigger."
