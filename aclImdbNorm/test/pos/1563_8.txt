i just saw this on cable. i liked it. it held my interest and the dramatic choices were good. the old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy. the cinematography is not so great, but the shabby video also adds to the sense of realism, so its a trade-off, you know? at times the girl would hit the new england accent to hard. the accent would sort of come and go. anyway, i thought the film was well done overall, though. the storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on, even though things seemed mundane. good job on a low budget. another good suny purchase filmmaker. way to go.
