bridges's drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear powerplant is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late 70s. its not amazing, but its solid, the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon, but douglas and fonda were good too. it was a pretty good screenplay and bridges's direction was solid and suitable. this is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s, but its one of the better ones. a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime.--- imdb rating: 7.2, my rating:, so in simple words, solid but not amazing... thats what this film is, solid but not amazing 8/10
