i never heard of mishima before i watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious, i still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box. at the beginning of the film, we are told about a celebrated japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. as the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of mishima's mind. the stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from mishima's life and appear in black and white. the second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours. there is a different novel staged in each chapter. between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, as mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide. this means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end.<br /><br />i suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and art-house. i respect that, this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line. if on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by philip glass, you will love it. i loved it.<br /><br />
