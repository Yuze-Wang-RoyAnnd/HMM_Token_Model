just watched this and it was amazing. was in serious doubt about renting the dvd or not. so if you are...and like watching other than brainless action-movies...don't hesitate any longer. don't let the dull cover put you off. the script is one of the best ever. inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie. i had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy, and usually i get bored on watching a second movie in one night, but this one really made me wake up and didn't have any boring moments. it also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling.<br /><br />also the acting is great (one of kevin spacey's best roles). the visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well-chosen. if i have to come up with something negative to say about it....well....i can't really find anything......enjoy! 10 out of 10
