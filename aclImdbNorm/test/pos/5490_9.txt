i was watching the perfect storm, and thought about another wolfgang peterson film which is much better--this one. although certainly not based on a true story, in the line of fire is how a movie should be made. it has a terrific story with a great cast. malkovich won a well-deserved oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well. eastwood is good as the tortured secret service and russo is easy on the eyes. if you haven't seen this, definitely rent it or buy it as i did. definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10
