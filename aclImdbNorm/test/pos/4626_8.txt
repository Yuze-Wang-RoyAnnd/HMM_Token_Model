2:37 succeeds admirably at showing us what australian teenagers feel and don't say. these are the stories of real kids and i think we would be naive to think otherwise. the only new thing 2:37 really brings us is an australian point of view. we often watch troubled american children but often fail to link the same problems to our own teens. executed with clever and artful cinematography, i did however (upon immediate recognition of the disappointing final song) find the musical direction lacking in sophistication. i applaud the fabulous casting of this film. these are regular looking aussie kids who invite plenty of sympathy because of this. great performances all round and you can't top gary sweet, this film made me remember why sometimes high school sucked and unless you're squeamish, or you like to leave with warm and fuzzies, go and see 2:37.
