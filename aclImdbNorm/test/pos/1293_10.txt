i saw this episode of masterpiece theatre and immediately came to imdb to look it up. i was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. i would feel morally remiss if i didn't disagree.<br /><br />now, i am an avid fan of masterpiece theatre, but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television, for example, "he knew he was right" was absolutely horrendous. "carrie's war," however, is probably the best i've seen so far. the entire cast does an excellent job, and it held my interest more than any other piece i've seen recently. the character mr. evans is of particular interest, and through subtle images of, for example, an untouched birthday cake or a garnet ring, my opinion of him went from bad to truly good. truly. his ultimate demise, and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold hard man, is what brought out the bittersweet in this story for me.<br /><br />the end is gratifying in every sense but one; that everyone did not get what they deserved, but overall things worked out. i absolutely recommend this to everyone.
