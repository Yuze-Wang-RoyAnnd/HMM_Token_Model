even though this movie starts off with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stranded etc. it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. riddick is somewhat of a bad-ass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship-crew and he gets in. the cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the anti-hero and male protagonist: "riddick." the story in pitch black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. vin diesel acts really well in the role as riddick and even though his character is a hardcore, tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end... why destroy an already perfect reputation? all in all this is a very good movie though not perfect. the story seems very unoriginal at the surface, but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average. it could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up sci-fi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely riddick.
