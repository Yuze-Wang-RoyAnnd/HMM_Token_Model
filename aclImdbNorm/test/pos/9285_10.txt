this program is certainly my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. australia produces very little good programs - most of the tv which i watch (and i live in australia) is from the us and england.<br /><br />the funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is. like when they went past numerous security barriers at the apec summit pretending to be canadian diplomats.<br /><br />the show is made up of pre-filmed stunts, general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes on-stage skits. these all come together to make a fabulous, extremely funny tv show. the segments like "ad road-test" and "message from osama bin ladin" are hilarious. for anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical tv comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch.<br /><br />all the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour.<br /><br />i would rate it 10/10.
