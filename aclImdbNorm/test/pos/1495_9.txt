"mr. bean", starring the legendary rowan atkinson, was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s, and i probably first saw it when i was around ten, shortly after it ended, so i was seeing reruns. i certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. i didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when i finally watched every episode. unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes! <br /><br />mr. bean is a mysterious, self-centred, antisocial, extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his teddy! he is pretty much isolated from society, and life is not easy for him, as he constantly struggles with very simple things! this is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge, and has the mind of a child. he finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes, and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems he faces! not only does he often cause trouble for himself, but sometimes for other people as well, which he often doesn't tend to realize! in other words, mr. bean is a walking disaster! <br /><br />the humour in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. the gags are almost always sight gags, which is mostly what the show is about. while there may be an occasional lacklustre gag, i would say the vast majority of them are funny, often hilarious, (there are so many highlights)! while "mr. bean" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it's still great for many of those who like visual humour, and due to the very limited dialogue, you don't even have to speak fluent english to enjoy the show, which is why it has received such a world-wide reputation! the show ran for a few years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only fourteen were made in total. nonetheless, it is a classic series, and deserves its wide appeal!
