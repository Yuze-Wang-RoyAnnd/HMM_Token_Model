this show is absolutely fantastic. it provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows like the oc and dawsons, but it's a whole lot funnier. it's a show with morals and values, without everything being sugar coated and sanitised (ala 7th heaven.) we don't have sororities or fraternities in australia, and our university system is completely different, so i have no idea how accurately greek life is portrayed. but i don't care! because this show is my new favourite! any writer that can make me love a racist, homophobe confederate flag-waving bible basher must be genius.<br /><br />and cappie is my new pacey. sorry josh jackson, you've been dethroned!
