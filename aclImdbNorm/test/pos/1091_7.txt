nana patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in bombay without a doubt. his recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian. one wonders why he is always not given his accolades during awards season.<br /><br />"shakti-the power" was one of his flicks that was an utter disapointment along with kohram (a missed oppurtunity to create screen magic with amitabh bachchan).<br /><br />but patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey. ridding the streets of bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters, patekars character takes control of the screen (and the viewers attention) and never lets go. the editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story.<br /><br />along the same lines as the modern day cult classic "company", the movie is well acted, directed and should have a long shelf life on dvd.<br /><br />the final ten minutes that see nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of hindi cinema classics. won't be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick.
