i first saw this movie back in 1994 or '95 during my freshman year in high school when it was on lifetime. after i first saw it, i thought it was wonderful. sure, it may not have run longer, but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion (regardless of what anyone else may think). cynthia gibb was great at portraying karen, and mitchell anderson was okay as richard. louise fletcher (yes, who played nurse ratched in 1975's "one flew over the cuckoo's nest") was fine as well, but i found her version of agnes (karen and richard's mother) to be a little bit of a control freak. i am an extremely huge fan of the carpenters, and i believe that karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. it really saddens me about the fact that she is gone and had left this earth too soon, but thanks to the never ending popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will live on. anyway, back on track to this movie, it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people (fans and non-fans of the carpenters) as to what caused karen to end up getting this problem with her health. was it the media that was responsible or was it just karen's decision? i would not believe that it was her decision. it could have been the media from one article that was printed out about her somewhere in '70, when their hit "close to you" came out (from what was shown in the film). there are some other moments in the movie as well. richard's struggle with drugs, and karen's brief marriage. i did not hear about her loss in february of 1983, as i was not yet into watching the news; i had found out years later. i don't know if there will be another movie about the carpenters or karen made in the future, but until then, this movie will do fine. i will say this though: if karen had disregarded the false details of that article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling her "chubby" (which must have been quite an insult), she would still be here on this earth today. i know that she is in heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice. god bless you, karen!!
