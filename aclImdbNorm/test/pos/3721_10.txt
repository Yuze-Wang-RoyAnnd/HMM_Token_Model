if you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. but if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. <br /><br />basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. in this fight they lost the ability to speak... i don't want to write more to not spoil the movie for you, but trust me if you like sf-authors like lem or capec or even some from orson scott card you will love this movie.
