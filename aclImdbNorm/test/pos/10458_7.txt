the movie begins almost achingly slowly, a "romance" (yawn) that seems to ramble off course (all part of the plan...) then, roughly one hour into this solemn movie is the feast. it's worth paying attention to that first hour. the feast is still solemn, but humorous. suddenly, the withdrawn and slightly petty characters come to life, and everyone (you and the characters) leave feeling enriched by the experience.<br /><br />women will love this. christians of all sorts will enjoy the profound faith demonstrated by the characters. not my favorite movie of all time - no dinosaurs or laser beams, after all - but definitely a movie i am happy to have seen. not to be missed.<br /><br />jim
