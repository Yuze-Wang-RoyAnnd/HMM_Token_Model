i collect films on super-8, and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on e-bay. it looks like at least for the moment, this is the only way to see this film in a country having ntsc video. i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times, but never region 1. <br /><br />i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it. it's a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world. the photography and music were wonderful, and i really felt empathy for some of the characters.<br /><br />i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching "when the north wind blows" tonight! <br /><br />long live avakum!!
