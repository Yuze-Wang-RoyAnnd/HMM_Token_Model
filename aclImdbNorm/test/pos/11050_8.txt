i'd read all the negative reviews for "anna christie". you know, the gripes about the static camera, out-dated acting and wordiness of the screenplay. but when i viewed it yesterday i found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable. yep, clarence brown's camera remains stationary for the most part, and i'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light. yep, there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. it's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. but... then there's garbo, marie dressler, george f. marion and charles bickford, all proving that great acting is timeless.<br /><br />i believe "anna christie" is still one of garbo's most iconic performances. and it's a wonderful performance from the divine one, in a role that is really quite atypical for her. yes, we've seen garbo weary and almost beaten, yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey. garbo played so many (delightful) costume roles, that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. she's not weighed down by heavy dresses or make-up. this performance seems quite raw from garbo.<br /><br />the plot, from the o'neill play, follows weary swedish ex-prostitute anna, and her reunion with her boozy, seaman father. anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty, as she tells drunken, slovenly marthy (dressler)in a bar. she finds solace in a life at sea, and romance with a rough-hewn, but good-hearted, fisherman (charles bickford). but her past threatens to ruin it all.<br /><br />charles bickford is overlooked in garbo's long line of (largely inferior) leading men. he's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence. the pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another. dressler can never be accused of underplaying, and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks, but she's terrific and convincing in her role, never annoying as in the dreadful "dinner at eight". i've never really heard of george f. marion before, but he was wonderful as garbo's father.<br /><br />this is pre-code, and rather gritty and dark by mgm's standards. i really enjoyed it, and while it may creak in some places, it's still wonderful.
