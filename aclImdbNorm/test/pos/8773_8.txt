i am a massive hitchcock fan, ever since seeing "rear window" on television. "saboteur" is not hitchcock's best for me though, it is very good but not a masterpiece. it does have its faults, some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete. but hitchcock's direction is superb, and the performances weren't that bad. while robert cummings and priscilla lane both do a good enough job, otto kruger and norman lloyd come very close to stealing the show. the story is good, about a wronged man on the run, very similar themes used in "39 steps" and "north by northwest", and cleverly provides some much needed escapism. the music score was absolutely outstanding; the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and i liked the digs at tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto and beethoven's 5th symphony. the cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. namely the statue of liberty climax, but the circus troupe encounter and the radio music city hall shoot-out is also on the money. overall, not hitchcock's best, but definitely worth the look. 8/10 bethany cox
