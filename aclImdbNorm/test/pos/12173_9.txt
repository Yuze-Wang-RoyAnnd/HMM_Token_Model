great movie. i was laughing all time through. why? well, i am from austria, i can get along with the german (bavarian) kind of humor. so i guess this movie makes only sense watching when you are german native speaker. stefan and erkan both are talking in a new kind of turkish-german accent, which became really popular in our countries (ger & aut). but of course they are very stupid. as in every comedy your personal humor will decide, whether thumb up or down.
