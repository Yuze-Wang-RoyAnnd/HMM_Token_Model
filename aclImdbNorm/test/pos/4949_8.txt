iron eagle may not be the most believable film plot-wise, but the characters are well written and very well acted. if you cannot believe the characters, the film is a flop.<br /><br />i believe the photography, especially the aerial photography is superb. i believe it is far superior to top gun to which it is endlessly compared. it is one of the best pieces of aerial photography i have seen. the soundtrack by basil paledouros (forgive the spelling)is great, and juxtaposes well with the rock tunes. i wish that portion of the soundtrack were available.<br /><br />jason gedrick does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a rush and and the realities of life, death, and responsibilities. lou gossett is fab as chappy, both hard-bitten and yet human as he recalls pilot deaths.<br /><br />there are lots of movies out there that you watch once and don't care to watch again. then there are those movies that get you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again! iron eagle is that kind of movie!
