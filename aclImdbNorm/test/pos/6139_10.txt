william m. thackeray once said "a good laugh is sunshine in the house." when i watched take away, i must say that the sun did shine in my house. this film was superb, the opening was very cleverly done, the story held together well, in a nutshell two fish'n chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a david and goliath struggle against a fast food chain which builds a restaurant on their street. the ending was hilarious even though i have found many who disagree with me on that one.<br /><br />the film was though very discreetly, portraying contemporary australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the collision or culture clash if you will between the traditional anglo australian and italo australian stereotypes, and how they found a sort of "unity though adversity", very nice.<br /><br />i found vince colosimo's performance as "tony stilano" an italo-australian fish 'n chip shop owner in his thirties to be first-class, his acting was very genuine and convincing, through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence, or i should say the soul of the italian australian stereotype, which in reality is not too italian but not too australian either, colosimo found that balance, breathed into its lungs and gave it life.<br /><br />the cinematography could have been better, more shots of the local area would've been nice, from what i can see it was in melbourne, but where in melbourne? to me it looks like somewhere between ivanhoe to bullen, though i am not 100% sure on that one.<br /><br />i don't know why so many people are comparing this film to "the castle" though they have similar themes running through them, take away stands in a league of its own.<br /><br />i think the film was excellent with a capital "e" it has everything, it's funny, the jokes are great, it deals with contemporary issues facing australian society, the story holds well, i loved it! i highly recommend it.
