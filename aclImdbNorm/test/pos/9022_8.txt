i love this movie. i just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it. this movie is so funny. there are two times that i was laughing so hard my sides hurt. i didn't expect to watch a movie so funny; i really only wanted to see it because laura fraser is in it. i first saw her in titus which is an awesome movie as well.<br /><br />like others reviewers have said, too many people are expecting a deep moving film. you are not going to get it. what you will get is humor, eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them. you can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex.<br /><br />a hilarious sequence involves justine first seeing herself as a naked man. i was cracking up.<br /><br />i swear, this movie is the most imaginative teen film that i have ever seen and it is now my favorite.<br /><br />just remember why movies were originally created; as entertainment not philosophy in motion. remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality.
