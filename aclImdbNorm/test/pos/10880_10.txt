this is my favorite game for the nintendo 64 platform. i've played many different first-person shooters, and i've never really liked any of them much, but this game has a certain something that i can't put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun. maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game. maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. maybe it's the suave character of james bond. whatever it is, this game never seems to get old no matter how many times i've played it.
