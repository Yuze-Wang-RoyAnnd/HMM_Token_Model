i've commented once on this chucky great, but i had to do it again to say some things about the film, when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because i cherish chucky. the other horror villains are referenced with great coolness!!! and the gore was shockingly great! the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful! that was a great gore scene!!!!! and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s*%@ my pants. the idea of having the seed of chucky was very, very bizarre and shocking! when i left the theater i just loved it and i could'nt believe it was real. the bizarre and different qualities of this child's play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the child's play series. it just had that intensely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell. a sure ***** out of *****. here's how i rank the series : 1,4,2,3. i loved it but not quite as much as tom holland's original child's play classic. i can't wait for seed of chucky! bring it on!
