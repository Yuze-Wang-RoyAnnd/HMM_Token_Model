the strong points in the film were clear for the beginning and middle part of the film. it showed how a very violent, reactive authority might react to resistance. filmed in the fashion of a documentary, the director captures what would have happened if the united states enacted martial law. volunteering for "punishment park," a training ground for cops where you're bullied and harassed, would offer you an out to this dire scenario. it switches between the court trials for those facing accusations, those who are in the park escaping police attention, the training of officers preparing to handle these prisoners, the judges in their leisure time, among many other things. it was a very strong, deeply moving film.<br /><br />the only fault i had with this was its realism. officers are often seen holding their pistols like they were seven years old with a plastic toy (i.e. a 90 degree bent elbow when pointing a gun in someone's face, or the way one cop just makes it look like it's hard to kick someone when they're down, etc., etc..). it starts out as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs. by the end of the film, the viewer is slowly reminded again and again of the prejudices of the director and the producers. the antagonist characters in the story start out as genuine, real human beings and then slowly progress into "stereotypical, objectifiable forces of evil" by the very end. the mistakes they make are stupid, the force they demonstrate is unreal and unlike the way real police act, the judges during this court hearing are shown making stupid and unreal mistakes, among many other things.<br /><br />the realness of the movie started to fall apart when it became evident that this was just another blank-check attempt to make government look bad. and that's coming from an anarchist. the scenes at the end started to get hokey, unreal, and a thousand times over-dramatic. still, for the earlier part of it, it promises some very moving storyline.
