hehehe. this was one of the best funny road movies ever! i laughed so i fell out of the chair. with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. harald zwart is the producer, known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at mccool's.<br /><br />it is about norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in soccer in germany 2006. and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. it was hilarious. i couldn't stop laughing. i haven't had so much fun in ages. rumors say it will come a number two, but i do not know. it will be hard beating this one. <br /><br />recommended to everyone! it is a must see film. i was suppose to see it at the cinema, but i had work at the times it where shown. and been trying to rent it for a month, but all the time rented out. got it today on dvd. well worth it.
