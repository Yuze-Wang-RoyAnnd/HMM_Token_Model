like the first one,the team of jackass are back to try to kill themselves with whatever manner they see fit.either,it's fitting yourself in a tractor tyre and rolling down a slope.or getting yourself deliberately smashed by a bull.or something even worse.<br /><br />the first one was crazy,and that's how you can describe it.it was also really hard laughing film.but this one is completely nuts.it's got even more dangerous stunts,and even harder laughs.so,i think watching dumb idiots getting themselves killed is gonna be the funniest thing this week.<br /><br />so,before borat comes out,i shall laugh my a** out.
