excellence seems to come rare in hollwood today. many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. and in 'everything is illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.<br /><br />the film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. from the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. and also, the cast is introduced perfectly. for elijah wood's character, jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand. and for the character entitled alex, it is easy to see his life in his perspective - the true ukrainian rock star. with the cast illuminated at first, the story slowly eases into our minds as jonathon decides to venture to ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather, thus the entire family. and from there, the story movies slowly, yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear-dripping drama and laugh-out-loud humor included in scene-by-scene, every scene.<br /><br />although the movie itself is rather awarding, there are several complaints from other sources commenting about liev schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of the jonathon safron foer novel. personally, i have never read the novel. but any movie, especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book, but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. just because it may be far-fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must-see - it still is.<br /><br />throughout the film, new information inundates the audience's mind very slowly. some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the second half of the movie refocuses its entire topic and reason of travel through ukraine onto something different, yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film. the film does however leave you on a satisfied note - yet to the weak-hearted souls, a tear may be dropped. and throughout the film. to the saneful people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from alex and john's fun and ongoing conversations.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to several different types of people: to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama-comedy, for those who have an interest in family connections, and to those whom have an interest in holocaustic subjects. and to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. and for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film, you are wrong; this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences. and to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this film, but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book.<br /><br />all in all, 'everything is illuminated' is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones' hearts.
