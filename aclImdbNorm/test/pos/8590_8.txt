the story of how the (communist) leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of mobutu. a story of struggle and injustice, of hope and the search of freedom. the story could be the one of any african country. a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty. if you have to see only one foreign film this year, see this one.
