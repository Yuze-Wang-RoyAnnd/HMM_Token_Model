just lovely. it is long. no climax. don't wait for anything to happen. great for a rainy day. about a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the greek isles. i saw this in my teens and still love it 20+ years later. i have been unable to find it in video stores however. molly ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place. there are no phones, no tv, boredom, which when hit with quietness like that, the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. and each character does so. susan sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with john cassavetes' character, but he is unable to, well, you know. gina rowlands, is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage. he is demanding and frustrating to everyone. there is another character in the movie, a greek who talks to molly ringwald inappropriately about sex, but things that she is curious about. but he is irritating and horny and i didn't like this character. the locale of the film is what makes this film so so good. it wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else. i recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
