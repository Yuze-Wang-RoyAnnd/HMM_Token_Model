ok, i got the dvd set last week and i am finally getting around to posting my reviews, but i sure liked this sequel in many ways.<br /><br />zombie bloodbath 2: rage of the undead. ok. this one movies at a fast clip, has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style. i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that i have bought. most of the time, i get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas. even a movie like bone sickness that i like, has incredible stretches of dull. not this movie. it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. although i wouldn't say i liked it better than the first film, i will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films. this one has better gore, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and a few returning actors (although their roles are different) mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell. the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film. some of it works and some of it doesn't, but i have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to do a larger version of the first film. there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage, just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life. so i say kudos to mr. sheets for trying to do something different with this one. i give this film two bloody thumbs up!
