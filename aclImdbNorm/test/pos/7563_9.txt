what a great movie!! it's a touching story about four high-school friends who grow up in the 1960s. throughout the decade, the friends are somewhat separated, but they mnnage to see each other occasionally. there are many tragedies, but there are also a lot of happy moments that make you laugh and smile. it's a heart-filled tale of life, love and friendship. definitely a must see for drama fans.
