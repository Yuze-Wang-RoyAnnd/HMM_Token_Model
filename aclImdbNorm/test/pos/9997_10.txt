wow, here is another great golf movie. that's at least three in the past few years that i've really enjoyed, that were well-done, beautifully-filmed and inspirational. the other two were "bobby jones: stroke of genius" and "the legend of bagger vance."<br /><br />this is a true underdog story, if there ever was one. to have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the united states open golf tournament is an unheard-of feat. i believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished. how much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect, i don't know. i do know that i plan on reading the book, and i know that in real-life, francis ouimet had a three-stroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go, unlike what we saw in the film.<br /><br />whatever. francis ouimet's victory over golf legends harry vardon and ted ray is fact. it is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. it isn't something just for golf fans; this is a fun movie. kudso to actor-turned-director bill paxton for an outstanding job.<br /><br />yes, a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him. it's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. the movie also deals with vardon's demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitist's sport, which it was at the time for both europeans and americans.<br /><br />shia labeouf is winsome as ouimet as is steven dillane as vardon. for those who don't know, vardon was like the tiger woods of his day, maybe even more unbeatable. in the film, vardon is pictured as a warm, nice guy; a genuine human being. the other major competitor, ray (stephen marcus) is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy. <br /><br />the fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who winds up being ouimet's caddie in the open. he (josh flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie.<br /><br />if all of this - a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole - were not true, you would think, "oh, man, this is so hokey. who could believe this?" that's what makes this true-life story fun to see finally captured on film. as with another sports film of 2005 - "cinderella man" - here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards. i guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers.
