i would like to know if "the outsiders" (australian tv series) will ever be released on dvd sometime in the future? and is the music (title theme) available on cd?<br /><br />there was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total.<br /><br />the young german actor in the series was also in a german tv series called "black forest clinic" which aired here in the uk with english dialogue superimposed with the lip-sync. <br /><br />i look forward to hearing any comments from tv industry personnel on the above questions, thank you in advance.
