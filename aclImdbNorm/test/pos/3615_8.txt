at first i didn't think i would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. i love music and i was impressed with how well cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. my son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how corelli won the girls heart. the acting and the story were both well done and well directed. at first corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you. the twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the germans. i would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. i also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again.
