that's certainly not the best film ever. but that's certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind. so the one who loves sadness and depression, and scary fairy-tales at night, and wolves and real madness - welcome! if you find a copy, of course:) as for me, i could stand it only once... but since that the wolves, and saint-lucy, and children's drawings, and a headless christ live in my nightmares.
