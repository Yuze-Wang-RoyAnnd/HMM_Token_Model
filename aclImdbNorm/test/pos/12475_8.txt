ruthless mercenary bruno rivera (paul naschy in peak nasty form) betrays his pregnant partner/girlfriend meiko (well played by eiko nagashima) in order to have exclusive dibs on a fortune in stolen diamonds. but meiko manages to seriously wound bruno before he gets away. bruno winds up in the swanky chalet of kindly rich doctor don simon (a fine performance by lautaro murua). he also attracts the attention of simon's two hottie daughters: the fiery monica (luscious silvia aguiler) and the sweet alicia (nicely essayed by the lovely azucena hernandez). however, bruno soon realizes that something is very amiss about the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can. meanwhile, the bitter meiko tries to find bruno so she can exact her revenge on him. naschy, who wrote and directed as well as stars, concocts one of his strangest, most twisted and perverse horror vehicles ever with this little seen oddity. the offbeat plot and mysterious atmosphere become more weird and unnerving as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a genuinely startling surprise downbeat ending. this film further benefits from occasional moments of graphic gore (watch out for the memorable sequence with one poor guy being devoured alive by vicious flesh-eating pigs!), alejandro ulloa's slick cinematography, and a decent sprinkling of nudity and soft-core sex. good supporting turns by roxana dupre as sassy maid raquel, pepe ruiz as amorous playboy don serafin, and julia saly as the deranged teresa. a pleasingly grim and worthwhile shocker.
