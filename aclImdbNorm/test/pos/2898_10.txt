how do these guys keep going? they're about 50 years old each, and act as if they're only 30. they play 3 hours of music at every concert, and barely break a sweat. this dvd is their first concert in rio, brazil. although the people don't speak english, they try to memorize the words to the most famous rush songs, and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends.<br /><br />from tom sawyer to the spirit of radio, this concert dvd will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you've listened to when you were young. this is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). i went to their scranton pa concert, and this was just as good, although in pa they didn't play freewill, so i was upset.<br /><br />they have freewill, they have the trees, they have yyz, the pass, driven, dreamline, red sector a, limelight, roll the bones, 2112, and much more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. if you never go to a rush concert, then at least buy this dvd.
