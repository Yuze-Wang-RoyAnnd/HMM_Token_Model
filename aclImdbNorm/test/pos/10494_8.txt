i must admit, when i first began watching this film i had no clue what was going on. so the beginning was a bit confusing for me. however, that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie. the characters reveal themselves to be more complex than they may first appear, and that is what makes this a memorable film. at first i heard this was a real "hollywood" movie. although it obviously lacks the stereotypical "guns and fists" element, the convincing performances of talented actors such as martin sheen and sam neill more than make up for it. i'd rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day.
