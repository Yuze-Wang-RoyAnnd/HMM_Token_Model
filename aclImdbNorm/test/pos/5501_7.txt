written by brilliant monkees' tv writers gerald gardner and dee caruso,which way to the front was the last of the "jerry lewis" movies until "hardly working" almost a decade later. jerry's comedy is evidently an acquired taste, and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he helms as producer/director--but even in the dreariest of his films, there are always moments of brilliance.<br /><br />which way manages to be amusing,entertaining and yes,quite funny. it is somewhat unlike any of the typical lewis films.the pace is very upbeat and ther are lots of excellent supporting players--a kind of jerry does hogans heroes.the whole thing looks kind of like an unsold tv pilot and you will either love it or hate it---but hopefully you vill laugh
