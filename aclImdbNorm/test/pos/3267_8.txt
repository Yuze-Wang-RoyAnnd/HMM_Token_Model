jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of sydney, australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old jimmy, (heath ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. the gangsters, (led by bryan brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. that's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. but this mob tickle your funny bone as well. a clever structured script by jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.
