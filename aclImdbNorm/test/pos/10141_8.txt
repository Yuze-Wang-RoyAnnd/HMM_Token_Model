certainly this film has the ring of truth about it, as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a marine base. it deals with the attempted cover-up by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend, a marine captain. the man and woman had been lovers, but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married. he continued to stalk her, going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time. finally he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife, and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed. the civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense, but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder. the major, you see, was a decorated hero from vietnam, and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base. the captain, too, had made some enemies in her motor pool command, rejecting some male advances in a very butch style.<br /><br />there is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama, which the very capable cast gets across nicely. the director and editor, however, seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view. you're lucky if you know where you're at most of the time. bear with them, though; it's a worthwhile story as the captain's court martial trial unfolds, and it seems every man's hand is against her, even her attorney at times. <br /><br />the verdict? well, after all, this is rather a suspense story, so you'll have to see for yourself. there is a kind of "pacifist" message folded into the film, but forget about that. sure, "war is hell", but sometimes it can't be avoided. we'll need those marines then, even if they aren't always the best champions of fair play internally. as kipling says in his poem "tommy atkins":<br /><br />"it's tommy this and tommy that, and tommy wait outside. but, it's room for mr. atkins, when the troopship's on the tide."
