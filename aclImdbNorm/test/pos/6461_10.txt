this is a powerful film which seems to have never re-arisen after the joe mccarthy censorship period. it influenced me as a jewish teen-ager who had friends of various colors and whose father's family had suffered under the fascist regimes in europe during the second quarter of the twentieth century. unlike the later rip-off, "on the waterfront" which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the enforced hollywood political correctness of the time, it told its story direct and with respect for the characters and for the reality it fictionally reflected. it was an antidote to "gone with the wind", "birth of a nation", "triumph of the will" and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. i would place it alongside the recent german film (also virtually hidden in the us), "rosenstrasse."<br /><br />i remember that the tv version, also black and white in format as well as story, was blacked out by some stations because the black hero's wife appeared white. as a young civil rights worker, it produced a conflict for me because on the one hand i was opposed to smoking cigarettes and on the other opposed the boycott in georgia of a sponsor of the tv show, a major tobacco company (i no longer remember which one -- does anyone else?).<br /><br />i would love to find a cd of either the film or the tv show to let my sons see something that informed my opposition to racism universally (as opposed to only fighting racism against jews) and recognition of the inherent connection between racism and militarism.
