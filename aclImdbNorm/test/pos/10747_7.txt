project a ii is a classic jackie chan movie with all the kung fu, crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect. not as good as the prequel but still it is a great movie if you just want something fun to watch. the story is simple, jackie chan versus the evil men. so if you want a movie that you don't have to be a braniac to understand, i would suggest this one.
