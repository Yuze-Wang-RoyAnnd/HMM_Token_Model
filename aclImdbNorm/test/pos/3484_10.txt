this movie felt so real. i actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both rory and michael. i have duchene's muscular dystrophy like rory so what you see here is exactly what i've actually felt myself. some won't believe there are disabled people like rory, full of anger and rebellion. i know they exist because i'm one of them.<br /><br />the story is great. for a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. i was never bored, maybe partly because i was seeing stuff that is close to my heart. but i think most people, with intelligence, will be glued to the screen and care about the characters. the acting is phenomenal! james mcavoy is perfect as rory o'shea, who has duchene's muscular dystrophy. he steven robertson deserves an award for his portrayal as michael connolly, who has cerebral palsy.<br /><br />michael's love isn't returned by a girl and rory helps him come to terms with it. i've felt this many times and the question is "doesn't she love me because i'm just not the one or because my disability turned her off?" no matter what the girl says, we will always be skeptical as to the truth. it's just natural and it hurts either way.<br /><br />a few parts made me cry a little because it is sad and i have to face the issues myself. people without a terminal disability just cannot begin to fathom how it can feel. this is a must-see film for everyone. disabled people are everywhere and greatly misunderstood. this film brings a little light on some of the facts of life, which are so taken for granted by the able-bodied. we want to be just like you - to live on our own terms, to go out, to get drunk, to be loved. on the outside, we can't do much but on the inside, we're dancing!
