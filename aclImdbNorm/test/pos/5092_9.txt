30 years after the original film, "goodbye, mr. chips" was made over as a musical. peter o'toole and petula clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher, chippington, who is referred to as chips by his beloved wife.<br /><br />o'toole was excellent here and received another oscar nomination. you have to wonder what peter o'toole has to do to win an oscar. he has lost the coveted award 8 times now. you also have to wonder that he lost in 1969 to john wayne for "true grit," which was really a testament to mr. wayne's long career and popularity. this year was also marked by great performances by richard burton, "anne of the thousand days," as well as dustin hoffman and jon voight for "midnight cowboy."<br /><br />surprised to see petula clarke cast as mrs. chippington. however, as this was a musical, a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well.<br /><br />who can forget the scene when chips carries on in the class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing. he never got to tell her the wonderful news of his pending promotion.<br /><br />the beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience.
