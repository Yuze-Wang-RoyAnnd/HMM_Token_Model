this is a decent movie. although little bit short in time for me, it packs a lot of action, grit, commonsense and emotions in that time frame. matt dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie. the emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie. it is not typical fancy expensive hollywood cgi action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price. my evening was great because of this movie. this movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting, story and directing. i would recommend this movie. the character development of the characters were good and makes you believe that were are actually seeing a real event taking place. because this movie i believe was made with cheaper budget, the acting and quality were much higher.
