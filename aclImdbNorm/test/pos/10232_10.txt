why didn't critics like this movie?? i don't get it. this is easily my favorite clive barker effort. "hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and, lets face it, "lord of illusions" doesn't move at all!!! i have loved barker's writing for years, especially his "books of blood". terrifically entertaining. he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king. he freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements. i love love love love it. i also realize , however, that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. and fantasy just isn't my bag. puts me right to sleep. always has. i also think barker works best with short stories. his novels tend to wander a bit. that was my experience when trying to read "the damnation game". it started out well. then 100 pages in i thought "where is this going?" because it wasn't going anywhere.<br /><br />i read "cabal" (the book nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. i especially like the elaboration on decker's character. the way the mask talked to him and controlled him. i like the way barker simply presents it. black and white. there it is. he gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable. when asked why decker kills he says (simply) "because i like it". probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point.<br /><br />but i actually liked the film nightbreed better than cabal. i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films. adore it. i think it is just beautiful. lord of illusions had some of this as well. some of the drawings in the beginning, during the nightbreed credit sequence. it's like an entire vocabulary barker dreamed up just for the nightbreed world. i'd be curious to know how much was purely his design. i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artist.<br /><br />nightbreed is also (i think) barker's most entertaining film. it moves very quickly. well edited. it doesn't drag like lord of illusions does a little bit. very quick. everything in it is just perfect. it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff. that mask is frightening. i'd be curious to know if barker designed that as well. it's not just a hokey jason or "scream"-type mask. something about it is really disturbing.<br /><br />anyway, this is a great flick. definitely check it out if you haven't seen it. highly recommended. one of my favorite horror films of all time. in my opinion clive barker's best. it is scary and violent though, be warned
