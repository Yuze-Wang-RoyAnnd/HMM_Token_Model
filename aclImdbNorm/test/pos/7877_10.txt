oh man , this movie is amazing, it's very good it's a story about a man who isn't so accepting of black people, he sits at a bar drinks on his night out and he rants about hippies who are anti-war , and how blacks and hippies don't deserve to get any welfare checks. this movie is very realistic ,because it portrays a guy "joe" who represented a lot of guys back then, and now too. the story goes like this.... joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich guy who just accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend. and this rich goes to the bar to rethink what he just did, and while he's doing that, "joe" is in the bar ranting about hippies and people who are against the war. the rich guy accidentally tells joe that he killed a hippie ; and obviously joe applauds the rich guy, cause joe hates hippies, amazing movie watch it to see what happens next. i liked this movie , because it was reminiscent of those days in the early 70's, i liked the way movies were shot back then in those days, very good stuff , it's not like today's movies. basically the movie gives you an inner look into the mind of the lead character "joe" . i like the theme of the movie ....... about the working man , who's busting his ass trying to make a living
