i don't think i've yet seen a movie in my whole lifetime about a high school kid creating his own college, just to impress his parents. nowadays, movies are either remakes or sequels, or plots that have been used in many different films. this one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only lightens the deal. with this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. now i've seen better, but upon going into the theater i was thinking another drug/beer/frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in (aka an "american pie" flick) but i was surprised. to sum it up, i enjoyed the film and the next time your shuffling through the paper for movies, look for show times to "accepted". if you want to laugh out loud, that is.
