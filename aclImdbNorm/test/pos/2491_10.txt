to think this film was made the year i was born. to think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of "homeland security". to think this movie was intentionally banned from the american public. punishment park addresses the political divide in the united states better than any movie i've ever seen. had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? a movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. it shakes you up and forces you to take sides. it makes you face the issue: are you for the people's right of dissent in a time of war, or for the constitution being compromised in the name of "national security"? the protagonists are forced by the government to race to the american flag in a game that undermines the very ideals the flag stands for. the acting is totally convincing. so much so, i can't see any acting going on here at all. if this is a scripted documentary, it's more convincing than any reality show on television today. punishment park is possibly the most important film ever made. it really makes you think.
