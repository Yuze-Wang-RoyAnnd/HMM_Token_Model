people watch movies for a variety of different reasons. this movie didn't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. actually reality doesn't have much of these either. at least not in my life. <br /><br />this is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since i'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain.<br /><br />so watch this movie for the characters. it is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. <br /><br />within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael hayden's life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie. excellent acting, very believable. <br /><br />henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his 'harvey' and kiefer's 'mickey' enhances the oppositeness of their characters.<br /><br />i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, 'mrs ramsay', i'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!!<br /><br />there's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them.
