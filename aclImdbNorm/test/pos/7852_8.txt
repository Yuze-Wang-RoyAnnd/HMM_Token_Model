this is a good movie, i won't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that. however, i disagree with the statement that this is eastwood's best work. that is just not a very defendable position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in. i would like to note that i find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, pattye mattick and peggy drier, never again appeared in another film or television show, in spite of giving good performances. my curiosity has me wondering what happened to these two actresses?
