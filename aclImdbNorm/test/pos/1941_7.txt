i think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it very interesting to me. it is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on the simpsons. layne is jimbo, john is kearney, and tony is dolph. there is even an episode of the simpsons where jimbo uses the line "i poked her with a stick."<br /><br />the jimbo-layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. kearney has the shaved head, unlike john, but is the big, dumb one. the tony-dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long, parted haircut and even the second-tier status.
