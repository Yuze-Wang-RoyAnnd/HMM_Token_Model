when you think of brilliant australian comedy you don't think of skit shows (although i'm quite partial to a bit of 80's and 90's full frontal) or even sitcoms - you think of satire! something that we australians really know how to do well. (eg: front line, the micallef program) we know how to take the pi$$, and the chaser's war on everything, is a classic example of how to do it, and how to do it really well. <br /><br />i've been a huge fan of chris taylor and craig reucassel for a long time. i remember listening to them on triple j's afternoon show. they were, and remain, two of the funniest comedians around.<br /><br />although i was sad when they left triple j, i was excited to find out what they were investing so much time in that made them have to leave. (they were doing cnnnn and triple j at the same time, so i figured this was something much bigger) and what an amazingly hilarious show chaser is. biting political and social satire at it's best.<br /><br />i'm also pleased to say that it has recently received a much better time slot than friday nights and has been moved to wednesday nights right after spicks and specks. thank you abc!! finally i don't have to tape it! :)
