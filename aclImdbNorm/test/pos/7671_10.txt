i found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era. the cast was very exceptional and most entertaining to all that saw it.i would like for my younger generation to have seen this movie,but i haven't been able to find or see the movie in the past.my first viewing was back in the early sixties and i have been looking for it every since.the movie showed me potential of how far we come go to become a gifted at a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants. <br /><br />porky and bess showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as i saw it in the time where i needed good solid male role models. the singing and acting had me skipping for days, playing the part of different characters in this excellent movie.
