i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing "female trouble" on ifc. i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it. then, i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set. the movie is about babs johnson "the filthiest person alive" who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother,and her deranged son "crackers". in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens, drag-queens, people eating feces, torture, and all other sorts of random humiliation. the film has a soundtrack from 60's rock and roll artists. the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring. i found "female trouble" a little more fun. rated nc-17 for explicit sex, violence, and disturbing images. enjoy.
