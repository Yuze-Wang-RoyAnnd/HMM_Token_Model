the kite runner is one of those modern epics that one is occasionally graced with. spanning two continents, multiple family generations, and many decades, this film touches on a myriad of items including friendship, love, loss, and, ultimately, redemption.<br /><br />it's prime mover is young amir (zekeria ebrahimi), a native afghan boy who often plays with the hired help; mainly young hassan (ahmad khan mahmoodzada), a hazara boy who's family is supposedly inferior to the ruling afghans. but the two form a bond of friendship based on education (amir teaches hassan to read), closeness in amir's house, and, of course, kite flying.<br /><br />but bad times are on the way for the city of kabul. the communists are invading and amir and hassan have separated due to an impossibly brutal act of prejudice by an afghan boy against hassan. the two may never see each other again.<br /><br />amir's father races to get himself and his son out of afghanistan, eventually finding their way to america. here the two set up a gas station and live hand to mouth by selling at niche markets. and as amir's father gradually becomes ill, a new revelation will strike to the heart of amir; one that he cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved kabul.<br /><br />a study of friendship, war, and reconciliation, the kite runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema. the story is never inappropriately spoken in english whenever we're in a foreign country, and only broken english whenever we're in america. this was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism.<br /><br />the acting was on-par with the best you'll see, too. particular note must be made of homayoun ershadi who plays baba, amir's ailing father and strong patriarch. also lead khalid abdalla as the older amir is played well, especially when returning to kabul to find it in ruin; quite the contrast from when he'd left.<br /><br />the cinematography of afghanistan during amir's escape and ultimate return are nothing short of breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks that will cause your mouth to slacken (i'm not sure exactly which mountain range they used in the film, but wherever it was i want to go there and film it myself!) but it isn't the cinematography nor the acting of one or two people that makes this film a success. it is a simple story told very well that makes it worth any movie watchers' while. highly recommended.
