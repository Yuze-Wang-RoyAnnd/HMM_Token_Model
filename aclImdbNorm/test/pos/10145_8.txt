this is another enjoyable and entertaining hitchcock film. james stewart and doris day are incredible in this movie. bernard herrmann appears as himself near the climax.<br /><br />the scenery and locations are great, except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake, which doesn't make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots. i've heard that hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes.<br /><br />the reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. i think this is a better than average hitchcock movie. very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end.<br /><br />i rated this movie 8 out of 10.<br /><br />
