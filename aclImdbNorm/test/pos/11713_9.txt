in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included. if you don't like burt you may still like this. if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time! being from atlanta it does hit home but it's also nice to see a cop/action/drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city, chicago, miami, or la. the film is funny at points with & good plot & good performances from a great supporting cast (every character is real & the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out)a nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half & it has some good old fashion shootouts & fistfights (no cgi thank god real action!)<br /><br />if clint eastwood did his best impression of a burt reynolds movie with "every which way but loose" & "any which way you can" then burt responded with his best clint type flick with this, & it comes off great!
