this film is a knockout, fires on the plain referred to is, (the burning off at the end of harvest time) a happy memory for tamura, he relives this in his mind many time's,and at the end of this bleak film, like a man dying of thirst, he believe's he is home and this last illusion is all he has left. billy wilder's the big carnival (ace in the hole) is the only film (that comes to mind)that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by kon ichikawa. while i think the whole film is brilliant two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling on there belly's)are ambushed by americans and massacred,true horror, and as an american soldier and a pretty philippine girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road, she smiles as she flits with the yank,then her face changes to rage as she see's two japanese soldiers trying to surrrender, she grabs a gun and kills them with joy, the american soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance , to me this speaks volumes at the atrocity's committed by the japanese in the philippines, all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it.
