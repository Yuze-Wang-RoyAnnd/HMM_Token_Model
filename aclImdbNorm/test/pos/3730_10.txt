great movie. post-apocalyptic films kick ass. this one is no exception. kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). the fight between reno and the hero was tight. i also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. the connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, i had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. in sum, kick ass character progression, design, story without the cushion of dialogue, and most importantly, the always appreciated desolate scenery of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
