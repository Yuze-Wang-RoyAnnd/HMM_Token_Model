this film is a very descent remake of the famous fritz lang's masterpiece "m- murder".it is well made and with a entertaining key to speak about pretty serious events and contemporary problems in eurobe but not only the whole world.the ethnic intolerance is such a huge evil and very contagions nowadays. so "children of wax" or as it is known in us distribution reveals the question of german and turk hatred in an amusing way.no doubt it is well appreciated to be taken for distribution by the great weinsten brothers.and there is another fact i liked most is the participation in this movie of the favorite actor of lars von trier the great udo kier who shows to play with such a pleasure for the bulgarian film director ivan nichev.
