i was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout. i am a horror fan and i see almost everything in that genre, but dead line managed to freak me out. the pace is very cleverly set and andr'es bagg does a good performance as a desperate man. what is underneath the main plot? a trip to madness. how can you end up like that? martin sanders ask him self while he sees a homeless speaking to him self, alone in the street. close to the end of the film, the character of aaron mandel asks the same question while he sees another homeless doing the same thing; not knowing, yet, that this homeless is martin sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film. the broken eyeglasses in two are a clear symbol of rupture and division... of personality. the ending is jaw dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made.
