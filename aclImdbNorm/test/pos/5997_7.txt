this version of the gulliver stories is definitely bizarre. the production adds a frame story (that's what it's becoming famous for) of gulliver returning to his wife and son. in one vieweing, incredibly overlong and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout, but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking. mary steenburgen does the best job of the cast. danson seems a bit out of place with his american accent. the whole asylum thing is awfully disturbing often, but is nonetheless interesting and holds the journeys of gulliver together well. danson's character really does seem insane, however... he should have worked on being a little more believeable to everyone, in my opinion. also confusing is going from present to past. anyone else think the yahoos are the ugliest things ever to grace a television screen (or in line for it)? confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by some good acting, overall wonderful visual effects, and a few enjoyable parts. nbc's first of many event films from robert halmi, sr. see it for yourself to decide how it goes for you, however i give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
