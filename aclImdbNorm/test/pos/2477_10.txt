well i've enjoy this movie, even though sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation. i didnt understood at this time if the "punishment park" has exist in the past, but i think the matter isnt really here.<br /><br />you have to look at this movie in a different manner. it shows how much violence you can find in our world. it reminds us that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it. if anyone refuse to "take his responsabilities" then you will be thrown out of our society...all our history is made by wars, we should never forget this. in fact its only when we will finally accept the truth that, maybe, we will change and understand that our "intellectual skills" have improve. so we could use them to find others ways to resolve our problems.<br /><br />in 2 words this movie is a must see, maybe it will help us to accept the truth...
