this film gave me probably the most pleasant surprise of any i've ever seen. it was not a big-budget production and its premise, middle-age amateur jazz musicians get an unexpected professional engagement at a catskills-like resort, seems rather modest. what's not modest is the film's success. this is a little slice-of-life movie that is most entertaining throughout. director frank d. gilroy also wrote the script and it's full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists.<br /><br />the actors are journeymen who do a solid job. the biggest revelation to me was cleavon little. he plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for an ailing band member. his attitude immediately clashes with the others. while they see it as an opportunity for big fun and a once in a lifetime thing, he sees it as his job and not a particularly interesting one. this leads to conflict but when the group gets in trouble, he steers them through. little, who died too young, really showed me he was a fine actor with this film.<br /><br />this movie is a true sleeper, the kind that a film fan always hopes to discover. i recommend it wholeheartedly.
