things that are only just now "news" were taken as a given in this shocking documentary. i fear that as the investigation proceeds, the producers of this film will be vindicated in spades.<br /><br />the producers show us the davidians, the government agents, the investigators, with all their faults and all their humanity. nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening for yourself. pieces of evidence -- congressional testimony, 911 tapes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos -- are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing tale. <br /><br />do not wait. see this film and tell your friends.
