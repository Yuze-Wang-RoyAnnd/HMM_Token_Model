this film is not your typical hollywood fare, though the pickings are so bad i often tend to stay away from movies rather than be disappointed. however, this little low-budget gem is thoroughly loveable and enjoyable and definitely a keeper. the actors are as varied as the characters they portray, the buffalo setting is charming (what a pretty city), and the story sparkles. the lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the "f" word doesn't detract in the least! take the kids, take grandma, take a break from hollywood! i give it an 11 out of 10!
