insanely well crafted mini-series.<br /><br />i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs. was heavily promoted at the time. i believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater series.<br /><br />the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast. was 6-8 hours total. this length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. cut some interesting, but slow scenes.<br /><br />i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to dvd. not worth creating a vhs version at this point.<br /><br />would fit in very well in the mini-series or dramatic history genre.
