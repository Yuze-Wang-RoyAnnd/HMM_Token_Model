if the ending hadn't been so fantastically unexpected, i don't think i could rate this movie so well.<br /><br />this movie has a lot of uncomfortable, distressing, "marriage falling apart" character interaction. that sort of thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seemed to drag for me.<br /><br />in addition, the main characters are difficult to relate to and thus care much about -- the husband (alan rickman) is rather bitter and cranky and the wife (polly walker) is aloof and a little haughty. the acting was just fine (norman reedus was very alluring), but the characters themselves were perhaps a little too realistically flawed (for me).<br /><br />the setting was nice and appropriately isolated and a little spooky. the cinematography had something to it that seemed a little old-fashioned to me somehow.<br /><br />but the last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that every uncomfortable scene, awkward conversation, and inexplicable character behavior absolutely worth it. i guessed every typical plot twist except the one that occurred.<br /><br />the ending definitely makes this movie worth watching. the intrigue and the drama, not quite as much.
