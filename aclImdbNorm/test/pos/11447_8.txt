night of the demons (1988) was another in a long line of "teen" horror films that were released on video and pay-t.v. during that mecca of film making the eighties. but unlike most of the crap that was being peddled around, this one was actually a decent watch. a group of bored "teenagers" decide to party halloween night away with a pair of bizarre sisters (mimi kinkade and linnea quigley) at the infamous hull house. your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers are invited to the party. but an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive halloween night when they undead residents of hull house decide to crash the party. who'll survive this night of bloodshed and horror?<br /><br />a nice horror film that is best seen in the unrated version. if you watch the r-rated cut then you'll miss all of the splatter effects and nudity. stay tune for the amusing epilogue! a gory film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel. for horror fans only!<br /><br />highly recommended.
