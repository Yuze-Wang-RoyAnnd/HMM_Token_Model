here in germany "king of queens" has a big big cult status! nearly every teenager (and adults) watch this sitcom. it's really awesome!! better than the other horrible american sitcoms like "full house" or "set by step" (the only series, who is still ok, is "al bundy"). there haven't been an amercian sitcom in europe who was as effective as this really funny show!! kevin james and leah remini as doug & carrie haffernan are the craziest couple i know, jerry stiller as arthur is the funniest "grandpa" i know, and victor williams and (especially) patton oswalt as deacon & spence are the most different, but funny guys i know. i watch it as often as i could, and i still haven't enough, good humor!
