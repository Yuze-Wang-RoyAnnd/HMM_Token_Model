guts of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor guts of a virgin. although this film isn't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment, i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together all-the-way-around than virgin...but then again, that's not really saying much.<br /><br />beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straight-faced exploit film. a couple of yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion. as this nastiness is going on, the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in africa, and that they're gonna do the same to her. they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more. she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story. the rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide. the clinic worker, moved by the young lady's story, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower-level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the yakuza leaders. this whole plan backfires, so now ms. vigilante-clinic-worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse (some pretty rough butt-rape ensues along with the pre-requisite gang rape...). she too is drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim ----- it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic blood demon!!! (no sh!t, that's what really happens!!!) this is when beauty really takes off with some pretty f!cking insane kill scenes - including a very classy chest-burst-rape that looks like a cross between alien and a bad porn, and my favorite - a head-engulfed-by-demon-vagina kill (complete with demon vagina-slime...)that has to be seen to be believed...<br /><br />definitely some promising stuff going on in guts of a beauty, but still very disjointed feeling. beauty almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non-compatible way. still, i have to give the film credit - the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic, and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall. a solid 7/10 for another crazy j-horror "classic".
