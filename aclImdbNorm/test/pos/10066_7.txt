madonna gets into action, again and she fails again! who's that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of shangai surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan. she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie, not suspecting that this latter could be a flop, too. the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience, while in europe it was a success. madonna states that "some people don't want that she's successful both as a pop star and a movie-star". the soundtrack album, in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title-track single was agreat hit all over the world, as like as the world tour. the truth isthat madonna failed as an actress 'cause the script was quite weak. butit's not so bad, especially for those who like the 80's: it's such a ramshackle, trash, colorful and joyful action movie ! at the end, it's very funny to watch it.
