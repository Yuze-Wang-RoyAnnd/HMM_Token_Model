clive barker of hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting.<br /><br />the make-up done by bob keen and geoffrey portass was fantastic. it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground. it was really a treat to see the quality of work.<br /><br />it wasn't particularly horrible, as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer.<br /><br />i just saw craig sheffer in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also. nothing spectacular, but fair. this was only anne bobby's third film, and she was good also.<br /><br />the ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts, as did david cronenberg. ha!
