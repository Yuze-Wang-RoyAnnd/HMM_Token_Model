this was an excellent movie! i saw this at the karlovy vary iff in the czech republic, and it won an award there. this is the first film i've ever seen from jan (the director), and i was impressed. it's a great story about love and family. the movie has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama, and suspense all in one. i will not give away any of the plot, but this is a well-made film, and i would watch it again if i had the chance! the cinematography/editing is great, the film simply flows, and the characters are warm, and they are the kind that one can relate to. i hope you can enjoy this film as i did. if anyone knows where i can find this in the united states, or if they plan on releasing it on dvd anytime soon, please let me know!!
