the movie existenz is about a futuristic video game on a "pod" system that is almost like virtual reality. the only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (jennifer jason leigh). unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. the only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(jude law). this movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film. the best thing about this film were the twists toward the end. definitely worth seeing. 7/10
