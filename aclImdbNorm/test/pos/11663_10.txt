it was very sensitive very deep. it's my favorite all the time you can't see movie more deeper than this incredible movie. susan sarandon made her role as matured mind actress, and she realized her role. she deserved the award. she convinced me with for being a nun. the music was very impressive and sensitive. really i liked this deep masterpiece.
