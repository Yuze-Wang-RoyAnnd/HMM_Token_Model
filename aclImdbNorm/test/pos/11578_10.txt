i have seen 'the sea within' today and i loved it. the actors of the movie are wonderful (specially javier bardem, of course), but i thought that bel'en rueda would have a better role. lola due~nas, clara segura and, specially, mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations. and i cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist).<br /><br />there are two technical aspects i loved very much: aguirresarobe's photography and the score by amen'abar himself. i liked the song, 'negra sombra' ('dark shadow'), by luz casal with music of carlos n'u~nez.<br /><br />in short, i think that the spanish academy should choose 'the sea within' in order to compete in the oscar awards. i liked other spanish productions, such as almod'ovar's 'bad education', but amen'abar's film is much better than them. 'the sea within' deserves all the awards.
