considering the appalling track record of mick molloy since going out on his own, i had rather low expectations of crackerjack. even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous. in fact, if it wasn't for the fact that i'd received free tickets to the preview, i would have resisted the pressure from the missus (who thinks mick's a hunk - there's a worry) to pay money for it.<br /><br />the first few minutes of the movie had me worried - it starts with one of micks tired "get angry at insignificant things" routines, but that was given a neat touch, which at least made it a little refreshing. the rest of the script was pretty good, and very light hearted - even the typical mick molloy (and judith lucy) humour was delivered well and whilst i never had to pick myself up from the aisles, it generated a lot more chuckles that i was expecting (and it was consistant).<br /><br />there's nothing new in the plot - pretty predictable, but it moved along quickly between one-liners and other jokes - i never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short; mick must have worked hard on polishing his script. there were a one or two "late show" in-jokes, and one or two jokes that only melbournians would get - but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience.<br /><br />something that i found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of john clarke - he just didn't seem to work as the bad guy, but that doesn't detract from the movie too much.<br /><br />over all, i enjoyed this australain comedy, and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie. i left the cinema with a decent sized grin - a pretty hard thing for an australian comedy to do in my books. 7.5/10<br /><br />
