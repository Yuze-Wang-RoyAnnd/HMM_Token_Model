i love this movie and all aspects of it, well directed as a comedy and as a drama. the acting is tremendous, performed by an all-star cast who play the high society new york perfectly. the scenery is incredible, totally breathtaking. i also love the story: a successful nyc architect who is going through a midlife crisis leaves his cheating wife and runs off to a greek island to hide out with his daughter who chooses to go with him.<br /><br />i just cannot express my love affair enough regarding this movie. "show me the magic".
