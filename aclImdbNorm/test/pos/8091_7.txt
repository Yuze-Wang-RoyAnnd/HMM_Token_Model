great comedy from charlie chaplin. i've seen chaplin's 4 major films (gold rush, city lights, modern times, and the great dictator), and i think it is easily the funniest of the four. this movie had me laughing more than almost any other i've ever seen. from the very opening disclaimer ("any similarity between the great dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental") the movie is a laugh-a-minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. and at the same time, chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. maybe a little short on the ending and the lasting timeliness of the subject matter, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.
