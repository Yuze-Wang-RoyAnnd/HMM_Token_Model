there are a limited number of fans for movies in the world that would love a particular genre to go to the depths that this crew has done to bring to life something that the very writer of the original film had, up to this point, never achieved. this is a wonderful exploration of the real dedication and love it takes to reach towards a potentially very successful cult film.<br /><br />originally, with the blessings from alex cox, this crew began producing the sequel of one of his movies in absolute true punk fashion. their goal simply being to fully capture the atmosphere as it should be for a complete tribute to the original "repo man" film.<br /><br />this is a great tale of dedication and the treachery that can occur along the path to wonderful movie making. a truly entertaining tale and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.
