absolutely, i agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. it's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes german's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.in typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. these episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in germany,preferably in original language!!<br /><br />
