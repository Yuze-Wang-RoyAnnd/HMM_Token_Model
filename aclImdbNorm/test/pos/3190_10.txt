i came across this movie in an australian hotel room at 3 am. my brother and i were channel surfing and who do we see but a young russel crowe. but not the telephone throwing russel crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. this movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. it stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. if you are lucky enough to come across this film i would strongly suggest picking it up. i have to say this movie was amazingly entertaining and i thank the fine people of australia making it...
