this thing works on all levels -- it's intense as a thriller, full of lars von trier homages, but also very much its own film -- and it does have a message: happiness comes from within, best personified in the wounded soldier who practically (and, believe it or not, humorously) disintegrates limb by limb throughout the film, all the while apologizing to others for imposing on them. you laugh at him, but you envy him as well. the central character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from stockholm to berlin just after world war ii. he ties the parallel stories together, and really screws people up in the process. to say things go wrong is an understatement -- and structurally, the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other. it's like every one of them has an opposite -- just so tight, like watching anti-matter collide. you will not believe the sick stuff you end up laughing at. to say more would qualify as a spoiler -- all i can say is it is a shame this film has not been released in the us, not even on dvd. some moron probably told them americans wouldn't get it -- which is crap, because we not only "get" but produce things like south park... if this film gets marketed in the us, it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy, because that's what it is. over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
