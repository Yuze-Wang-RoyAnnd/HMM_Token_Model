the movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. putney swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a "token" on the board. swope is ignoring the meeting, reading jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring swope... suddenly, the ceo croaks on the spot. no time is wasted. a janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new ceo. and as the votes are tallied one by one, the tension is built up and then finally snapped in a hilariously ironic climax to the vote, that gives the viewer a delicious dish of logical implications to savor for the rest of the movie. if you've ever talked back to some stupid television commercial, you'll like seeing this movie. too bad there don't seem to be any real putney swopes in the world.
