one night at mccool's is one of those films that starts with an awful amount of promise but as the film goes on it becomes silly and loses it's way big time. liv tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by flaunting her body to every man she meets ,all of which fall under her spell.there are a few funny moments in this but they get fewer and fewer as the film deteriorates into a comedy farce. michael douglas who plays the assassin is good as is liv tyler, although she does look like she had put on a bit of weight since armaggedon. this is ok but is only memorable for the scene in which liv tyler washes her car, you will know what i mean when you see it fella's! shwing!!!!! 7 out of 10 (just).
