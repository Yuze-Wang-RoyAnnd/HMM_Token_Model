this movie needs to come out on dvd cause that's the only way i will buy it. i thought it was soo funny because there was no real plot to it. it was not suppose to be an oscar winning film. i appreciate those films. cary elwes was a very cute robin hood. i can't even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good. anyways peace out.!!!!
