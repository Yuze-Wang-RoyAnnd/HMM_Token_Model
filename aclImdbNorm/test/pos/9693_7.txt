this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention. it's not going to win any oscars - it's really not a very good movie at all. heck, it's not even really a movie - just a string of short disgusting, gross-out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment. and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score, gosh darn it, i'm going to give it a much better score. the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say, so i'm not going to give some snobby critique of jackass's quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and commentates on how our society....oh forget it.<br /><br />what's to say? there's no plot development, no character development - no real beginning - there's a semi-enjoyable end that's not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it, and everything in between reeks of improper, bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at. it's actually pretty funny.<br /><br />leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie. jackass: number two is just gross-out crap. that's really all it is. i do give the filmmakers this, though: they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff. you'll probably cringe several times throughout, want to throw up a couple times, wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomit-defying stunts. vomit, crap, urine, semen....virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in jackass: number two. there's nudity, sexual humor abounds, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />it's entertaining. if you're the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable, then you will probably really like jackass: number two. i laughed several times. like i said, it's pretty imaginative stuff. i never once wanted to vomit - though i do have a pretty strong stomach. just accept the movie's premise: a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun. once you get past that, accepting it and going with it, you'll enjoy it. the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff. there are several very imaginative, very disturbing skits, but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting. towards the end things pick up, but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film's quality. in a half hour tv show this isn't a problem, but with film length celluloid, it's inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point. after awhile the gross crap just becomes desensitizing.<br /><br />on the whole, though, number two is an entertaining, imaginative, and above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain, nausea, and hilarity. go see it if you must, but hey, if you know you don't like this kind of stuff, don't bother. you'll just be disappointed.
