i'm not sure whether i like this film or not. i think it is creepy and completely weird.crispin glover as always gave a great performance as layne. i think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. keanu reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. i disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (keanu reeves). i would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to. i was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice. if you are into creepy, weird and really well different movies, go for this one. if you like things that are normal, please stay away.
