this is an outstanding criminal thriller, and with a great cast too. spanish language cinema's best and most popular actors of the past couple of decades, victoria abril and federico luppi, team up in one of the better spanish language crime thrillers of 2004-5.<br /><br />the film begins by focusing on thirty something ernesto (ernesto alterio), an elegant, attractive and slick thief who learned from childhood friend gitano, and more recently from manco, an old seasoned swindler. manco introduces ernesto to federico (federico luppi), an also elegant, but more astute & experienced methodical thief - the best in his class.<br /><br />federico's only known weakness is pilar (victoria abril), his former mistress and partner. she suddenly appears and proposes a fabulous rip-off scheme to her former lover, a crime in grand scale, which will eventually require the help of ernesto, manco and gitano, among others.<br /><br />the script is full of twists and surprising reversals, particularly towards the end of the film. one criticism about the film i've heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end, but i disagree. the film captivates the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow. in fact, these are what make the film outstanding. i highly recommend it.
