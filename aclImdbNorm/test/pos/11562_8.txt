i haven't seen this film since it came out in the mid 70s, but i do recall it as being a very realistic portrayal of the music business ( right up there with paul simons "one trick pony " ..another vastly underrated film imo )<br /><br />harvey keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in , and the commercial "tripe" the record company "suits" want him to work with.<br /><br />since i spent my entire career in the music business as a composer /arranger /producer, i can really vouch for the verisimilitude this film possesses. <br /><br />if it should ever come out on dvd uncut, i'd buy it!
