having majored in western history when i was a student in college seeing the views on world war ii are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. world war ii was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history. while the axis powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every german soldier was out to exterminate the jewish population, not every japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze missions, and not every italian soldier was a fascist. most of these soldiers for the axis powers were normal people like you and i caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved.<br /><br />the battle of stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1,500,000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle. the film stalingrad follows a german platoon and its leader lieutenant von witzland as they are reassigned to the eastern front to battle the soviets at stalingrad. von witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, rollo and fritzi. they all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in germany and poland.<br /><br />the film follows the course of the battle. the film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. we are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). overall the battles are the earliest examples that i know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. much of the inspiration for saving private ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film.<br /><br />the film does not aim to make the german's completely innocent of everything in the film. several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. the film makes it clear quite quickly that not all germans were responsible for what happened during the holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. the film makes it clear that the soldiers in the germany army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in russia.<br /><br />the film really shows how hellish war is, especially world war ii. the battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. as with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. it will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the eastern front faced. not recommended for children. <br /><br />4/5 stars
