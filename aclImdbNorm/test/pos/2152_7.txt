biodoc on the enigmatic singer/songwriter who, according to friends' accounts, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of self-destruction. he died at 52, overweight and dissipated, of heart disease, after a protracted rampage of virtually non-stop overindulgence in alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, raucous partying, and flagrant misuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend that he shouted out his lyrics at one performance with such force that spattered blood was left on the microphone).<br /><br />all of this despite the fact that he was: (1) widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation; (2) successful, after years of effort, in terms of industry acclaim - a grammy, an oscar, a decent recording contract with a top label, and at least two stellar albums - 'nilsson schmilsson' (originals), and 'a little touch of schmilsson in the night' (standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), with a lovely young family that he seemed to adore.<br /><br />the film's strengths begin with the completeness of its account of nilsson's life, including fine use of archival film footage and many stills of nilsson; the editors do an especially good job of bringing movement to the stills. we learn of his close ties to john lennon and, later, ringo starr (lennon often said that nilsson was his favorite american musician).<br /><br />even more impressive are the talking heads, often a documentary's weakest aspect. here we get people like perry botkin, jr., ray cooper, mickey dolenz, terry gilliam, mark hudson, eric idle, rick jarrard, randy newman, van dyke parks, jimmy webb and robin williams, all telling amazing stories about nilsson
