'never been kissed' is a real feel good film. if you haven't seen it yet, then rent it out. i am going to buy it when its released because i loved it. drew barrymore is excellent again, she plays her part well. i felt i could relate to this film because of the school days i had were just as bad. i thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance which are the type of films i love. i loved the ending because even though you know what's going to happen, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating!!
