i have a problem with the movie snobs who consider americans to be uncouth semi - literates unable to appreciate the subtlety of the more sophisticated europeans,les francais,les italiens...just about anybody from le continong to whom english is a foreign language.if the humour in "my father the hero" is different from that in "mon pere ce heros" it is because the french sense of humour is different from that of the american.not better,not "more clever",just different. if you think it is crass for hollywood to "borrow" from the french cinema just consider how much the french cinema has borrowed from hollywood in the first place.where would belmondo and delon have been without bogart?truffaut without hitchcock?jerry lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style is idolised in france.go figure........ monsieur depardieu is exceptionally good as the hapless divorced father of a precocious 14 year old daughter on holiday in the bahamas together. unbeknowst to him,she presents him to the other people at the hotel as her lover so as to make herself more interesting to a boy she has her eye on .not surprisingly,complications ensue. there are "hommages" to "green card" and "cyrano de bergerac" amusingly inserted and m.depardieu goes along with it all very good - naturedly. he does a good maurice chevaler impression with "thank heaven for little girls" which is in fact funny and rather poignant as his audience,all of whom believe him to be the lover of a 14 year old girl,get up and leave two - by - two as he warbles away,blissfully unaware of what is happening.when he turns round at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause the expression on his face is priceless. without him the movie would be very average indeed.with his huge shambling figure dominating the screen it is a lot of fun.no pecs,no six pack - just a real proper human - type being.formidable!
