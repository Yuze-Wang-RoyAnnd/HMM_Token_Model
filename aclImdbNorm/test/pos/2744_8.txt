before the wwf became cartoon with hulk hoagan leading the way, the events of wwf tv broadcasts of the very early 1980s resembled the wild, wild west with all kinds of grudges and vicious acts of violence performed by some of the wrestlers that are known today to be the wwf's most beloved stars. some of these seemingly very real moments stand out. a maniacal sgt. slaughter whipped then champion bob backlund with a riding crop after backlund showed him up in a fitness test. welts were all over backlund! sarge made the iron shiek look like a daycare provider! slaughter also issued a challenge to anyone who could break his dreaded cobra clutch hold. this led a legendary and bloody alley match with commentator pat patterson. hall of fame member blackjack mulligan with freddie blassie came into the wwf with a claw hold that was censored on television. he claimed he was the true giant at 6'7" and challenged andre long before big john studd in 1984. adrian adonis used his ominously named "good night, irene" sleeper to take out the competition. a new yorker clad in black leather, he was an ominous figure. george "the animal" steele was far from a crowd pleaser, as well. even jimmy snuka was a fearsome sight as he set out maim opponents until ray "the crippler" stevens delivered a piledriver onto the cement floor leaving snuka a bloody mess. all these encounters took place a decade before hardcore wrestling was ever spoken of.
