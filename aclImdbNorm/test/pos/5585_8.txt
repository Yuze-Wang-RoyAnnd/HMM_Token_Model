i saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago, and i haven't forgotten it to this day. i couldn't say whether it's a good picture. but in those days i instantly fell in love with jean simmons. the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie, but i still remember the plot. simmons was very young then, and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: david lean's great expectations. and again it was the young jean simmons. it's a pity that blue lagoon is not available on video; i'd like to correct my memories...
