it's some years since i've seen this movie, so forget most of the details. however, i loved it at the time and found the plot intensely gripping, the climax heart stopping. i remember being literally on the edge of my seat at the theatre back in 1979.<br /><br />jane fonda plays a los angeles reporter, kimberley, who stumbles upon an accident at a local nuclear power facility. she wants to go public with the story, aided by her hippie cameraman (michael douglas) who has photographed the event, but a sinister conspiracy attempts to cover it all up. jack lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the nuclear plant's conflicted middle manager, torn between loyalty to his company and 'doing the right thing' by reporting the perilous situation. his facial expressions speak volumes here.<br /><br />apart from the engrossing plot and riveting tension, this film is all about jack lemmon, his character, and his superb acting performance. as for jane fonda (i was a huge fan of hers at the time), i suspect she just moved on from her anti-war protests to taking on the nuclear industry.<br /><br />this movie seems intended as a nuclear scare tactic. chernobyl and three mile island notwithstanding (they're different types of reactors), our canadian candu reactor is safe and well respected around the world. i wouldn't hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant about an hour's drive away, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. apparently they shut down for every teeny problem, irregardless of the financial loss. i sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies afoot there. one can hardly imagine any of the managers or highly trained operators willing to risk any sort of meltdown or whatever...it's absolute tomfoolery. of course the moral here is to spare no expense or effort either in building the facility or ensuring its ongoing safety. <br /><br />if we want our western lifestyle, we have to get our energy somewhere. for those who claim nuclear power can never be made completely safe (true, of course), perhaps they should volunteer as a coal miner or else return to pre electricity horse and buggy days. <br /><br />by all means, enjoy this entertaining and highly suspenseful movie, which apparently is based (loosely? embellished?) on a true story. it's a real chiller, a thriller, and maybe (?) even a killer, but please, don't get your attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it.
