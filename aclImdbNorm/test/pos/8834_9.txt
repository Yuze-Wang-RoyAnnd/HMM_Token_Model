obviously, the the responses here were written many years after the film was released and cannot be taken in context. back in 1980 in post labour england, this film was bloody funny. we were glad of something to laugh about and rising damp, with its sympathetic mockery of a complete social strata, was one of the best british sitcoms of its period, if not ever. it struck a chord in almost everybody and in true british fashion, we laughed at the rigsby in ourselves. america had nothing to touch this type of humour because self debasement was not amusing to our overseas cousins. leonard rossiter was one of englands finest actors, on stage, on tv and in movies. his commitment and professionalism were second to none. richard beckinsale was, although young, a perfect comedic foil to rossiter and should, by all rights, be classed as an all time great. had he not been taken so young, i feel sure he would, by now, be classified as one of britains greatest comedy actors. frances de la tour found her finest television moment in rising damp and, for me, never quantified her undoubted ability with further roles. if you did not see the film at the time of its release, you are not qualified to comment, simply because you cannot understand why it was funny, the humour of the moment.
