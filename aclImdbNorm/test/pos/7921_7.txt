this is one of those movies where you have to put to one side some of its obvious shortcomings (a result of the date and location of its production)and accentuate the positive. in many ways this is a truly superb film.<br /><br />forgive the parody in the one line summary, but the most serious shortcoming for an english speaker like me was the ghastly subtitles. the print i saw had 1982 soviet "film export" subtitles, which consistently used inverted grammar, presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech. the actual impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles which means you spend less time looking at the images. given that the cinematographic imagery is this films great strength, this is a real issue.<br /><br />other imdb-niks have written plenty about the stalinist propaganda elements of this film (just in case the viewer doesn't notice them for him/herself). they have also written plenty about the battle on the ice scene, which is superb in my view. <br /><br />the love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely..... almost totally lacks charm also. but it is good to cringe every now and then.<br /><br />i was familiar with the prokofiev music to this film long before seeing the film. the images and the music complement each other marvelously. and it is the images that will stick in the mind for a long time. bergman clearly learned a lot from these images - the imagery of his medieval pieces (e.g. the seventh seal, the virgin spring) building upon and enhancing eisenstein's ideas. this film was made in 1938 in the ussr. in that context it is a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. <br /><br />for the modern viewer, i suggest that you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on show.
