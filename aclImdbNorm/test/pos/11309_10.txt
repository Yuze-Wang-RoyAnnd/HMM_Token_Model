this is one of julie's greatest tributes to music, alongside her "trapped in the body of a white girl" album. to quote the great medusa "dare to go bare, just wear your underwear, you'll get a ride home everytime" - wow!!! now that is some good advice. "you can dance, at my party! yeah, justify your dance shoes!.....you're invited to the party in my pants. yeah come on boy let's dance, at the party in my pants" julie brown is hilarious!!! it is almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is awesome!!!
