okay, it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself. still, "the great dictator" is a fascinating movie. chaplin does a terrific job satirizing hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the jews in nazi germany (this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge). not a chaplin masterpiece, but still worth seeing.<br /><br />
