i felt cheated out of knowing the whole story. while there could be a twist, this twist was so significant, that i felt betrayed. i believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better. the writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the movie, rather than all at once at the end. that aside, i believe that the actors did very well with what they had, particularly matt damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing. the other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another. the cohesiveness of the group in ocean's eleven was gone.
