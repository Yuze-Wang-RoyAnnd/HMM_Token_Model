if you have a chance, see this russian(how should i call them: gems, masterpieces,hidden treasures?), war movies like this one, or the dawns here are quiet, or proverka na dorogah... and , right after that, watch again the american war movies, or the international productions, those one with the allies and the germans,etc. or, even worse, watch the italian war movies. everything from the west will seem shallow, contrived, ridiculous, in comparison with the russian movies. i am sooooo stunned by the quality of the aforementioned russian war movies that i cannot find the words to praise enough their shattering superiority over anglo-saxon war movies.
