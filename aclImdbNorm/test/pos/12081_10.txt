i saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in february of 1983. i was in the hospital, having just given birth to my first and only child. i'll refrain from telling you the extent to which i was moved. suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has remained with me to this day, almost 23 years later. i hope i can find a copy of this movie, if such a thing was ever made. this movie should be remembered fondly by anyone who ever saw it. however, i must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is just fine by me. this way, it will always be a small secret to me and those who were also moved by it. i never saw ms. margaret perform a better part. nor have i ever seen her in a more convincing role. i will forever respect her just for accepting such a lovely part.
