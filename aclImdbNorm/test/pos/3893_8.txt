not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. bill macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. great supporting cast, especially jamie cromwell as the extortionist private eye.<br /><br />the movie's greatest strength is the work of macy, who reminds us of his jerry lundergaard role from fargo. he has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. it's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while i was happy that things were turning out well for him. *** out of four.
