this movie is amazing. it is funny, sexy, violent and sick, but it all holds together for a brilliant troma rendition of romeo and juliet. if you don't mind being grossed out a bit (ok a lot, but it's funny grossed out), see this movie. it's worth it!there's not one level on which it doesn't deliver. i've seen it thrice now, and it is still amazing. i recommend it. go! get it!
