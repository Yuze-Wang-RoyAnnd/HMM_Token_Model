please why not put this fantastic film on dvd,i have been searching just like the previous writer for years, whats the hold up, or show it on tv. its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read, and believe i have read some.i seem to think it was read on radio 4, but i can't find that either. why not try and remake it even, i promise it will be top earner, people love those sorts of stories, so please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it,although i doubt if it could be improved upon. has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with jennifer jones, this is superb, but not to the same extent may be.
