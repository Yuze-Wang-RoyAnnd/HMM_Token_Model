this is not a story. it's a bunch of psychic needles reaching for your subconscious. if you wait for a story you'll be bored. but if you give yourself over to it you'll be inside it's dreamworld within 10 minutes. the vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for your own fantasies. the strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of christ, the pulsating light and deep dark shadows, they all reach to your subconscious to fill in this mind-space. i found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my television. it was like dreaming with eyes wide open. a strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience... it touched me deep inside and marked me for live. it freed my mind and gave me one of that rare experiences of loss of personality, and merging with the world of archetypes. a little freedom for the soul. a violent freedom however.... not a nice movie, but a very strong and unforgettable one. literally my text has no spoilers. for me the great surprise of this film was the unbelievable intensity of it, and describing this can be understood as a spoiler. the less you know about this film as you watch it, the better.
