penelope spheeris (of "wayne's world" fame) made her mark with the documentary "the decline of western civilization", about the la punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s. most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts (which often turn violent). overall, we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: whereas the hippies were into being natural, the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible, what with spiked hair and all. but also, we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads.<br /><br />anyway, this is a really great time capsule. we're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it. but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. truly worth seeing.
