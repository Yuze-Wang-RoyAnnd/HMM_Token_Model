this film is chock-full of little surprises, many of them funny. the fact that it's written and directed by a 24-year old blows my mind. some of the scenes where the high school kids are using ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because i have a kid that age and i could picture her using it. as parent of a teen, i found the depictions of the parent-child interactions to be dead-on accurate.<br /><br />i enjoyed the film's many little jokes, and i enjoyed the fact that not everything made perfect sense and not all the issues were resolved by the end. to paraphrase mark twain, truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is required to stick to that which is possible, while truth is not.<br /><br />this is a film which plays with the viewer, allowing us believe that people are what other people think they are, only to allow us later to realize that the folks we assumed were right were completely ignorant of the real situation. one of the film's strongest scenes, a scene about which we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character is doing, turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption, and the character, while admirable, is totally wrong. it's very subtly done, i think. very realistic.<br /><br />i liked the score a lot -- i thought it really aided the film, really helped set the mood -- the film has a couple of screwball moments, and the background music helps establish that.<br /><br />the valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half -- got a big laugh! the movie is really in my head right now -- saw it this morning. will try to see it again, time allowing. tens are hard to come by, but a solid nine in my book.
