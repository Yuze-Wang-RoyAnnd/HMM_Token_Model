if you like subtle psychological dramas/thrillers this is a movie for you. those who want to see an ordinary sex'n'crime erotic thriller surely will not understand this movie, as colin firth obviously did when he called it "rubbish". but jennifer rubin is the real star of the movie anyway. she is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! along with the twisting and turning storyline, that gets more and more psychological and makes you think about yourself, the wonderful directing, photography and especially the music make this movie a masterpiece. also the small parts are very good, especially belinda waymouth is terrific in her small scene. i hope it gets released on dvd soon, and a soundtrack album would be a dream coming true!!
