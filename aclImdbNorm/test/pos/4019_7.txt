like the first film in this series (slaughter, 1972), i think it would be a mistake to just label this a "blaxsploitation film". sure, slaughter is a tough, gun-toting, black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys--and a very good action picture at that.<br /><br />for the second and final time, jim brown plays the title character. the film begins with one of the goofiest scenes i can remember in a film. as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party, along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire! no, slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his .357! but slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happened--however, slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it! well, it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie. in it, slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico. now, in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt, the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss slaughter. and, because the job was bungled so badly, the mob boss (ed macmahon!!) orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin (don stroud--in a very typical sort of role for him). stroud is great--scary and nasty to the core, but ed macmahon as the boss?! wow, that's an interesting twist! <br /><br />slaughter is now stumped. he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them, they were dead. so, to help him along in his own private vendetta, brock peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work. so, slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobster's mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials. and, naturally, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process.<br /><br />stroud isn't about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps slaughter's girlfriend. now it's a standoff--slaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back, the lady is dead. being a tough but gallant man, you might just be able to guess much of what happens next.<br /><br />the action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough. the only negative i noticed was that while having macmahon play this nasty boss, at the end, he simply folded--and way too quickly. when slaughter catches up to him, macmahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappears--and this is too much of a clich'e and inconsistent. still, despite this minor quibble, it's an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs.
