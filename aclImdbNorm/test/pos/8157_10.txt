excellent performance by mary kay place, steve sandvoss, jacqueline bissett and rebekah johnson. superb story that reels you into the movie, emotional, yet light-hearted. i own this movie, and everyone that i've shared it with, loves it. great for mixed company, 18+ crowd.<br /><br />nice production, not a cheap budget, well organized, and keeps your interest. uses dome newer ideas, for flashbacks, and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat.<br /><br />no matter what walk of life a viewer is from, they will buy-in to one or more viewpoints in this film.<br /><br />would love to see a sequel!
