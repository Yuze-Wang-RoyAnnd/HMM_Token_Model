i am a huge tenacious d fan, and i think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. it's not laugh-a-minute but that's not what the d intended it to be. i went into the movie seeing all the hbo shows, memorized both albums, and that made it even more enjoyable. plenty of inside jokes from past tenacious d albums, and hbo shows. since i knew the new album already, i knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. i would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. hands down.<br /><br />see this movie now!
