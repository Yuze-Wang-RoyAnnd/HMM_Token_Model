"what alice found" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! i underestimated it when i heard of it, and i though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. they say all indie movies suck, but this one, and "napoleon dynamite" didn't suck. i asked my friend, who'd seen it before i did, and she said that alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that i remember, and little nudity. the movie did have a point, and it taught me never trust hitchhikers. i liked that in the end, they got alice a little dolphin in the end, on her way to flordia. i totally suggest seeing this movie.
