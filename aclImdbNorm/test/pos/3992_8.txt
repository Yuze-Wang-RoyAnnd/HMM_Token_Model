that's right. ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. what strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. and the message is sad. it says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other vips of this world. and even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. it is about the battle of a single person with a system. with many systems.<br /><br />a great film of this wonderful korean director. please see it if you do have an opportunity.
