if this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. i love this. everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. i think all the minor characters are wonderful. if someone like joan crawford is over the top, it's all part of the package. if you pick out many things in the movie, it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties as women were starting to not "take it lying down," at least not if they didn't want to. as far as characters being contradictory, for instance, suzy parker's character acting like she's all for flings, but then getting too attached to louis jourdan's character, isn't that what many people are like--contradictory? they mix in real stuff with scenes like diane baker's character finding the love of her life after miscarrying her illegitimate baby in an accident--lying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head. this is part of the package too, it's charm--glossy escapism. i like the mix of real stories pertinent today (the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men, therefore doesn't have a family when she is older) with ones that make you wish, "ah, if only i could fall in love with a doctor and he'll love me even though he knows my sordid past, and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident!!" also, i just got the dvd, widescreen, it's yet even more beautiful than full screen... yay!
