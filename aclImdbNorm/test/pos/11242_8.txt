i can't say this show is perfect. perhaps all the previous commenters remember the old tuesday 10:30 slot taken up by the childish humour of butch elvira curt ("there's a space shuttle humping a 747!"). oh the glory of scrambling to hit any button on the remote to make it change.<br /><br />face it, comedy can't pull a showcase and create the comedic genius of the truly canadian trailer park boys. but hey, they try.<br /><br />this show is by far one of the better original shows. however, none of the following will find themselves laughing at the apparent "players" who showcase their stupidity in picking up girls:<br /><br />a) "dumb" girls - obviously, they can't realise that they are just like the girls on the show. oblivious. jump on the man meat, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name. he looks good, he must be popular and nice. hahahaha!!! oh but you'd never do that! nobody would... if they knew it was happening<br /><br />b) unsocial guys who think women like nice guys - obviously seeing these guys succeed at what you fail at or don't even get to experience is going to make your primal rages boil. watch more closely, they get shot down most of the time. they say stupid crap.<br /><br />c) girls with respect for one another - obviously seeing your separate distinctly female species get caught up in real world situations is wrong wrong wrong. nobody gets played. women are not objects, they can't be played, because they are all very faithful angels who are going to clubs to converse politely with one another without fear of guys trying to pick them up.<br /><br />oh wait... hmmmmmmmm<br /><br />as much as everybody will say that this show is not funny, and that it doesn't teach you anything, i have to take the opposite side. the show is very good at detailing the way relationships work for both men and women. the way they think, and the way they think each other think, and social hierarchy. its funny to see and hear the guys make absolutely idiotic comments to things the women say ("my grandfather died recently" "oh... well are we having fun tonight?").<br /><br />besides, its a club. the place people go to have fun, and get laid. no matter who you are, you're going to a club to get or give attention to someone. guys go there to test their game and pick up girls. girls go there to flirt with guys and find the one that sweeps her off her feet the best. lighten up!<br /><br />if you're a guy, learn a thing or two about different approaches and the different effects they have. if you're a girl, learn what these "studly" man whores really think like, and learn to tell them apart from genuine guys. next time you get broken up with by one of those douchewads, realise its not because of him, its because you're dumb and thought he was the greatest guy ever when he was quite clearly a dick to you the whole time
