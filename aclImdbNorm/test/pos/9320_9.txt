one of the better musical bios. dennis morgan is great as the singer/composer chauncey olcutt. the supporting cast is very good, especially andrea king as the glamorous lillian russell. the turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting. the technicolor is excellent. a simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer.
