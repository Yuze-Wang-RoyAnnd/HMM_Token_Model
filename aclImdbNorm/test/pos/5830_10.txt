i admit that i almost gave up on watching tv shows. why? because most of them are about doctors, forensics or some girl/boy, who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat. but i must say i was wrong when i watched the first episode of oz, one of the most brilliant shows on tv until today. oz is a show about maximum secure prison and shows episodes in life of every cell - mate inside the prison and their frustrations. what i like about this show is the fact it has the courage to show the real life in prison without any annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogs. even thought the characters in the show are not supposed to be heroes, you became quickly attached to them and their life. sure, their is a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and taking drugs, but that's the point of this show; to present how brutal and frustrating can be life in prison... heck, you can't show life in prison like a "clean environment" with "likeable characters", right? oz is perfect in every way, the actors are doing an excellent job and the whole hour of this show is going threw really really fast. the only thing that i didn't like in this show was the last season of the show, i think it became too weird and brutal and the finale was not satisfying. but overall oz is still my favorite show on tv so far, it surpasses sopranos and million csi and dr. house crap with just a main title. brilliant show which has the balls to show what other shows are taking away from us; realism.
