stan as a bullfighter, and a good one, is quite a surprise. usually overshadowed by oliver hardy, this silent short allows him to take the lead, and the limelight.<br /><br />one can only draw the conclusion that his character "rhubarb vaselino" was a parody of the many rudolph valentino movies of this era.<br /><br />be prepared to laugh yourself silly at some of the dialog, and keep an eye on the special effects.<br /><br />i viewed this on dvd in a vol.1 & 2 collection.
