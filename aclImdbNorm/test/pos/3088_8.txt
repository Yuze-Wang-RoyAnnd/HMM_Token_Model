after i've seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. i'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. i know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'robin hood' is turned into a comedy. many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. <br /><br />mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood: men in tights. i have seen the original robin hood movies as well, but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one. it's just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies (winston churchil, the godfather...).<br /><br />i recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie. to those who think robin hood shouldn't be messed with, you're wrong, but you better don't watch it because you'll probably be offended by it. i give this movie an 8/10.
