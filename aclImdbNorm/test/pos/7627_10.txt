the last dinosaur is a film that is meant to be fun and exciting. it succeeds at doing both.<br /><br />maston is a big game hunter who hunts big game(go figure). owning a company he is planning on going on an expedition with a group of people including a photographer named frankie, a japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company named chuck, and an african guy who has aided him on many safari's named bun ta. the point is to study what is believed to be tyrannosaurus rex, dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. they will be getting to this prehistoric area taking a drilling vehicle that travels underwater called the polar borer. after getting to the area they soon find the tyrannosaurus, which maston tries to shoot but his gun gets jammed. chuck immediately senses that maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all along to add it to his collection of "stuffed animals". while they were away, tyrannosaurus invades their camp and takes the polar borer away from their camp. upon returning the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than they expected and maston states that he will kill the tyrannosaurus.<br /><br />the story is great for a science fiction film. drilling to a prehistoric area is something that seems could really happen. the scenery is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs could still reside.<br /><br />also i liked the characters in this film. maston is the typical big time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a trophy kill. also great was bun ta, played by luther rackley formerly of the nba, who really looks and acts like an african tracker. jackie is the typical female who causes problems for the group and seems to not belong in the wilderness. chuck is the former employee of maston who has his view of his boss change when he is in the wild with him.<br /><br />the tyrannosaurus in this film is one of the best in a film. it stands a little too up-right like godzilla does and it drags its tail, so it is a guy in a suit. but the suit looks good, especially the head and the tail, and the tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. i have seen plenty of other films where dinosaur suits look way worse. tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes emits a roar sounding like godzilla's and other times roars like king kong from "king kong escapes" and "king kong vs godzilla". so a great tyrannosaurus.<br /><br />there is plenty of action in the last dinosaur. of particular note is a great fight between tyrannosaurus and triceratops. also a great scene where bun ta tries to spear the tyrannosaurus. there are other great parts that i wont give away. you have to see for yourself.<br /><br />i recommend this film to everyone. watch it and you will not be disappointed.
