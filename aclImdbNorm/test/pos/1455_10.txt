frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best. if i had to name the best thing he ever did, though, it would be his performance as frankie machine, the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just barely, by the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious kim novak). the "cold-turkey" scenes between sinatra and novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. the movie is very nearly perfect, in fact, from saul bass's title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by elmer bernstein. it might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s, but it's a must-see nevertheless.
