this film was made thirteen years before i was born but i still think it is the wittiest, dottiest, most harmless piece of fun ever made. it simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb british character actors it boasts.<br /><br />where to start? alastair sim-peerless; margaret rutherford-ditto;the wonderfully alkward, innocent gossage, played to perfection by the imperious joyce grenfell. the caddish victor hyde-brown (a guy middleton special) and the rest of the staff sum up post-war middle-class england to a tee.<br /><br />the humour is sometimes obvious, but it is of that special "ealing" variety and is never offensive.<br /><br />i have watched this film more times than i care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time. the storming of the dorms occupied by the girls school, the magnificently-planned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy, are priceless.<br /><br />it's an old clich'e i know, but they really do not make them like that anymore. how i wish they did. if you haven't seen it, please do, you won't be disappointed.
