there are a lot of people that put down on these type 80's movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time. i was just starting college when this movie was released so i could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and i still, to this day, will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie. as much as i liked sean penn's character jeff spicoli in "fast times", i actually enjoy chris penn's character "tommy" more because he is the lead character with more of a actual speaking roll opposed to just a series of one liners such as with spicoli. chris penn should probably pop this film in his vcr and use it for motivation to lose some weight. yes, the subplot with the randy quaid, vietnam vet character does seem a little out of place, but he does a convincing job in the role. if there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as "fast times", etc. i highly recommend it.
