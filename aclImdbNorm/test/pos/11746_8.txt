this film immediately catches the eye, with the atmospheric aerial views of a very pretty hong hong. filmed in those rich colours of 1950 films which modern blockbusters never seem to capture. probably a sign of those times, because this is not a high powered, seen it all before film, full of havoc and violence. the havoc and violence are there though, in the backdrop, with thousands of refugees trying to get out of china this is a very moving and compelling story, full of hope and love in a tragic time, in recent history. the story of two people from different cultures falling in love. and the build up to them trying to overcome this is the heart of this very fine and moving film.
