this has got to be one of australia's best productions. i completely disagree with the comments made by 'raminour101'.<br /><br />this series shows the depth of australian mateship and the lengths they went to to help each other out. episode five 'eddies birthday' is a great example of this and it really captures the australian spirit.<br /><br />the music used throughout the series only emphasised the situation that the men were faced with, their longing for home and their loved ones. the numerous amusing renditions of the road to gundagai captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home, and that it was little elements such as the singing of a song that took them home for a short while.<br /><br />as for the comment about it being racist towards japanese people, the only thing to be said is that you can't change what happened. the japanese did treat the australians very poorly in changi and to represent it as otherwise would be very misleading indeed. the comment about the screenplay being in accurate is also false. these six stories that are told in the series are composed from real p.o.w experiences.<br /><br />the actors were superb; the best being in my opinion, matthew newton. his performance as david in the first episode was gut wrenching. from being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. we see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we can see how that one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help out the other members of the secret nine.<br /><br />stephen curry also deserves a mention. his performance in 'eddie's birthday' is amazing, going from the larrikin of the group, to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. the displays of mateship in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be australian.<br /><br />i study wwii at university level and have found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually truthful, as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an australian soldier.<br /><br />well done to john doyle for capturing the spirit of changi.
