i am probably a little too old for this movie, 16, and being a guy, the story is a little too girlie, but i really thought it was a cool movie overall. all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses, from alana, to adrianne, to deena, to kimberly, all the way down to the cute girl that plays alana's little sister, rachel. i am not a huge pop-star fan with the lovesick songs, but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this, and seems like he was really into this movie, and made it seem real. my mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with, so that's cool too. i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people, and wonder if i will see them again? a sequel would be cool. i rented this, but i might buy it too, since i have a ton of dvd's, and like to go back to see something that i missed. i couldn't buy it at blockbuster though, so i don't know where i could buy it right now, but i'll look into that. anyway, i am a 16 year old guy, i already said that, i know, but i would totally take a date to see this. it's really good for all ages, really. i think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this. that's what is so cool about it, that it is something that all ages can see. i'm sure that was done on purpose, but it really works. girls can dream about being with aaron carter, and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie. there is something for everyone.
