let me waste a moment of your time to explain how i approached this film. 1st i dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of aliens, which i consider to be one of the weakest films in the alien series. stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after i heard positive things about it from people whose opinions i trust, i missed the theatrical run completely. i then became hooked on farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found pitch black on cable one night around bed time - so i said "oh why not, at least it has claudia black in it." soon, i recognized keith david, and began to realize that vin diesel, radha mitchell and cole hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, i do not know). i was captivated. i have now remained captivated for four years. i just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and i still love it.<br /><br />this is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. sound to good to be true? don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.<br /><br />the film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic vin diesel, introducing the character of richard riddick. diesel would go on to star in the somewhat riddick-ulous chronicles thereof (which i also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. checking out the dvd version of pitch black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.<br /><br />the film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. the new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (diesel). is that all? of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.<br /><br />as unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, pitch black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.
