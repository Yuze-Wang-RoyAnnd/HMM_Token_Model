when i went to see this movie i thought that this would just be another chic flick i would have to endure with my sister. plus too amanda baynes last movie was not so hot, making me doubt the movie for she is the lead actress.however within 5mins i was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not "out there" that it took more then a second to understand it but very funny. the script was not too complex that i could not understand the love triangle but was very true to the original play by shakepeare. i loved every minute of it so much that i kicked a guy two seats away from me in a fit of laughter lol!!! very embarrassing! i'd definitely advise people to see this movie especially girls as the guys in this movie are hot hot hot!!(lol) so much so that i might just get it on dvd.
