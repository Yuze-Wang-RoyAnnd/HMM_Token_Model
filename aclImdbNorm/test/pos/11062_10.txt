i would rate this film high on my list of ingrid bergman films. ingrid's beauty aside, her talent is evident in scene after scene. she was sad, mean, witty,<br /><br />snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully funny, loving, tender, sorrowful, distressed, happy, etc. you name it, she was all those things and more. -and so<br /><br />convincing. ingrid plays a notorious woman (clio) who comes back to new<br /><br />orleans and falls for a texas gambler, gary cooper (clint). i especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing, just staring at each other. she, in an elegant white gown and he in a handsome white cowboy<br /><br />outfit, sitting there looking at her adoringly. what chemistry! what love!
