i read the book in a summer book club, and all of us there loved it. my friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie, lest the book be ruined. i didn't agree, and watched it recently with my younger brother and my parents.<br /><br />i was pleasantly surprised. the movie was very true to the book, without losing it's own spirit. the 'new kid' theme was shown just enough so that we get a feel of it, but that's not what the story's about.<br /><br />the acting wasn't the best i've ever seen, but it was still good, and the kids especially had a lot of energy. the characters were interesting, and the plot was cute and not too overstated. it was a kids movie that works just fine for adults or teenagers, too.<br /><br />i wish there had been a bit more tough-girl attitude from beatrice, but she was still a great character. mullet fingers was quite a bit like i had imagined him, except his hair was a little obviously dyed, with blonde hair and dark eyebrows. roy worked very well as the little guy and the new kid, especially interactions with his parents and friends.<br /><br />the message and the ending (which i won't discuss other than i liked it) teamed up to make a great cheer-up movie for a rainy day. all in all, this was a great film that you can watch again and again whenever you need reminding that the world isn't a horrible place after all.
