this is a beautifully-made film, finely balancing the fragile human stories (both before and after 1945) and the indiscriminating combat of war. the use of outtakes from battle of britain (a film that does not nearly so well portray the 1940s!) enhances, rather than detracts from the whole. a deeply impressive work, this lived in my memory for the 2 years since i saw it, and i have just bought it to explore the making-of extras.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film (movie). like "aces high", it alternates between viscerally exciting (or scary) air combat sequences, where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they'd come to care about, but also unpredictable interactions on the ground, where skillful writers and real-life experiences inform some involving and moving events. this also underlines the fact that for many people, 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another, and even today we still don't recognise the loss, bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes, or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails - making their sacrifices all the more valiant.<br /><br />watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy, and back to love that endures even beyond death. if all war films were like this, we'd never have to fight again.<br /><br />did i mention it's worth watching? ;-)<br /><br />10/10
