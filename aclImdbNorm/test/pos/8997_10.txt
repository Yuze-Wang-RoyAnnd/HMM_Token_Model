this movie has made me a rugby -- and coach larry gelwix -- fan. the story's characters slipped and fell before they begin to grow as they struggled through incredibly strong conflicts. those were understandable and completely believable. like life, there were no easy answers for the problems facing them all. superb actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life. i wish there were more movies like this one. these days, i watch almost exclusively, worthwhile true stories because they are typically far more interesting than fiction. additionally, this one is inspirational and it teaches us to not to give up on anyone too quickly.
