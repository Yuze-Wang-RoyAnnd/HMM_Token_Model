i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. i was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.<br /><br />i will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. until the very last minute i did not know how it would turn out. frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction. i could not do that with this film.<br /><br />i would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre.
