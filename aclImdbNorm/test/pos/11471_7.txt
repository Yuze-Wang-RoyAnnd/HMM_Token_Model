i was given a dvd of public enemies and was expecting it to be the 2009 version but it wasn't - it was this! sure, it wasn't the greatest movie i have ever seen - not by any means - but, heck folks, it was worth more that 2.8 out of 10! when i saw that abysmal rating on imdb, i wondered what i was going to get but, since the disc was in the player, i settled down to watch it. as other commentators have pointed out, public enemies is not a historical movie per-se - and i noted that, unlike the 2009 version (which i haven't seen yet) imdb doesn't categorise it as such.<br /><br />come on people! it's a story based on some real people - that's all! if i wanted a history lesson, i'd sit at this computer and read wikipedia or something. ma barker (actual name arizona - or arrie - barker) was never even charged with any crime and, as other commentators have already pointed out, she probably never even took part in her sons' activities. they sent her to the movies when they were "working"! (i hope she wasn't as critical as some of those who watched this movie!) <br /><br />theresa russell had the never-too-easy task of portraying a woman from the age of 17 right through to her death at the age of 52 - from a young girl running from home to the hardened mother of four hoodlum sons. i think she did it pretty well. the cheeky little smile she used in more than one scene was classical! ok, i will agree with some of the critics that the direction of this film was below par and i sympathise with the actors over that. theresa should have told the director to forget the topless shots - they didn't contribute to the story. maybe some bigger-name stars would have managed to inject some of their own expertise into overriding the poor direction whereas the second-graders weren't quite that brave. who knows? <br /><br />but, whilst this was certainly no block-buster, it was worth more than 2.8!! i have all my dvds on a personal database where i score them before looking at the imdb score (although that sometimes influences slight changes later). i take what i get on it's own merits rather than holding one movie up against others of the same genre and this one i felt was entertaining enough to get 6.8. (yep, i'll accept that such a practice does tend to depend on my mood at the time, but then isn't that also true of those who vote on imdb?) however, you may imagine my surprise when i looked at imdb and saw the pitiful score it got here.<br /><br />given the surprise, i decided to read a few of the other comments in the hopes of understanding the low rating and i noticed that they are quite polarised. i agreed with those who said the movie was worth watching and came to the conclusion that some people are just hard to please. well, since some were absolutely scathing, why don't they get out there and make some better movies? i will look forward to the gems they must be able to turn out! on the other hand, if they can't do that, then why don't they just shut up?
