it's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is. it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. it never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. that along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. aamir and salman are outrageous, even raveena and karishma are funny in this movie. paresh rawal and shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but viju khote and the ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. if you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long. this movie is just as long, but i wish there was more when it ends, cause it's an amazing flick.
