this movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. if you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. one of the funniest parts is when gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like hansel and gretel then he and his wife go home with them. the soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: "inspection officer -- here!" and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably. when i have shown this movie to my friends, they usually say "what was that?!?" so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies, yippee! this movie is so oop it's not funny anymore, so probably the easiest way to get it would be online auctioning. the first time i saw it was from a rental.
