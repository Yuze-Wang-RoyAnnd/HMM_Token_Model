i don't know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film. perhaps that is the romantic image many americans have of the time this film is set, as it is in the middle of the war, macy has returned from the war (his neighbor asks "hey, is it true you got a fritz over there?") and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of rabid anti-semitism, and macy and dern could wrapped up in it. funny how neither is jewish in this film but the accusation is made. also it is historically accurate, as the labor union democrats of this time wrapped themselves in the flags of america and god. macy is continually pestered to come to the "meeting". his presence brings unexpected results.<br /><br />applying this time frame to today is a study in contrast. in 2005, has undergone a complete reversal, with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their unifier supporting the republican party and viewing organized labor as part of left-wing 'unpatriotic' america.<br /><br />a great picture to watch, if you care to see the friendly, timid and meek macy (played beautifully by him) get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid 40's in nyc.<br /><br />a tough, emotionally charged film.
