the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team!<br /><br />one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom! all appearing in this short are dee green, the beautiful christine mcintyre, doris houck, alyn lockwood, johnny kascier, nancy saunders, and emil sitka. green and mcintyre provide great performances here! there are so many funny parts here. this is a very hilarious short. there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both!
