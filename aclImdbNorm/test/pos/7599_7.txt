women will like this movie better than men. of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men - on average. i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit, however i considered this a 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and about a 6.5 for the next 40% and about a 9 for the last 10%. so, begrudgingly, i will rate it a 7. i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse - at least that's my objective. i have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs.<br /><br />my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me, though i'm not sure why. i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is.<br /><br />the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school (undercover) to write a story about the high school experience nowadays. she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around. her journey toward cooldom, as well as her falling in love with a teacher, is the story.<br /><br />what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked. i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog. so much so that i truly don't think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. argh! naturally, she transformed into a rather attractive (cute) woman by the end and she became very popular.<br /><br />the ending is about a 9.9 on the very sweet scale, so you sappers out there will like that. otherwise, it isn't very memorable and easily missable.
