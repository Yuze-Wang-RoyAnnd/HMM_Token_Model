based on a william faulkner short story, two soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. the story involves two dirt poor mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the japanese attack on pearl harbor. the younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer jonathan furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the army himself. ron perlman gives a gruff but touching peformance as the army colonel who decides to help the kid.<br /><br />because it is only 39 minutes long, this gem will be hard to find (it will most likely be confined to the festival circuit for now), but remember the name aaron schneider--this picture marks him as a director to watch.
