i saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. i read somewhere that oz and rudnick wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies, but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies. also, some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side, joan cusack was too over-the-top for me, and someone has a strange timeline re the oscars. still, there were more than enough funny moments, like the kiss scene, the wedding that isn't, and the scene with the principal, to enjoy this. kline as always is good, but for me, the real surprise was selleck, whom i'm not a big fan of, but pokes fun at himself nicely here.
