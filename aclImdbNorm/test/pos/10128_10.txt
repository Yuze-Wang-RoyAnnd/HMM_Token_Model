i'm normally not a drama/feel good movie kind of guy, but once i saw the trailer for "radio", i couldn't resist. not only is this a great film, but it also has grreat acting. cuba gooding jr. did an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy, a.k.a. "radio." ed harris also did a fantastic job as coach jones. i was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well. so for a great story, great acting, and a little comedy, i give "radio" a 10 out of 10!
