cia analyst douglas freeman (gyllenhaal) gets to see his first secret location interrogation when anwar (metwally) is accused of having contact with a known terrorist bomb maker. anwar's wife (witherspoon) is frantic regarding the whereabouts of her husband .<br /><br />don't you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? i must have an old edition as this rendition is not a musical piece. no, it's the government's way of legally taking a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the desired information. <br /><br />while watching this movie i was reminded of a similar story line in the crossing jordan tv show (now off the air), and i expect we will see even more of these story lines. it's inevitable. the events of 911 are the catalysts. <br /><br />this is a tough one to watch because we don't like to see people tortured and our government not telling the truth about things. we like the idea that no matter what happens or happened that we can go somewhere to find answers, but when that door is closed to us, we are truly lost and without hope as anwar's wife was. <br /><br />performances by all were first class and it's possible we may see more of igai naor (i have no idea how to pronounce it) because he resembles and can act like telly savalas. no kidding. <br /><br />violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: yes
