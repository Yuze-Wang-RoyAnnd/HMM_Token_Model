i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend, and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend. i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what caleb and his sister were like when they grew up. in addition, i liked the carry-through of the "billy-boy" song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie, the title "sarah, plain and tall." however, the one thing in winter's end that i didn't like was the youngest daughter. she was a very cute little girl, but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to talkative but still good-natured caleb when he was younger.
