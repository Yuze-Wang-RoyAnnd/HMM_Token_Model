this first (and hopefully not last) wallace & gromit feature lives up to expectations. there are plenty of jokes (some a bit cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies. with the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from hollywood it's great to see such a great film like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone. if there is any justice it will be top of the box-office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next oscars. the animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. this is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy. charming, clever, fun and well made, what's not to enjoy?
