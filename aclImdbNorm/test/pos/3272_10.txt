i remember catching this film on a c4 screening a year ago and i was completely blown away by the whole thing. i thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres; the supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime, and so many more.<br /><br />i was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters. it made me feel terrified at one second for jimmy, and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next... and all the time i had my fingers crossed that things would work out for jimbo!<br /><br />heath ledger and rose bryne are superb, bryan brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up, along with david field, who was funny as well as being an evil git.<br /><br />since i saw this film i managed to order it on dvd and as a result, every person i show it to has been hooked in much the same way.<br /><br />this film is perfect for a sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, and it's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around.
