could this be one of the earliest colour films? it's actually the second. this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison. this was one of many of his other films.<br /><br />i think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films. it shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around, which turns red with the film. it's just beautiful.<br /><br />you are watching history when you watch this. you are watching what began to make movies of the day great! this may not have a plot, or anything very interesting, but this is the second colour film ever.<br /><br />i recommend this to everyone, especially if you're teaching students about filming or something of the sort, you have to show them what began color films!
