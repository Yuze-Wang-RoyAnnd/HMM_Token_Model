motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as bagdad cafe or repo man (which more or less takes place in the desert). it also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer joseph minion's comedy, 'after hours.' in a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, gus (played well by jordan christopher michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents. it begins as a trip through salvation (which is apparent in the scenes with john diehl), but once he becomes hooked on a scratch-off game called motorama, he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence. he travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting motorama cards from participating gas stations, just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a and be eligible for the $500 million cash prize.<br /><br />along the way, he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as flea who plays a high strung busboy, meatloaf who plays a crazy biker, and mary woronov and sandy baron (a seinfeld regular) as two violent kidnappers. <br /><br />the dvd rerelease can be very deceptive, as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market first with taglines comparing it to home alone and thelma & louise. the newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about jordan michael christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams...which, despite the size of her picture on the dvd cover, is actually only about a 1 second cameo by drew barrymore as the fantasy girl that gus dreams about. why didn't they just market it for what it was? thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing, it is actually a well-designed narrative. <br /><br />motorama is great material for fans of strange b-grade comedies. this was quite an interesting story, and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor--jordan michael christopher (who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note)--and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. hopefully its re-release on dvd will make it an easier find for cult fans.
