certainly this proves beyond a shadow of doubt that patricia arquette is what she is promoted to be: an actress! this is undoubtedly her finest moment of acting and she certainly deserves the credit for her work. never in any of her other movies, with the possible exception of holy matrimony, has she been totally believable and authentic.<br /><br />plot: a young woman finds herself in southeast asia and is suddenly thrown into the political havoc of the countryside. she witnesses mass murder and totalitarianism and escapes.<br /><br />it is one movie that you must see or you have not seen all of hollywood's finest. i rank it 58 in the top 100 films of all time.<br /><br />thanks bob
