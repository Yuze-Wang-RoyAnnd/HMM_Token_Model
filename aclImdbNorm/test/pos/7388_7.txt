dark harbor is a moody little excursion into murky emotional waters that run extremely deep. it's basically a 3-character piece, featuring a finely-layered performance by the always-great rickman, with polly walker and norman reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. a perfect late-night cable film, with a surprise ending to boot.
