this is a romantic, albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites. it is one of the many classics of the 80's genre like "pretty in pink" or "some kind of wonderful".<br /><br />nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl julie. it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end.<br /><br />true, most of the acting sucks but ...<br /><br />i have been in love with nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since. he's really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential.<br /><br />if you love 80's movies, you will love this classic.<br /><br />go rent it!!!!!
