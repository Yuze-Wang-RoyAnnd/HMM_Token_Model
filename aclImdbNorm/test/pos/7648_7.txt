didn't really know what to expect from this movie-and found myself being pleasantly surprised. i picked it up because i recently stumbled across norman reedus and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in.<br /><br />i'm not big into hustler movies or con movies, but i have to say, this one roped me in within minutes. probably because i couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who. this movie is stylish and fast-paced, with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances.<br /><br />while i was impressed with most in the film, i must say dagmara dominczyk was simply excellent.<br /><br />give it a chance-it's a really fun film.
