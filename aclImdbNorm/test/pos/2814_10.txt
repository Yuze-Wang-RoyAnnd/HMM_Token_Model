at initial thought, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag, just for stan lee's amusement. i expected nothing more than a sleazy, animated version of barb wire with low production values, much like those short pieces of crap you see on adult swim for short term amusement, but can never taken too seriously. boy was i wrong!<br /><br />stripperella has even better production values than similar marvel toons. the animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible.<br /><br />the humor is good too, on the sexy, suggestive and sleazy side. it is very similar if not exactly like the simpsons style. you may encounter clich'es and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless. if this were running today, i'd surely see it regularly. its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made.
