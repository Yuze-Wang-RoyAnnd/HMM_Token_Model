for the record, i am a curly fan through and through. but i do have to say that in reality, shemp wasn't really that bad. yeah, he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had, but in his own way he was hilarious. at least he wasn't as bad as joe besser.<br /><br />in brideless groom, shemp plays a music professor (stooge? a professor? yeah right), who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle, and moe & larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that night, or no money.<br /><br />this was one of the stooges' first skit with shemp, before they started recycling their material. perhaps it isn't surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture, so he seemed natural at this. the slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth. essential stooge short to be honest.
