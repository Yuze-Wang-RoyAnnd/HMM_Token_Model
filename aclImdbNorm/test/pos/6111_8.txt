"pink flamingos" was revolutionary for its time, and even today it's still hard to watch. not that i didn't enjoy the film, it's hilarious; but it's very repulsive and jonh waters pushes the envelope as far as it can go. the story concerns babs johnson (devine), she's the filthiest women alive. she lives in a trailer with her son crackers and daughter cotton. not to mention the overweight edie who's obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib. then there's connie and raymond marble, two filthy perverts who are jealous of babs. they long to outdo her in being the filthiest person alive. this means having their janitor impregnate kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples, flashing people in public, and even sending babs a turd in the mail. babs fights back to prove she's the most deranged person alive. which even includes incest, murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts. it's a film that's fun for the whole family. (well depending on where you live?) watch "pink flamingos", but don't forget your barf bag. for more perverse, weird sex and bodily functions also see "sweet movie".
