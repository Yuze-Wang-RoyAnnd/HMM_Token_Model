this is a fine, under-rated film and rip torn, well-known as he is, is a seriously under-rated actor. i read howard frank mosher's novel many years ago. how well craven captures the book and the beauty of vermont's northeast kingdom! i had the good fortune to grow up in vt in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the "irasburg incident" took place. i've not seen _stranger in the kingdom_, the craven/mosher collaboration based on the incident(and another mosher novel), but this film has inspired me to track it down.
