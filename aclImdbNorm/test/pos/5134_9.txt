in "hoot", mullet fingers is engaging in sabotage to stop the pancake house. the problem is that the builders just start over again, and he has to take more drastic measures. when he is confronted with the dogs, he scares them off with snakes, not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to hospital.<br /><br />roy at bedtime asks his father, who works with the department of justice, how he deals with crooks. his father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through papers, because sooner or later, they all slip up. you can see this with enron and worldcom. roy looks at documents relating to the pancake house, and finds a suppressed document (he does have to break in to the company trailer), so when the police see it, he has the law on his side. unlike when he evaded the police.<br /><br />mind you, as mentioned before, roy is not always law-abiding, and when the company man is killing owls (illegally), mullet fingers takes direct action. he can't wait for the law (mullet fingers is in hiding). the movie does suggest that one should work in the system.
