a very surprisingly underrated movie. very realistic. and authentic .with great dialogue. being italian, i can definitely relate to the situations and phrases used. i thought joe cortese was great. as a crazy mob cowboy type, and pesci and vincent were great also. i liked the actor criscuolo who played the boss. he was very authentic. i think the director ralph devito was on his way to great things , but was cut down too early , maybe because he knew too much. i thought it was great. it deserved more airplay and recognition. it was a sleeper movie. great. very good. it really had good authenticity. it was well done.
