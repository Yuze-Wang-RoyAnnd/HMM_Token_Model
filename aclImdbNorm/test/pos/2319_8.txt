the first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice!for me, its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel. i was born and raised in norfolk virginia and met my share of "different" sailors- i even married one! most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, not dependent on sex or violence and funny every time i see them. groundhog day, bruce almighty and down periscope are still funny even after i know the dialog by heart. kelsey grammar with his "god i love this job!"was sincere, genuine and lovable. rob schneider is hysterical as the crew gets back at him for being annoying. i am still amazed at the size of that fishing boat next to a sub! i can see why folks who live this life would notice the uh-oh's but its not a documentary after all its a comedy and i just love it!
