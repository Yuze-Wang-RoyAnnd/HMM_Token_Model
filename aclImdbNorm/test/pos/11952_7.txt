this is from much of the same creative team behind "better off dead", but is not quite as good as that amazing teen comedy. its a lot of fun, but its all over the place and just not quite as funny. curtis armstrong is used to less effect (he was incredibly funny in "better off dead", bobcat goldthwaite is hilarious, cusack is good, demi moore is demi moore (only with better hair here.) overall its fun, and as a person from cape cod, it catches the feeling of an 80s cape cod summer very effectively. for some reason, this film feels more "mainstream" than "better off dead". there isn't quite as much left field absurdity going on here. again, if you are a fan of john cusack and savage steve holland its definitely recommended.
