although the wonderful soda counter in the local drugstore no<br /><br />longer exists, and the clothes are definitely l946 immediate<br /><br />post-war vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, and<br /><br />those old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. <br /><br />the human adjustments and problems post-war, the beautiful<br /><br />love stories, the wonderful acting (especially harold russell and<br /><br />dana andrews) are as moving today in 2002 as they were in l946. <br /><br />i was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelous<br /><br />veterans home from world war ii. like so many, my memories of<br /><br />the war years and the homecomings are as fresh today as if they<br /><br />took place yesterday - this movie is very relevant for our times.
