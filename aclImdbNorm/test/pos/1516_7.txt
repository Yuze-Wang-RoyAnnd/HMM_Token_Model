i don't know what it is exactly, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf, with no thought of ever leaving me...fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well unique movies i've ever seen. not sure what else to say about it, but i love this movie!!! the steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious, and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...i'm not sure what fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that, based on this film, fulci accused wes craven of ripping him off with "scream"? "cat in the brain" is a must for bad movie lovers everywhere...yes i'll definitely say it's not a "good" film, but i guarantee certain scenes will stick in your mind forever! this is an exercise in craziness, people...i guess if i were a "serious" critic i'd give it a 3, but on sheer enjoyability (again i can't really explain my affections) i'd give it a 7....really whacked out flick...
