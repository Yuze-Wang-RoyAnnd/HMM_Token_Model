some major spoilers, you've been warned<br /><br />i saw this movie yesterday at venice's film festival, and i must admit that, being a fan, it was really impressive. excellent graphic, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action sequences and so on... but there's a but. all the film was thought exclusively for the gamers that have loved it, and that can therefore enjoy every single reference, character, inside joke (you should see a joke with winning music that's particularly comic) etc. a poor man not inside the world of ff will obviously see the magnificence of technical part, but cannot grasp the inner satisfaction of seeing, e.g., barret appearing and shooting bahamut totally out of nowhere. he'll ask himself, "who's this guy?", and i cannot blame him. he cannot even understand what a gamer feels when in the opening sequence there's game's opening music, nanaki running in the canyon with his two cubs, howling at midgar's ruins, and then "498 years ago...". almost all characters have made an appearance or quote (including reeve, tseng and elena), and reno & rude were really goofy and comic to see, but the final impression the movie left to me was "hardcore gamer's final dream, but far less for a movie fan...".
