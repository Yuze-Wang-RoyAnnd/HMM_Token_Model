martino, a young teacher in the island of elba, has been formed by maestro fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own man and to say whatever he thinks, something that gets him in trouble at the school where we first meet him because he is teaching revolutionary ideals. the island is in a frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in european history of the 19th century. napoleon is coming to his exile, not exactly a high point in his life.<br /><br />with surprise, martino is chosen to accompany napoleon who is writing his memoirs and is in need of help for his own project. the young man comes from a sea merchant family. his brother and sister want him to go on an commercial expedition, but martino has decided his place belongs in elba because he will try to assassinate napoleon. little deters him after his mentor fontanelli is tried for treason and condemned to be shot by a firing squad.<br /><br />martino finds his consolation with the much older baroness emilia, a beautiful woman. in his own interaction with the deposed emperor, a different kind of man emerges. napoleon is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of martino, not suspecting with the plans the young man's own plans for him. unfortunately, martino is not able to put his design into action because napoleon has other plans in mind.<br /><br />paolo virzi, the director of "caterina va in citta", shows why his early promise is still there. mr. virzi also collaborated with the screenplay, which is based on a novel by ernesto ferrero. the director shows he is as good in intimate drama as well as with this type of spectacle. alessandro pesci, the cinematographer, does an excellent job with the images he was able to get.<br /><br />elio germano, a young italian actor is the best thing in the movie. he is playing against more experienced players, yet he manages to convince us he is the idealist youth trying to get justice to what he perceives is a noble cause. the great daniel auteuil is a more subdued napoleon than one would expect from anyone's interpretation of this larger than life man. monica belucci is the love interest of martino, but she has little to do. omero antonutti plays fontanelli.
