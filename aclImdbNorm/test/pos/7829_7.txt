snakes on a plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week. reading the other comments here i see the results. a lot of people are mad. mad because it doesn't have the best special effects. mad because it doesn't have a star cast. mad because they wanted to see samuel jackson say "i'm sick of these m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing snakes on this m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing train"! <br /><br />well, this sure ain't the samuel jackson version. and maybe that's good.<br /><br />snakes on a plane was lost between cop film and horror, a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death. saturday night live performers got laughs while jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears, and as far as kids go, they would be traumatized by the violence.<br /><br />snakes on a train however knew exactly what it was. this was a cheaply made horror movie on a train. sure it had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects. but never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the "on a plane" version was tripping all over itself from the first scene on.<br /><br />i did enjoy the over the top fun that snakes on a plane had to offer and i admit that the "...on a train" version was a little dry. but hey, in trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did.<br /><br />for this it gets a 7 out of 10.
