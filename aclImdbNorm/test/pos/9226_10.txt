here's what you have to remember about this movie.... it's a kids movie!!!!! i don't know about the rest of you but i'm an 80s child. i was obsessed with rainbow brite. so, naturally i love this movie. but if you watch the other rainbow brite movies this one is by far the best. but, like i said, it's a kids movie. you have to judge it as a kids movie. it doesn't matter to kids if the acting, animation or script is fantastic or even good. all they care about is what happens to the characters. if the good guy (or girl) wins then it's a great movie. if not, then it's bad. you all know what i mean. you were all kids once.
