i decided to watch this on fearnet on demand for free because i figured well, nothing else looks enjoyable. and it turned out to be quite a good little horror surprise! the film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. after they decide to build a campfire in the woods, they begin to tell their spooky stories and the movie transitions to the events in the stories.<br /><br />the honeymoon- a newlywed couple traveling cross country in an rv to las vegas is terrorized when they park in a wooded area by evil beings that hunt by the full moon. (i won't spoil that for you!) the hook- amy smart and james marsden, (probably the most famous people in the movie besides beautiful christine taylor) play the young couple who come face to face with the maniac that has a hook for a hand in this most recognizable short.<br /><br />people can lick too- this is probably the scariest and most dark of the stories. a young girl chats with another girl on the internet, but it turns out that it's actually a man who is obsessed with her and he proceeds to break into the house when she's alone. this was really chilling.<br /><br />the locket- this is also a great story with glen quinn and jacinda barrett, who play a motorcyclist and a beautiful mute girl who are terrorized by ghosts from a previous century in a mysterious farm house. this was good but it was the weakest of the entries.<br /><br />the group around the campfire slowly develop their own terrifying experience in their segments between stories, and the end of this movie is surprising and really awesome! overall this is not bone-chillingly scary but it's certainly a great little guilty pleasure that horror fans alike would definitely find worthwhile!
