this movie have 4 parts and every is around 170 minutes long. its based on true story of life of joe bonanno and it is telling all how he did see. so in some events we can notice that we heard different about it. movie make you tied up for chair till the end, i think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row, and not notice i watched 2 in a row and 2 next day in a row. acting in movie is ok in some scenes awesome but in general could be bather, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor, this one show real thing and story is key to this movie. so the one who look for same spectacular rambo/matrix/titanic movie you can skip this one. good thing in movie is that follow the main story so you will not have long and boring love scenes or any different interrupt with something not important to crime business of bonanno.
