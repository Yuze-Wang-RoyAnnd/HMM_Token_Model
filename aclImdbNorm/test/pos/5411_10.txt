imaginary heroes is clearly the best film of the year. it was a complete and utter joy to watch. i was riveted. the whole audience up at the sunset five was riveted, when the film ended no one moved, spoke, nothing. i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has. especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama/ work of this younger generation. <br /><br />there were moments in your film, many, like at least seven, where i was struck by such a great amount of beauty, emotional beauty, that i actually couldn't breathe for a while. and for a catharsis junkie like me, that's about the best censorial experience i could ask for. it is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction. like heavyweight stuff, like burtolucci and those guys. <br /><br />each element of the film fit tightly together. there were no missteps at all. the cast was amazing. i have been a huge fan of emile's and ryan's for a long time, and i thought they have never been better. i was/am/will be continuously stunned by this film. and i promise i will drag every person i know to see it. it should be seen. it should win awards.
