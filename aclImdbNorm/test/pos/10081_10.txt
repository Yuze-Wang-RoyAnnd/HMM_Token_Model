is this a bad movie?<br /><br />of course, what were you expecting from a movie called "beach babes from beyond"?<br /><br />it is a "babes in bikini" movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise. given, this is not "a room with a view" or "schindler's list." if you wanted a film like "a room with a view" then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond. but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot, this is the one for you. this flick delivers on what it promises and then some. it is pure 100% adolescent fun.<br /><br />there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis. the movie was quite funny and great to watch. these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video.<br /><br />every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this. this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen. so unashamedly, i say again...if you are going to watch only one "babes in bikini" movie, this is it.
