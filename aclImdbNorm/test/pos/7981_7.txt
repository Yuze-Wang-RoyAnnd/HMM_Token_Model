this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped. though i will concede that the ideas behind "batman forever" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.<br /><br />apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out. apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series, i fail to understand how "batman returns" can be considered at all disappointing.<br /><br />true, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in "batman," a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film. yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.<br /><br />michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck (christopher walken, named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor), his partner-in-crime oswald cobblepot, the penguin (danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier's "richard iii"), and selina kyle, the catwoman (michelle pfeiffer), whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman. the four principals turn in excellent performances, especially walken and devito, while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.<br /><br />there are some intriguing concepts in this film. about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. there simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.<br /><br />nevertheless, this is a damn good film. i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton.
