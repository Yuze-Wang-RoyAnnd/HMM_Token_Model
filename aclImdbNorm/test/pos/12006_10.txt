probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime. although, it seems hard to believe, all of it happened, actually the reality was even worse than the movie. it resembles orwellian fiction, only this is no fiction. john hurt is excellent as always. yes, the screenplay is not full of action, but life is not either. plot is breathtaking. yes, people were shot, yes thousands of them. their 'crime' was that they wanted to leave communist 'paradise' without government authorization. at times the movie drives tears in your eyes. we need more movies like this to really appreciate what america provides for us. excellent movie, highly recommend! god bless our country, usa!
