what a great little film, lots of good roles from some random stars. basically there are these pot growers that get caught up in a comical adventure. at points the film makes you believe everyone is going to end up dead! which adds to the comedy. when the character of john lithgow (3rd rock) re-appears - its impossible not to imagine the trip, this may have caused, like a total paradox. the film is full of twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the end. billy bob thornton astronaut farmer) is brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is fairly similar in the fact he holds the family of pot growers together. everyone involved in this film should get a big thumbs up.<br /><br />as i say' the final scene is a dream; however a nightmare at the same time. i love it when hank azaria (carter) says at the end do you think we should do this every year? i felt my self wishing they would. <br /><br />i'm not going to say this film is good for everyone, but as a lover of stoner movies i give it 10/10. - my advice have a joint ready; kick back and enjoy!
