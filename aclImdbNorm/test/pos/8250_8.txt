a gem of a british caper-comedy. poor american schlub pinky green (richard jordan, playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one) gets out of a british jail and tries to go straight, but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends, headed up by a really nasty ivan (david niven in one of his last roles). pinky resists, but the lure of all that money is just too much for him. things unravel and reravel and it's all joyous to watch. jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same one twice - this one is just too lovable to hate. niven never played a slicker bad guy, oil all over. two fine actors we've lost that i wish we had back.
