david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!<br /><br />the cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! but the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!<br /><br />2001 had some great tv shows to our screen. but, in contrast to this documentary gem, they make them pretty lame! but to even boast this documentary series as the best tv series of 2001 just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainment!<br /><br />overall, this is the best tv series of 2001, with no competition, and, maybe, the best tv series of 2000s!
