well how can i categorise farscape without resorting to gushing superlatives? ok, here goes! the scripts are fantastic, with each episode offering so much entertainment, drama, humour and sheer watchability. the casting is perfect especially that of zhaan (the blue lady) played by virginia hey, each character has a depth that just isn't there on the star trek series.<br /><br />i think having an australian spin on the show makes this for me, australia has been knocking out quality films for years and farscape is no exception.<br /><br />i have only seen the first four episodes in uk order and they have a quality that makes each 45 minute show (in the uk) stand out more like a film than a weekly tv series.<br /><br />the episode that really does it for me is 'i, et' which turns the alien concept around where moya (a living ship, even the spacecraft has a great character) is forced to land on a planet that has yet to make 'first contact' and is surprisingly earth like and crichton meets a radio telescope operator and *he* is the 'little green man' to them. gripping stuff.<br /><br />in short the effects are great, the scripts are top quality and the main characters (not one of them really given any more importance than any other) are interesting, not always 'good' and well just excellent.<br /><br />roll on the second season!
