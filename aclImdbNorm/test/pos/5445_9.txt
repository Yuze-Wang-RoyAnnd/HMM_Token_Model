i completely disagree with the other comments! i too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable. robin williams is in top form. true, the tone is familiar, but it is williams of good morning vietnam: smart, funny, on point. after too many dark turns, williams is finally back to what he does best. the supporting actors give great performances, especially laura linney and chris walken. chris plays himself, as usual, but as the "agent" to the next president he was a delight each time on screen. lewis black plays only himself basically, but he is wonderfully well used here. there is also a fun turn by jeff goldblum. the movie is more than what the trailer suggests, as well. the movie is funny, but it is not a pure comedy as suggested. it has a bit of a thriller line, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
