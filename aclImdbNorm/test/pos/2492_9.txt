my curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which now has been released on dvd for the first time in the uk, has been more than rewarded. peter watkins has excelled himself in his audacity and technical skills. this pseudo-documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and up to date.<br /><br />the film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the us, when the government has increased its legitimized use of violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement reacts increasingly violent and radical. in order to deal with both this, the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training to riot police units, the government has introduced the so-called punishment parks. convicted 'criminals', mostly activists, are given the 'choice' to either be locked up in prison for years and years, or spend three days in one of these parks, where they either gain their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence. the situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations, however. it reminded me of a sort of realistic version of battle royale (2000).<br /><br />the film's structure is extremely effective and recalls parallels with cannibal holocaust, which is made almost 10 years later. both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked, even though aware of the fact that: this is a film. both confront us with the inherently violent nature of mankind, but where cannibal holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning (above all, it is an exploitation movie in every sense of the word) and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world, punishment park does just that.<br /><br />i have been profoundly impressed with punishment park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. maybe that says enough about the truth of its content, about the way power structures in this world function. i do not agree with the critique that watkins polarizes and stereotypes, because the movie depicts activists and the keepers of the legitimized power structures who are in reality as polarized as they are here. if they weren't, there would not be any conflict and therefore no change in our societies. in reality, confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, whether you place them between activists and establishment in latin america, russia or new york city. if these groups would not be polarized to these extremes, the activists would be part of the silent majorities that tacitly complain but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world.<br /><br />as peter watkins tells us in the introduction on the dvd, the actors in punishment park are for the most part amateurs. most kids were real activists from la, most policemen had been part of the national forces and even some of the members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of the time. not introducing both groups previous to the shooting of the scenes taking place in the improvised court room, adds to spontaneous and improvised feel. parallels are drawn with issues of the time, such as the repression of black panther members (one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the convicted charismatic bpleader bobby seale) and the trial of the chicago seven.<br /><br />i admire watkins' obvious and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern with human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (nowadays in the name of the war in terror) to silence those that do not agree and refuse to be brainwashed. punishment park remains to be an extremely important movie that should be shown in schools and seen by everybody who shares these concerns. maybe its marginalization can finally be made up for.
