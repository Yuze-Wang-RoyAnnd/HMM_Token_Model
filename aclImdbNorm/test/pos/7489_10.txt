one good thing: this hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end. an example of low-budget film making at it's best, writer/director skip woods uses seemingly everything he could find (ex: lamborghini, super model, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all of his camera set-ups.<br /><br />another good thing: this movie seems to be made for the dvd era, with several segments that comprise a larger story (similar to the work of tarantino and robert rodriguez's desperado). each "chapter" of the film features thomas jane's main character spending one day at home encountering quick and memorable performances by aaron eckhart, glen plummer, mickey rourke, michael jeter, james legros, and an unforgettable role by paulina porizkova.<br /><br />even another good thing: not exactly a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable... every person who sees this movie remembers one important scene. much as deliverance will always be remembered for it's awful rape of ned beatty, thursday will go down as the movie where a woman forcibly rapes an unwilling man. unforgettable.<br /><br />one bad thing: the title makes people think it is somehow related to (or derivative of) the "friday" series of films featuring ice cube.<br /><br />grade: a+
