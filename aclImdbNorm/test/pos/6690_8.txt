this film is brilliant...... without a doubt. watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which i am not), and thought it was quite good. but after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it is good.<br /><br />kevin spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and i really like jeff bridges (big lewbowski, blown away, arlington road). the film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. yeah right, you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth.<br /><br />that is how the story evolves with bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from prot, pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) a great film... that get's you wondering.....<br /><br />8/10 dave
