gary busey is superb in this musical biography. great singing and excellent soundtrack. the buddy holly story is a much better movie than la bamba. from reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. regardless, it is a fun toe-tapping film, and a good introduction to buddy holly's music.
