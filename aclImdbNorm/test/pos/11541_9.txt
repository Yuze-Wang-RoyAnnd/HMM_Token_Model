i'll put this as plainly as possible for those of you unaware of bill hicks' legacy. he was quite simply the greatest stand-up comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion the greatest that ever lived (his stand-up idol being the great richard pryor, whose battles with addiction he paralleled). his death in 1994 went barely noticed in the popular media, coming just weeks after kurt cobain had committed suicide. his tragic death at such a young age eclipses any sense of the injustice that he was criminally ignored during his life, of course. but the harsh truth is clear as day: nobody has stepped up to claim his mantle. there is not a stand-up comedian alive with nearly the skill and invention.<br /><br />the observation is made in the affectionate tribute `it's just a ride' that stand-up comedians often view the job as a stepping stone to richer pursuits - lame movies and morally-driven sitcoms, made to occupy - but never enrich - the lives of an unimaginative audience. it's everything that bill hicks spoke against. his sermon was always a rallying cry for people think for themselves, to scrutinise authority, to come together as one race.<br /><br />his appeal continues to grow with every passing year since his death. his star will continue to shine long after so many lesser lights have blew out. once you've been exposed to his brilliant, intelligent, but ultimately compassionate output, you will be enriched and rewarded.<br /><br />the man himself was fond to quote dylan: `to live outside the law you must be honest', he said. bill hicks was honest, beyond that he was the funniest of them all.
