i'm so happy i recorded this on vhs tape when it was featured on master piece theatre. this is a movie i can watch again and again. like living in the early 1800's in england isn't hard enough, prue is born with a "hare lip" and is outcast from birth. the people in her village accept her somewhat but always fear that she is "from the devil's smithy" and are quick to turn on her. especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family. she is strong and courageous but shies away from kester woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as lovely as a lily. kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart. the movie stays true to the original story by mary webb and is riveting from beginning to end.
