this is a great story. although there are some jimmy stewart cornball parts, for the most part it is a compelling tale about an individual with a compelling drive, vision and sense of adventure - to say the least. the bottom line is it is one of my favorites to watch and i've done so probably dozens to times -- that is until someone stole it our of a bag i brefly left on a plane on a flight to california!<br /><br />some have commented about too many flashbacks but i don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting. for those of us who actually fly, flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. i wouldn't have wanted to see the flight shortened at all. the oppressive need for sleep and the drone and surrounding loneliness is part of the story.<br /><br />there are many parts that i particularly like including the takeoff from long island and landing at night in paris (wow, things have really changed with us and the french since then!). the airplane building scenes and the record-breaking flight from san diego are interesting as is the incident over the atlantic in ice (which i understand is not completely true but did happen on the san diego flight).<br /><br />one gets the sense that one of lindbergh's biggest assets are his enlightened supporters as well as his persistence.<br /><br />some of the lines that ring in my head now and then include "pull the chocks!" on the takeoff scene and "i hope i don't have to use it that way" when describing the submarine-like "periscope" to the lady who lent him a mirror so he could better see his overhead instruments.<br /><br />this movie is not for everybody but it certainly is for me. i hope they make it on dvd soon so i can replace my stolen version!
