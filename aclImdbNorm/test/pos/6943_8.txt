although i lived in australia in 1975, i moved overseas not long after, fed up with constant industrial unrest, the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north. <br /><br />consequently i missed the dismissal, along with many other australian-made tv dramas of the '80s and '90s, such as the superb janus and phoenix series, which i have since seen, along with wildside.<br /><br />to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and, as far as i am aware, accurate. however, as to public "outrage" it only shows one side of the picture, not how families were riven by the controversy. i know, as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward. <br /><br />but the commentary is, in my view, very one-sided throughout. the inescapable fact is that, notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community, the australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favour of fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /><br />this apart, a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama.
