i'm seldom partial to movies about smart-assed teenagers who have problems with authority, but "toy soldiers" has grown on me with repeated viewings. this is as much a movie about billy tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else, and i give credit to sean astin and writer/director daniel petrie jr. that they don't make a big deal of that, but let it just unfold and sneak up on you. the camaraderie of tepper's friends, their grief over joey's death, and their joy at their survival, all are genuinely moving. and, i have to admit, i take a certain patriotic (and perhaps slightly reptilian) glee when the u.s. army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narco-terrorist butt. ooh-rah, general kramer! and the heroic robert folk score is the cherry on top. i'm sure i could find a hundred reasons not to like "toy soldiers," but as long as we don't take it too seriously, i don't see the need. this is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
