i really enjoyed north and south very much. i think it is one of the best and most lavish television series i have ever seen. the calibre of the cast is amazing, you have actors from "the golden age of cinema", people like james stewart, gene kelly, elizabeth taylor, robert mitchum and jean simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80's like patrick swayze, james read, jonathan frakes, genie francis, philip casnoff and lesley-anne down.<br /><br />at the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men,there is orry main (patrick swayze) who is from the south and george hazard (james read) who is from the north. throughout the series, their friendship is continually threatened with the differences in their backgrounds, particularly about the treatment of slaves in the south (especially at orry's plantation) but when each needs the other, they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend. i really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war.<br /><br />i liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so the audience could see what were the factors that lead up to the war, what was going on at the time, then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to rebuild the country again. the war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me.<br /><br />i think what is great about it, is it has so many elements running through it, romance, history, battles that would interest most of the audience, there is something for everyone. i particularly enjoyed the romance between brett (genie francis) and billy (parker stevenson/john stockwell) especially when she stood up to her sister ashton for the first time. the other romances were interesting as there were not all the same, each had something different to the others which kept me watching particularly the madeline and orry story strand to see if they would be together in the end.<br /><br />it is one of the best american mini series that i have watched, the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious history side that was happening in the country at the time but it is paced just right. the characters are very watchable and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the start and end of the episode is so toe-tapping good and works with the mood of the story.
