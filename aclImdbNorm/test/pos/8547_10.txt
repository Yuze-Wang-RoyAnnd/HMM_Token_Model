i saw this movie years ago and i never forgot it. the theme is very timely. it was on tcm this morning and i am wondering why this wonderful film is not on vhs or dvd. i have searched extensively for this movie but cannot find it. i believe that if enough people request it, the movie will ultimately be put on dvd. it amazes me that such a stunning performance from quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. the fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike. this film is a great teaching tool from the past yet in many ways as contemporary as "crash". from previous comments i can see that this film as made deep impressions on everyone. again, too bad it is not available for sale.
