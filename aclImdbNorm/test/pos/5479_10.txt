this is s superbly crafted top-notch washington thriller directed by the talented wolfgang petersen with hotshot screenwriter jeff maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years, so maybe he tends his roses). the film has clint eastwood as an ageing secret service agent and john malkovich as a vengeful assassin pitted against each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity, where the president's life is at stake. unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the president, which is an authentic touch. this film was made when both eastwood and malkovich were at their peak. probably eastwood has never done a better job than he does here, and it is all so effortless for the old pro. there are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs along beside the president's car as a bodyguard, for which he is too old. i wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added. my 'guardian angel', whose name is vigil, enjoyed this movie even more than i did, but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing. rene russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for eastwood, as she is so unobvious but so talented, and she shines. the tension is taut every inch of the way in this story, and the psychological struggles of eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting. with eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter, watch out! of course, he is the master of the super-cool. malkovich has the opportunity to indulge all the creepiness he could wish in the paranoid character he portrays, and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection. what a good 'un.
