if you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time. oversentimental in places? sure, of course it is - and proud of it. it is the biggest and best ride in the carnival and should be enjoyed as that. <br /><br />big production values, simple telling, with creative shots: it is not complex, is a very nice and remarkably sweet film. it really feels like a labor of love from bill paxton; and i bet his son gets that.<br /><br />the build-up is slow enough to be enjoyed, the conflicts feisty, and the british vs. americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore. i have minor gripes: the score wants to be james horner but is too overblown, and there are too many close-ups, and panning shots for 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent, and good-looking sports film then this is it.<br /><br />so here's the thing, and i feel like i know my film, but i actually liked it more than seabiscuit: which is a better film, but greatest story is simply disney at its core and hugely enjoyable! thanks, bill.
