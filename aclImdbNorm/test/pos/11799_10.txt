so glad i have hbo right now. i didn't plan on watching a movie today, but when i got home and saw that the next movie on hbo was this one i decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. i'm so glad i decided to watch this movie! maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (i'm a little stressed out, got a huge test to be studying for), but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. i'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me!<br /><br />anyhow, i just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed. there is definitely something for everyone in this movie!
