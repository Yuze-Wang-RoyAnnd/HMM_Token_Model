this is an adaptation of a dirk wittenborn book, which i did not read. young finn earl lives with his mom liz (diane lane) in a cramped lower east side new york apartment. he dreams of joining his anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in south america. liz has boyfriends and does coke. when he is caught scoring coke for her, one of her customers (liz is a legitimate masseuse) a rich mr. osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in new jersey. they are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing. (this and a few low-cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of ms. lane. some may be disappointed but i'm sorry she had to do all that stuff in "unfaithful" to make the a-list. that lady has more talent in her little finger than streep, roberts, and sally field do in their entire bodies and its time she was given her due.) when they arrive finn makes friends with osbornes grandson bryce, and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend, granddaughter maya. liz meanwhile joins aa and dates an aa doctor. she miraculously cleans up instantly. finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends. bryce seems like an ok guy but gets jealous when osborne takes finn on a hot air balloon race instead of him, and this leads to tragedy.<br /><br />the genius of the story, (and movie) is that they cut from the violent acts of the fierce filthy rich blysdale tribe to the yanomano warriors. it's a little implausible though that when liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from osborne and does not either contact the authorities or settle it thelma and louise style. there are elements of a gothic romance with a revelation by the village idiot. also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to blysdale. liz, for instance, like lane's pearl kantrowitz in "walk on the moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with finn at 18 and felt trapped. this is in the book but not the movie. still, these are minor shortcomings. the movie will be in full release 12/31/05 over a year after the original release date, and i just couldn't wait.<br /><br />there were lots of red carpet moments in the theater i saw the movie at, with almost the whole cast...except diane lane!! $#%#q$ director dunne said she was off filming a movie. i know she didn't promise to be there, but i came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person. the movie is a definite best picture contender, as for acting?? sutherland was quite good, and so was the boy who played finn. lane was magnificent as always, but i only recall one or two emotional scenes, when she catches finn with drugs "lets get f****d up together mother and son" and with osborne "your twisted grandson...". she would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way. unless they give it to her for a "body of work."
