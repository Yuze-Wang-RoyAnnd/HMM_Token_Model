you can't take this movie seriously.....the plot is predictable and trite, the acting often over the top, the dialog laughable; but it all adds up to great fun! three "career girls" in the late 1950's find their way to the big city and all the evils and temptations their mothers probably warned them about: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc.<br /><br />then there's amanda farrell (joan crawford) who did succeed professionally, but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door.<br /><br />this movie may have been believable 50 years ago, but now it's just great campy fun! rent/buy it and enjoy.
