my friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. the only good that came from it was this movie, "take it to limit" right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. the music is probably done by rural white boys from colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. the star of the show, actor leo fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie. this movie is based on climbing, and i'm not a climber, yet even i think it's hilarious when they have the climber struggling to climb and there's a guy in the background who is basically walking up the 'cliff'. you don't want to miss this movie, you'll get to see the same clips over and over again. you'll get surprises at every turn. you'll find yourself quoting the unforgettable lines. i highly recommend this movie to anyone. take it snow. disclaimer: this movie is poorly done, but that is what makes it great
