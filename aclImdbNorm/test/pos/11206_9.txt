when you're watching distant you know you're not watching a french movie, there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations, just to let you make sense of what's going on. it doesn't look american either, there aren't any car chases or shoot-outs or violence, unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe. at times, the relatively long-held medium-distance shots may remind you of 'contemplative' asian cinema, but just reminds you, the director doesn't push things to the radical minimalism of some taiwanese filmmakers but then again, this is not a taiwanese movie, it's a turkish movie. i don't know what that means, i don't even know if that's supposed to mean something.<br /><br />the movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet, those few lines, those somewhat long-held shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening, a sense of 'plot', for lack of a better word, that grows on you. by the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart.
