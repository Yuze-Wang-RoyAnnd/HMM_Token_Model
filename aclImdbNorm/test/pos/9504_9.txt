"icky flix" is an excellent starting point for anybody with even a vague interest in the residents. most of their classic videos are present (although "earth vs. flying saucers" and "don't be cruel" are curiously missing), and the "concentrates" of their various cd-rom projects offer tantalizing glimpses into how the orbed ones have been spending their time since they realized mtv was no longer putting them in heavy rotation (or, indeed, showing videos period).<br /><br />all of the videos on this compilation feature striking imagery and idiosyncratic music (with a choice of the original tracks and newly-recorded ones). and two of them -- "the third reich 'n' roll" and "one minute movies" -- are in the museum of modern art's permanent collection. check out this dvd and find out why.
