you can't watch this film for a history lesson. this was the first i had heard of the ma barker saga, but i could tell almost immediately that the facts were way off. and with a little internet research i realized i was of course right. ma barker sure as hell isn't the sexy, calculating woman the movie portrays her as, and apparently did not orchestrate all the bank robbing schemes, kiddnappings, and murders that her criminal boys carried out.<br /><br />but don't expect a brilliant crime drama. the script and the acting are adequate, the gunfights are excessive and mostly unrealistic, and there is a very laughable slow motion death scene. so why did i give it a 7 out of 10?<br /><br />because it was damn entertaining. the gunfights are fun to watch but there are some deeper themes that emerge between them. the movie has a strong sense of ego intimidation among it's cast of alpha males, each of whom has his own agenda. and i appreciate the minimal use of swears for the period. the set pieces are great, reproducing a convincing 1930s era.<br /><br />so watch this film like you would a cult film, and take the excessive bloodiness and ruthlessness in stride with the cheesy ultra serious comments from the fbi man who wants to take the barkers down at any cost. inotherwords, don't take it too seriously, just have fun with it. and if you like this, you'll love serial mom.
