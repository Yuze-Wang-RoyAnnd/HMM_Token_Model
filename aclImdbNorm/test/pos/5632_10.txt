this may actually the finest film of 1999. no i'm not kidding. this documentary directed by chris smith captures the very spirit of artistic compulsion. smith does the smart thing any documentary filmaker should do: he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /><br />as the viewer watches mark and his efforts, no matter how funkily aggressive they may prove, to finish his films. he refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result. but lest we forget, remember speilberg, scorsese and others started just as humbly.<br /><br />and what a great subject he chooses. mark, his family and friends are all fascinating characters, far more than any character created in last year's fictitious cinematic products.this film oscillates on the dime between comedy, tragedy, touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create, despite talent issues, to get off their butts and make something.<br /><br />the film is about maverick artists and their passions. it is also about families, no matter how co-dependent and disfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is. mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams, but also to his family as well- and they to him. <br /><br />why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal (that is assuming it was eligible last year). this film is to be sought out and treasured.
