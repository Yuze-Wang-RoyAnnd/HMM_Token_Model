black scorpion is roger cormen's batman. which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie. like the breathtaker being a cross between doctor doom and darth vader, that's kind of cool. the mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the mad hatter. the cormen b-movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing. there are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy. this movie, the good out weighs the bad. but if you aren't one for comic book movies, then i would advise not watching black scorpion, however if you like comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic before. then check out black scorpion, as for me i give it 8 stars.
