this film is full of interesting ideas. some scenes are truly hilarious. the dialogs are witty and colloquial. the tension in the film comes not so much from the 'murder mystery' plot as from the relationship between the characters. the film tells two stories in parallel.<br /><br />the first story involves the characters played by trintignant and kassovitz. trintignant is an ageing drifter, with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness, who is followed by a naive young man played by kassovitz with plenty of good-natured smiles. many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example when trintignant tries to teach kassovitz how to be intimidating.<br /><br />the second story tells how a salesman,played by jean yanne, gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony. i wish i could describe this better.<br /><br />after a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end, in a surprising but also logical ending.<br /><br />the film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director's father (the celebrated michel audiard) used to write, and the "typical french film" with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions.
