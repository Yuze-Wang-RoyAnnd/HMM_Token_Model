todd sheets has created one of the greatest low budget zombie movies ever. the story is great, the gore is grand, the psychos are wicked! yet the movie is flawed by its petty dialogue and sluggish imaging at times.<br /><br />despite this zb2 delivers what any zombie movie should, gore, good plot, fast pace adventure into the macarbe. if only mr sheets had been given a 100k budget this movie would out do every zombie movie ever even the almighty dawn of the dead.<br /><br />but as time goes by he gets better and as he gets better more money comes into his pocket. thus allowing this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better.<br /><br />just remember that zombie bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he is atop of gore mountain
