there were heist movies before this one, and indeed the likes of rififi were an obvious influence on it - but the red circle is more than just another entry in an overpopulated genre and with this film, director jean-pierre melville has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about. being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and melville delivers that with this film in droves; the tone of the film is very relaxed too and melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior. the story has a number of angles but the central character is corey - a thief who is released from prison. his release coincides with the escape of infamous murderer vogel, who slips from under the nose of police commissioner mattei during a train ride. the first thing corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss rico, and the second thing he does is recruit vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist. but rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails...<br /><br />the film is bolted together by four excellent central performances. alain delon is calm and calculating as the film's anti-hero, while gian maria volont`e looks formidable in his role as the escaped murderer. francois p'erier is good also as a dubious club owner, while the real standout performance comes from andr'e bourvil in his role as the police commissioner. the film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride. however, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. the film does feature crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. the first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end. rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word. the heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless, and i have to say that i preferred the scene in rififi; but melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it. the film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely. overall, this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow; but the red circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
