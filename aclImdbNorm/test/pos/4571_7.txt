if this film is examined closely, it's a bit sad. it is detailed enough to touch upon very real problems children, who grow up in poor, dysfunctional environments. yet, it retains it's comedic value, with spirited performances by diahann carroll and james earl jones. the sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother (carroll), who cannot truly help her children, not because she doesn't want to, or try, but because, it's obvious she doesn't know how. remember, this is a comedy, but if you've never seen this, or if you have, watch this film and see the humanity, in the characters. good film.
