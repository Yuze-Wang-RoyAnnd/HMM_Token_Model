beautiful, emotional, and subtle. i watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a film room with 95% of senior citizens. i wish bigger cinema like lowes around here would show it. great cinematography by wong and christopher doyle. since i understand cantonese, it's a lot easier for me to understand the movie. as simple as the story goes, many english speaking viewers didn't get the whole story. three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no clues about the movie.<br /><br />spoiler; they were surprise when i mention that mr. chow did sleep with mrs chen and they have a son. she went to singapore trying to tell him but didn't.<br /><br />spoiler<br /><br />the mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery like moment or memory. the phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. the whole movie pretty much fit the title. not to mention the flowery "cheung sam".<br /><br />my favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley. it looks so beautiful, the sun shining on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, truely a poetic moment. i felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly. i felt a terrible heartache when mr chow was rehearsing his departing moment, and mrs chen cried on his shoulder.... bravo wong kar-wai!<br /><br />as much as i like this one, chungking express still top my favorite. however, i'll give this one a 10 as well. as a point of reference, cthd only got 7.<br /><br />if you love art, you will love this movie. don't miss it.
