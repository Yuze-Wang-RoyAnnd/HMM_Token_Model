excellent special effects make this disaster move very plausible. one can see that the producers went to some trouble to get the displays on the computer screens just right - it all makes it very convincing. the sets are also very authentic looking. a good choice of music rounds off the film nicely.<br /><br />acting is good and the presence of david suchet adds some weight to the cast of course. compared to other movies of this genre, flood is right up there with the best of them. thankfully, the "human drama" aspect has not been overdone, as is often the case with this type of movie. the human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the actual flooding scenes.<br /><br />and of course, the movie confirms what many of us suspect anyway: weather forecasters so often do not get it right! :)
