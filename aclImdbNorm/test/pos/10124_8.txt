inspired by true events, radio is one of the best acted, heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime. it definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003. <br /><br />radio stars ed harris, who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film, as football coach harold jones. coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew. one day radio, played by cuba gooding jr., in his best performance since men of honor, comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. some members of the team, then tie up radio and throw him into a building. they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong. he comes over and helps radio, who is frightened, and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond. radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events. he also becomes coach jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio.<br /><br />the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death, and family relationships. the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael tollin should be very proud of this film. the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt. the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes. radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad. <br /><br />in conclusion, i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews. they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. also the performances as i mentioned before are top-notch and oscar worthy. in my opinion, both ed harris, who i think is underrated as an actor, and cuba gooding jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie. radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies. my final rating for radio is a 9/10.
