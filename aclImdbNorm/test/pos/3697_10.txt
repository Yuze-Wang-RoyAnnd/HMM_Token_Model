this movie is excellent the passion between jade & billy is memorable and the acting was great, this is why you don't leave a 16 year old and a young man like that alone together! it shows why a single mother shouldn't date a younger man with a teen aged daughter in the house, cause he looked young enough to be jessy's son.<br /><br />i give it ten out of ten, the acting was wonderful and the movements between the actors was correct.<br /><br />the age difference between jenny and rob was good too, because they were similar in age.<br /><br />overall, its a fun movie but i think nobody under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes.
