one of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film, because i thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.<br /><br />first of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. but when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway. it's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer, and if we do, it's usually some boring terrible film.<br /><br />this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore, because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasn't pleased with but other than that it's still a great movie.<br /><br />all in all you'll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it, you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it's totally not what you'd expect.
