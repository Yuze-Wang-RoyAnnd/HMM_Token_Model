in the late eighties and early nineties the decline and death of independent video companies like vestron and media effectively shut off italian horror films for much of it's american audience. coincidently(?) italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability.<br /><br />occasionally movies like primal rage, "sequels" like beyond the door iii, troll 2, and a few dario argento films limped out onto video but most remained unreleased (until dvd) in the us for nearly a decade or longer. movies from these lost years became very sought after and talked about among horror fans.<br /><br />of these films, cat in the brain is probably one of the most hyped of all due to the legions of lucio fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed by but also starred their idol, fulci himself.<br /><br />though not quite fulci's best, it's still better than most of his later efforts. his rabid fan-base will probably love it. italian horror and giallo aficionados might also enjoy it, depending on their tastes but i'm not sure about anyone else. people who only watch hollywood stuff might not want to take the word of the many glowing reviews here.<br /><br />one thing i personally found fascinating were the scenes featuring probably benito mussolini's only lasting contribution to italy, cinecitta studios. the name is instantly recognizable to any fan of italian movies. until i saw it here, i could only imagine what it looked like.
