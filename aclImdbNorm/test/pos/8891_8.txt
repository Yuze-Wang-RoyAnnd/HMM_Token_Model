larry donner (billy crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (kate mulgrew) stole his book and left him, he has a new budding romance with a girl named beth (kim greist), he doesn't know how to start his book, and his students of his screen writing class are stranger than most. however, one student (danny devito) is extra strange. he lives with his evil momma (anne ramsey) and he can't get up the courage to kill her. so than he goes to larry for help, making his life go from normal crazy, to extra crazy! <br /><br />stu silver should have done more! the dialog, the characters, the whole script is near perfect! and danny devito has proved to me he's more than a great actor: he's a great director! his kid's movie matilda is among my favorite family movies and now this is one of my favorite comedies.<br /><br />it's a black comedy, most jokes are about murder, but it's damn funny! all of the actors are doing their full potential, whether they're main characters (billy crystal) or just one-bit minor characters (olivia brown).<br /><br />if you like comedy (who doesn't?) than you'll like this! 8/10 stars.
