i thoroughly enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot which he re-shot later in his career. possibly the most amazing thing about it, however, is how faceless the lead characters are. after watching, one remembers murray alper as the jovial truck driver, vaughan glaser's touching turn as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow bob cummings as the rather wooden fugitive (compare that bridge jump to harrison ford's similar stunt in andrew davis' "the fugitive") and priscilla lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards cummings is never quite believable.<br /><br />the other major support player is, of course, hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. my feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement.<br /><br />obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the second world war, but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.
