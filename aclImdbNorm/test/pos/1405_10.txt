a brash, self-centered army cadet arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the corps.<br /><br />in a role obviously tailor-made for him, william haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. a grade-a scene stealer, haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual silly billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. the last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents. if west point does not quite reach the caliber of haines' previous tell it to the marines (1926), this is doubtless due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma & quality of lon chaney for haines to interact with. however, this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merit.<br /><br />joan crawford appears as haines' love interest, playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper. joan is pert & pretty and especially shines in her first scenes, when she meets haines on a hudson river ferry and is subjected to his usual immature antics. haines & crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life. he was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in hollywood. a superstar herself by the early 1930's, she reciprocated after his ouster from mgm in 1932 by encouraging his career change to interior decoration.<br /><br />little william bakewell is effectively cast as a plebe who idolizes haines; their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of haines & crawford.<br /><br />the film was made with the full cooperation of the war department. extensive location filming at the academy helps tremendously with the production's ambiance, which was given splendid production values by mgm.<br /><br />west point has been recently restored and given a rousing new score by david davidson.
