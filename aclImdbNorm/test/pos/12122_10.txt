just got this in the mail and i was positively surprised. as a big fan of 70's cinema it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of flicks. despite the obvious low budget on this movie, the acting is overall good and you can already see why pesci was to become on of the greatest actors ever. i'm not sure how authentic this movie is, but it sure is a good contribution to the mob genre.....
