when i fist watched the movie, i said to myself, "so a film can be made like this." wong kar wai's gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film. i must admit this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all, i have ever watched. the content and the form overlaps perfectly. as watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings. beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable. i want to congratulate christopher doyle and pin bing lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love. also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. and of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. eventually, all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of wkw and give the audience the feeling called love.
