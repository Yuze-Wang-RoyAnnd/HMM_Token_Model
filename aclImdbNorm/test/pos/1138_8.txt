ten years before "the matrix" and hot on the heals of "they live" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. if you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, david lynch meets john carpenter style movie-making you'll love "split". there are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. the plot involves a man named starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream. similar to "they live", "1984" and "the matrix", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy big brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city. this is all revealed pretty early on in the plot. possible spoiler: starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality. along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. i challenge anyone to not be rewinding, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.
