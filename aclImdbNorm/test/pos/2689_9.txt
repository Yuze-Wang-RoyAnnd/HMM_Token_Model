i'm not really a t.v. watcher - except between the ages of 6 and 8 and "general hospital" still had luke and laura - but there are a few exceptions and i definitely think that "king of queens" is one of them. every decade has it's classics and i think that this show will (or damn-well should) be amongst this decade's best. its comedic timing is awesome and can, at times, be down right odd. on a more 'serious' note the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle - and not so subtle :)- complexities in their characters without getting too hokey. one commenter wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to get into it and i agree; it's definitely one that kind of grows on you but once you're in, you're pretty much hooked. and with good reason!
