watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by dean r. koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way. the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers, the one difference is the main character travis. in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts. i'm a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. the oxcom costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trained.<br /><br />the film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab, a dog and a monster. both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them. the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog einstein, meanwhile the oxcom is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes, two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way, so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the oxcom are not far behind.<br /><br />watchers is not a great adaptation of dean r. koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.
