this movie is so cool. it told me to enjoy every moment in life to its fulness. i think that bonnie hunt (jerry maguire) writes well and i am so happy that she gave aging actors opportunity to have such big roles in the movie. that is really neat, in a society that worships wealth, health and youth, it was nice to see a movie about normal people. the movie reminded me a lot of "while you were sleeping" which i really love. if you don't like this movie you should work on your sensitivity skills.<br /><br />favorite quotes: megan dayton: "i'm just saying, for safety, don't shave your legs,because then you definitely won't let it go too far." grace briggs: "megan, it's a first date." megan dayton:" i married a first date. i'm sure you plan on being level-headed, but once you're in the moment, the male brain seems, i don't know, everything they say suddenly seems brilliant. hairy legs are your only link to reality." favorite scenes: megan (good will hunting) riding her bike. all the scenes in the garden. the conversation and comradery among the grandpa and friends in the restaurant. please do not miss this movie it will warm up your heart!
