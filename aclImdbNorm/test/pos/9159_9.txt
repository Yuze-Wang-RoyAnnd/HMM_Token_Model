nbc was putting out a lot of good product when this series came out, but none of it was getting viewers. at least according to their executives who wisely canceled good shows like star trek & my world & welcome to it because of low ratings. nbc's advertisers were getting a bargain from nbc's ignorance.<br /><br />this show stands out as the only time james garner wasn't enough to get viewers. it is ashame as this show had an excellent support cast from stuart margolin (later angel in the rockford files), to neva patterson to margot kidder.<br /><br />it was set in a 1900 western town. garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to do his duties. it was small town stuff, but it was excellent. it wasn't long after this that jim rockford brought garner back to success, but for my money, this show was good enough, it just wasn't in the right time, right place, or given the right opportunity.<br /><br />the show was so good that most of the folks who worked on it also got jobs on rockford.
