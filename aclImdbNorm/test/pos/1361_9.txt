golden boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there. a sexy comedy, about a young man quest to find his nitch in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it! its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name, but once viewing it...will fall for the comedy/silliness that lies inside. truly a crime that only produced 6 ova episodes and pilot movie were made. however, being unique as it is. i'm surprised it survived to produce that many. if you want a good laugh, with high quality anime that is (100% cgi free), check this anime out. boy who one day may save the world....or maybe not.
