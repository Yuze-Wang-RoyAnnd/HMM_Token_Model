oliver stone is not one to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter. he is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. look on his cv for proof! this movie is not an exception, quite on the contrary, it is another gem, that unfortunately not many have seen.<br /><br />as controversial movies go, this is one that you should be thankful for. a movie that should encourage you to think about you, the people next to you. the prejudices that do exist and that everyone of us has in one form or another. either we like to admit it or not, but it is easier to categorize people and be like "ah he's 'xyz', yeah he must be like ...". now i might be reading too much into it, but i don't believe that. i believe that oliver stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aiming for those things. and if that's something you want to explore (as a movie or within yourself), than watch this film and be excited!
