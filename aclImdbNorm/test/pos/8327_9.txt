if you haven't seen this yet, you really should, on dvd. i can't believe how much i enjoyed it! it is amazingly realistic and believable. true, much of it is speculated, and i would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts (there aren't many of them), but it handles everything quite well with a "cruel mother nature" theme. it will remind you of the nature programs that you've seen on animal planet and the discovery channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. they act natural; they eat, kill, mate, play, and fight for survival. you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others.<br /><br />for the most part, the effects are excellent. at times they will look a little too much like cgi's, but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic. in some cases, you will actually be convinced that you've seen a dinosaur. my favorites were the coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. i was most disappointed with the t-rex, however, which looked a little too computer generated at times.<br /><br />in any case, you should definitely see this production. it is educational, well made, and very entertaining. for what it is, its an a!
