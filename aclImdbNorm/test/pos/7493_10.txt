this film is hard to knock. it follows in the tradition of pulp fiction, yet succeeds further by stamping its own unique style. the cast is awesome, the script is great - and things like the odd (pulp fiction-esque) time-sequencing is done brilliantly. i particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time. when it is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool, but when it is the hero's recollection everything is skanky and disgusting.<br /><br />this is an awesome film - and so i am extremely annoyed to find that i cant buy it anywhere!
