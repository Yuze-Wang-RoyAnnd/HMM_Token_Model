if you find the first 30 minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. also, hearing the danish language is a bit new to most north americans, who don't see and hear a lot of danish films. anyway, as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his/her patience.<br /><br />being a fan of the movie, "out of africa," this film piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by isak dinesen (karen blixen), the major character in that film.<br /><br />the meal - babette's feast - was amazing. i'm no chef, but i was impressed! how one interprets the story, too, varies, i suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise. if the latter, how you look at the definition of "legalism" can affect how you interpret this story.<br /><br />in any case, it's a fine film, but don't watch this if you're dieting.
