i loved this film. it manages to make the characters sympathetic (well, most of them) concerning the problems they have with their relationship.<br /><br />gloria swanson, as leila, is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices her presence (though he does notice her absence). the film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a sweet-talking con man, without making her selfish or demanding. the reaction shots of leila at the dinner table on her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late to dinner again) eats salted scallions with gusto and pushes bride-and-groom dolls out of the way of his plate, are perfect.<br /><br />the show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by elliott dexter as jim, leila's neglectful husband. after losing leila to another man, jim literally cleans up his act, shaving off his mustache, working out to lose the middle-aged spread, and dressing neatly. there are several shots of jim at home, lonely and thinking of leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet. the film gives the audience the advantage of watching jim's transformation along with leila. it isn't just the exterior that's more attractive; we come to know much more about the kind of person jim really is, and we see how completely different he is from leila's second husband, schuyler (lew cody). dexter shines as the before-and-after jim, who is determined, after discovering schuyler's true character, to win leila back, if he can. the film's most touching moment comes when jim and leila discover that they are standing under the mistletoe, and jim talks of what he has lost.<br /><br />definitely worth watching.
