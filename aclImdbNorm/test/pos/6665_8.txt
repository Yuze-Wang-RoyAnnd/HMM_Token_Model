i really enjoyed this both times i watched it. and both times, i walked away thinking about it, and the "morals of the story" a great deal. i agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not centred around the sci-fi aspects you might expect from an alien-on-earth movie, but rather is about the human condition. the characters in the psych hospital provide a great insight in to that, and how they go from hopelessness to hope. this movie has touches of sadness to humour to sympathy to the final "is he or isn't he". that final question was well handled and even though some might argue you don't know what happens in the end and the question goes unanswered, i feel it is done in far more detail than something wishywashy like say, the movie ronin (with robert de niro) where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it. i highly recommend k-pax. 8/10
