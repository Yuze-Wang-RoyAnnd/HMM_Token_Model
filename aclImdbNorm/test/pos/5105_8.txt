caught this 1969 film on cable tcm one night. i remember when i first saw the film in hong kong, i really enjoyed the songs and performances by peter o'toole and petula clark. i love clark best in francis ford coppola's "finian's rainbow" (1968) opposite fred astaire, don francks and tommy steele. simply ecstatic to learn that finally, this delightful irish-flavored pot of gold musical is released on dvd! ah, "it's that old devil moon (in your eyes)." <br /><br />peter o'toole as mr. chips - yes, he did sing - quite a deliverance. he may not be a veteran at musical like rex harrison, but he inhabited the role marvelously. the scene of him running across the lawn in his cape a-flying reminds me of the pbs series, "to serve them all my days" - a lovable schoolmaster and loving man, he is, 'mr. chipey.' clark and o'toole somehow gave us just the right mix of spunk and circumstance. the songs and lyrics by leslie bricusse are catchy as usual. the tunes of "you and i" and "walk through the world (with me)" stayed with me the most all these years. and there's "what a lot of flowers," "and the sky smiled," "fill the world with love" - not syrupy at all. sometimes i think if the world is immersed in bricusse's songs and words, we would overcome all strife on earth and 'lovely' will be all our days! yes, "talk to the animals," too. ("doctor doolittle" 1967) <br /><br />musicals are a blessing to the world of moviegoers, they are somehow larger than life. like the music and lyrics by the sherman brothers (richard m. and robert b.) who gave us "chitty chitty bang bang" (1968) and "mary poppins" (1964) - who wouldn't feel absolutely delighted simply uttering "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? i was tickled by even just one featured song & dance number in the spanish film "km.0 - kilometer zero" (2000). my all time favorite is french filmmaker jacques demy's "young girls of rochefort" (1967) with colorful cast of catherine deneuve and (late sister) francoise dorl'eac, jacques perrin, michel piccoli, danielle darrieux, gene kelly and george chakiris singing, dancing to michel legrand's music. long live musicals.
