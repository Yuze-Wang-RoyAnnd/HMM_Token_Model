there are few films that deal with things that i would consider myself an expert on, this one is.<br /><br />after some years of fantasy role playing we split, me not leaving without a sense of shame of what i had become: a dork.<br /><br />you see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everybody.<br /><br />first you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack.<br /><br />then you help a little with the constitution, and while you're at it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity too? this in turn frustrates the game master who doesn't know how to deal with this invincible gang. and after a while it bores the players too, so they start to create ever more exotic race-profession combinations, no matter how ludicrous it is.<br /><br />i created a druedain warrior monk, yeah, not that far from the film.<br /><br />and that's not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game (think the hunt for experience points), but just watch the film, it shows it all - and of course the stupidity of its most basic premisses.<br /><br />for this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. i don't exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none. but once it became one, it had to be mapped into the game flow, that is: it had to be made lethal, at least indirectly. the poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so.<br /><br />sure, it's not exactly a professional production, but i haven't seen a better satire in ages.
