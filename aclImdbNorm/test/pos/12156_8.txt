"more", maybe, is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by pink floyd -in 1969 they weren't superstars yet. actually they made an album with the film music, no fan can miss it!<br /><br />but this is also the first film of german-french director barbet schroeder: it's a cult movie. when it was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. it is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slavery.<br /><br />a german boy travels to paris and meets an american girl: they fall in love. together they search for sun and exoticism. but it's a too high price love: she initiates him into drugs.<br /><br />in the sixties anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there wasn't much information. on the contrary, in many milieus taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience... so it's quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience.<br /><br />the film is simple, not vulgar at all and shot in a "cinema-verit'e" style. actors mimsy farmer and klaus gr"unberg are very convincing. "more" is a document of the end of the sixties -and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well.
