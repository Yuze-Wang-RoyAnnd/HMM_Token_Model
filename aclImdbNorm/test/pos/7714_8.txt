i've seen three of the animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of all of them. the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe. program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt kind of silly. i guess what gives this one it's special touch is the direction from shinichiro watanabe, director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) series cowboy bebop. it has some of the best elements of bebop: slick, sci-fi adventure, a no-nonsense, slightly apathetic hero working for hire, a bounty-head (more or less), and a chase scene, all wrapped up in an excellent film-noir packaging. watanabe's tarantino-style slickness comes through here full throttle.
