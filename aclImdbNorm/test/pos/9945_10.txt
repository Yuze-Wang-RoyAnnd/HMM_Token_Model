when i was growing up, voyage into space was my most favorite movie. i remember the time when ktla (channel 5) ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters watched it every single day! i still remember every part of that movie. the ending was so sad when giant robot got blown up along with guillotine and then watching johnny sokko with all the tears running down his face calling for giant robot. there should have been a sequel to the movie, in which giant robot somehow survived the explosion. :) i can't believe that there are so many other voyage into space fans still out there. i really want to buy the movie when it comes out on dvd, but my sister said that the ones out there now are bootlegged and probably bad quality copies of the movie. i don't know why they haven't released it yet, since it's been over 40 years now. i think voyage into space was made back in 1968. only now, my second favorite japanese monster movie of all time (the war of the gargantuas) is finally coming to dvd and being released on sept. 9th and i can't wait! :) now if only they would do the same with voyage into space. giant robot, johnny sokko, and voyage into space will never be forgotten! in my eyes and probably many others too, it will always be a childhood classic to me! :)
