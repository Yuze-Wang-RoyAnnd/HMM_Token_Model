this movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make "the cell" a memorable and above average movie.<br /><br />"the cell" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. the movie has some perfectly 'dreamy' sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. this movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.<br /><br />the story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like i mentioned before, the style compensates for this. the style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.<br /><br />vincent d'onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. vincent d'onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. i'm not particularly happy about the casting of jennifer lopez. i know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie. her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by vincent d'onofrio and vince vaughn. still i felt that vince vaughn was also miscast in this movie. he didn't fit the role well enough and no, i'm not saying that because i'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days. the rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.<br /><br />the musical score by howard shore was also surprising good and was sort of "se7en" like at times. it suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.<br /><br />it's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. still "the cell" is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.<br /><br />7/10
