if you want to have a great time then this is the movie to watch.<br /><br />take the premise - there is this college which admits people with minimum qualifications of ba, b.com, m.com, ma, mba, mca, b.e., m.tech and bca. so you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40+ also the school admits students of a 'heavier' dispensation and has a course of p.hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is manisha koirala. only she was a snake in the past life. still not convinced? ok read on.<br /><br />here's a scene. akshay kumar, a college student, is chased by arman and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him! then throws grenades. then one of the grenades hits akshay. but doesn't die and continues to fight, arman, the snake, plunges a half foot dagger into akshay and stomps on it but akshay is still there. then akshay gets on a jet ski and follows arman. they fight and arman chokes akshay underwater and finally akshay is dead. so we think, as soon as arman is out of the picture akshay swims away to raj babbar, principal of this college + boxing refree + parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest.<br /><br />but no one, i repeat no one takes the cake but a certain mr. nigam. you gotto watch to learn more. :-)
