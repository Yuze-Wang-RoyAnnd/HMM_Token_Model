surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features kelsey grammer (supposedly in his first lead role in a feature) as an unconventional navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own, however; he has earn it by competing against the u.s. navy in a series of war-games with a crew of untested, questionable, and lovable men (and a woman, too).<br /><br />director david s. ward ("major league") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well. second, besides the grammer character, most of the crew provide some or plenty of the movie's humor, which is treated like a double-edged sword. three members of the supporting cast - harland williams, toby huss, and rob schneider provide the funniest scenes, which includes weird gestures, impersonations, and, well, their personalities.<br /><br />"down periscope" is more than a navy version of "police academy" or "the dirty dozen". what the film does is get the job done the right way and i liked it.
