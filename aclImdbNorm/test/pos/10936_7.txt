there must have been some interesting conversations on the set of eagle's wing, with martin sheen straight off apocalypse now co-starred with the actor he replaced on coppola's film, harvey keitel. a real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last major batch of westerns in 1979-80, it was much reviled at the time for being made by a british studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic american westerns were directed by european 'emigr'es), which seems a bit of an over-reaction.<br /><br />the plot is simplicity itself, as martin sheen's inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with sam waterston's nonosyllabic kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse, the eagle's wing, across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time "before the legends began." aside from caroline langrishe's captive irish governess, the supporting cast have little to do (stephane audran never even gets to open her mouth) and it is a little slow, but anthony harvey's film does boast terrific scope photography from billy williams and a good score from marc wilkinson.
