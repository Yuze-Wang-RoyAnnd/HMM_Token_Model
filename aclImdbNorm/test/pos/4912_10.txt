warning,contains spoilers!<br /><br />this is one of the best italian sleaze films i've seen.<br /><br />the plot has a teenage girl who is interested of occultism and has supernatural powers.her mother is a member of satanist group and is afraid what influences it'll have on the girl.no need to worry, the girl knows just what to do and there's no return,she belongs to satan..<br /><br />during the film odd things happen in typical italo way,there's not too much logic,but that's only good thing.it's amazing how entertaining these films are.. on the final battle we see her and her mother fighting each other (nude off course) and doing some mysterious rituals,you might guess who wins... the films final pictures leaves your mouth open and wandering why can't there be more films like this?<br /><br />there's superb music through the whole film and the actors are quite good,better than usual in these type of films.specially anne heywood looks and acts good.it also has some unusual camera angles and stuff like that, so it's not boring at all.my rating is 10.<br /><br />hopefully someone releases this on dvd.
