the thing has to be one of the all time great movies. of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, i'd never seen anything like that! however, although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic. <br /><br />movies don't get any better than this! in the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. yet when you see them continue their chase at the us base you then think that the norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! you just know that something is not right! at this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. <br /><br />however, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of agatha christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little indians movie) sci-fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien. suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. the mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.<br /><br />after 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in "the thing" don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.
