wow, a masterpiece of a movie not to be missed. <br /><br />i had no idea what this movie was when i started watching it late night. i didn't find out it was a stone film until after the film when i went on imdb. watching it, i was mesmerized. the cast, especially eric bogosian is just superb. one of the best scripts and camera work ever...the movie drew me in and kept me entranced until the very end...i did not dare blink for fear of missing something...amazing how a small-budget film can be so engrossing and well made while huge-budget films that feature tons of action and computer generated special effects can be so incredibly boring. don't miss this film...
