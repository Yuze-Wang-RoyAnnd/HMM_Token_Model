when the long running 'happy ever after' came to an end, its characters- 'terry & june fletcher' were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel- 'terry & june', although their surnames were changed from fletcher to medford.<br /><br />terry has received a new job and as a result, he and june move to purley where they end up in all manner of scrapes- unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment, the boss inviting himself to dinner and terry trying to chance his arm at d.i.y but cocking it up each time. a fellow imdb user branded this show as 'not clever' and 'never well written'. fair enough, it wasn't clever, but that was the whole point. as for 'never well written'- some of the episodes were pretty substandard, i will admit, but overall i found it to be extremely well written, highly amusing and very well acted.<br /><br />it was warm hearted slapstick, not dissimilar to the later b.b.c sitcom 'keeping up appearances'. eight different writers contributed to the nine series, giving the show plenty of scope. terry scott was a comic genius, as he well proved in productions such as 'hugh & i', the 'carry on' films and of course, here! june whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right.<br /><br />i enjoy some modern shows- i.e 'still game', 'the catherine tate show', 'legit' and 'empty'. i even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy'- 'naked video', 'the young ones' and 'the comic strip presents' but i am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy, such as this. humour that you don't need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up. for the record, 'terry & june' was wonderful stuff. special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well!
