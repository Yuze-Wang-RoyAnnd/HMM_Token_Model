for many years, samuel goldwin tried to bring his friend jascha heifetz to the screen. one evening when goldwyn and his wife frances were having dinner with heifetz and his wife, silent screen star florence vidor, goldwyn proposed that heifetz star in a movie. after some persuasion, heifetz agreed, on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum. and the movie, originally titled "music school" was born.<br /><br />the story itself is rather stock: a streetwise boy (gene reynolds, who is best known as the producer of "m*a*s*h"), runs away from home and ends up at a financially troubled music school run by professor lawson (walter brennan). while attempting to raise funds for the school, the boy and some other kids happen across heifetz at carnegie hall. after much ado, heifetz ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /><br />the story, while predictable,is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor gaffes where different scenes were patched together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on an errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later.<br /><br />what is not surprising is how good the acting is. as was customary for studios then, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: brennan, joel mccrea, andrea leeds, porter hall, marjorie main (later of ma and pa kettle fame), arthur hohl, paul harvey, and a who's who of character actors. actress diana lynn and singer/actress kaye connor made their (uncredited) debuts in this film, as did longtime nelson eddy singing partner gale sherwood (as jacqueline nash). child veteran actors reynolds, walter tetley and terry kilburn also appear.<br /><br />goldwyn hired the peter meremblum symphony, a highly regarded youth orchestra from the los angeles area, to appear in the film. most of the kids in the orchestra weren't actors, but they were excellent musicians, as good as professionals (which many of them later became). many of the kids in the orchestra went on to noteworthy careers: kaye connor and diana lynn both starred in the theater and movies, richard berres was a producer and director, mitchell lurie founded a well-known music supply company, elliott rapaport went on to be a prominent cardiologist, lewis elias was a band leader, thomas facey a conductor with different symphonies, channing robbins a prominent instructor at the julliard school, his sister joyce robbins an instructor witn suny stonybrook, and many of the kids in the orchestra pursued musical careers with major symphony orchestras.<br /><br />while heifetz's acting was kept to a minimum, his salary wasn't. he commanded $70,000 for seven weeks. when some scenes had to be re-shot at a later date, he got an additional $50,000 for another four weeks. what thankfully wasn't kept to a minimum was his musical output. composer alfred neumann (who was once a meremblum orchestra conductor) handled the scoring. heifetz performs the "introductionne and rondo capriccioso" by camille saint-saens, his own arrangement of manuel ponce's "estrellita" (with an off-screen teddy saidenberg accompanying), dinicu's devilishly difficult "hora staccato" (from a vitaphone recording, with emanuel bay at the piano), an excerpt from tchaikovsky's "melody", an excerpt arranged for violin solo from tchaikovsky's well-known "adante cantabile" from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie), and the final movement from felix mendelssohn-barthody's e minor violin concerto. during all of these performances, there are many closeups of heifetz's performing, including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing, something that would be of value to violinists desiring to study his technique.<br /><br />the meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing the arias "caro nome" by verdi and "casta diva" by bellini, (both with sherwood singing ), an arrangement of the overture from rossini's "barber of seville", a short excerpt from mozart's "eine kleine nachtmusik", and the previously-mentioned mendelssohn concerto (with heifetz). diana lynn can be heard in the background of one scene, performing part of chopin's nocturne in b-flat minor, and a five year old mary ruth performs chopin's popular "minute" waltz.<br /><br />all in all, this is an excellent movie. amc showed this regularly up until early 1992. i haven't seen it on television in recent years, but copies of it are not difficult to obtain. if you have the chance, i highly recommend that you view the movie.
