this movie is a very enjoyable homage to the bogart and other detective films of old. robert sacchi nails it as bogie and michelle phillips is a truly timeless beauty as gena anastas. <br /><br />however, the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a hollywood film. one well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. <br /><br />the scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a lushly beautiful middle eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing. the pulsating music, the swirling veils and ringing finger cymbals, free-flowing undulations and beautiful costumes - and a surprise twist involving the seductive sybil danning - build tension and excitement until the very end. <br /><br />the three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty kamala almanzar, one of the us' leading belly dancers since the mid-1970s. she was hand-picked by famed armenian musician guy chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the road. guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene. if you watch the trailer on this site, you will see a glimpse of kamala (playing the finger cymbals behind sybil danning). <br /><br />if you're not yet a fan of belly dancing, you will be after watching this movie, and if you're an aficionado, it holds up very well after repeated viewing.
