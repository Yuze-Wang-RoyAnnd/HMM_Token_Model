i suppose this movie is not your typical spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad. the movie is based in the real story of french man jean-claude romand, and the real case is much more gory and scary than the film. in the real story of mr. romand the family didn't escape, after years of lies he decided to end it all by killing his wife, two children, parents and dog, and although he tried to kill himself, it seems he didn't try very hard as he survived. i watched the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies went undetected, i was laughing as i had read the book about mr. romand, and knew it did happen. i like jos'e coronado in this movie, he offered us a good performance, as the rest of the crew.
