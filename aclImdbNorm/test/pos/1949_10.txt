i didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies i thought i'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. <br /><br />it's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. i was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. it was a particularly great scene when feck(dennis hopper) and john(daniel roebuck) are talking to each other about why john killed jamie. it's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why. but feck had loved the girl he had killed. feck felt remorse while john felt nothing, hell he was proud of what he'd done. it really makes you think about people. keanu reeves did a great job as matt, and ione skye was good. it's weird to see her as a valedictorian in 'say anything' and her as clarissa. every actor did great at .....acting. it was real nice for a change. it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it.
