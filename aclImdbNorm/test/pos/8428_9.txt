i'm just getting the chance to dig into past austen films, and i picked this up because persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work by jane austen, and anne elliot my favorite austen heroine. so it was with great anticipation that i popped the disc into my player.<br /><br />i wasn't disappointed, either. i knew there were bound to be some draw-backs, so i'll state them, and try not to be too thick about them. anne elliot is the most introverted of austen's characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. there are passages in the book where anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. this works fine in print, but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen? short of doing thoughtful voice overs (which would grow tedious over four hours) you're left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate all by her facial expression. this can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and lacking in purpose. if you need a more overt style of austen, then certainly this film is not for you; but if subdued is more your style, and you tend to pick up on unspoken 'vibes', this will fulfill all expectations.<br /><br />anne firbank (as anne elliot), is, thankfully, an actress whose face can convey much. she looked as i had always imagined anne elliot would look: not a knockout - anne wasn't supposed to be the elegant one of the family - nor in her first youth - which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make-up. what you see is someone who is very like austen's character: someone whose appearance you might pass over once; but hear her speak, and look more closely, and she grows more attractive the better you know her. this is anne elliot, as brought to life by anne firbank.<br /><br />captain wentworth's portrayal is ably handled by bryan marshall. the bitterness is never apparently obvious (save at the concert scene); and, yes, i found it hard to believe he wound find louisa musgrove interesting as she was shown. but that is another point of austen's book: he did not find her interesting, he tried to find her interesting, and, ultimately, failed (sigh of relief). so this, too, fits with austen's original story.<br /><br />i especially liked the portrayal of lady russell, who i thought in the book was not portrayed as truly bad; this also comes out in this adaptation.<br /><br />so this is one film which closely followed the book; i could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but i'd run out of space here. charles musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters (good fun), mary the most annoying (i was dying to have her just shut up - but i had that feeling when i read the book, too), captains and the admiral i thought charming.<br /><br />the cinematography i thought a trifle stiff. there was little or practically no fade from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to it being a tv movie. one scene - chop! - the next scene, the actors enter from right, proceed left, and - chop! - another scene, where the same thing happens. this was the only part of the movie which i felt cheated me a little. a low budget has to show itself somewhere, i suppose.<br /><br />and, as i said earlier, if you like some pace to go with jane austen, don't bother with this one, as you'll find it way too slow. i enjoyed it enormously, though, as it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) to an excellent adaptation of my favorite austen novel. i highly recommend it!
