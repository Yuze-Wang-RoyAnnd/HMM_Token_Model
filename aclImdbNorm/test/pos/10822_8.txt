even if it won't give one more than previous posts here (like ruby liang's very good one) i wanted to share my own point of view. hope my english is understandable.<br /><br />bon voyage is a rhythmic, light but deep presentation of the french unorganized come-down, but also courage and charm. all along in a brilliantly reconstituted 1940 france with many details (from bordeaux luxurious hotel occupied by government hq and attacked by useless high class french, to parisian coffees near le pantheon / rue mouffetard and 1930s cars) g'erard depardieu and yvan attal give their second roles a brilliant taste;) isabelle adjani and virgnie ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles, and gr'egori derang`ere makes an bewitching performance:)<br /><br />much lighter than average (e.g. american) war times movies, and focused on the civilians, bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues (even to a french guy like me), some of them quite deep.
