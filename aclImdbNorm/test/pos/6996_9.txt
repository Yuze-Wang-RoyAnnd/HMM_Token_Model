as a sci-fi movies fan i also like alien. but pitch black is definitely better than alien 3 and alien: resurrection. it maches well into alien series. but it isn't alien, it's something else. ok, enough comparisons. this movie but me think: why people are afraid of dark. you can't run away from dark. it's impossible. you have to be faced with darkness and with that, what's in dark. in this movie i also liked that the vin diesel character richard b. riddick wasn't typical good-boy. he had a secrets and he has done bad things in the past. to the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all. first of all he want to get out of that planet himself. there is also other metaphors in this story. every big sci-fi fan should see this picture.
