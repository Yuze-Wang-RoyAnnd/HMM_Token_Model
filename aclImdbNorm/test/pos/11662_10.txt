how do you know if a movie is good or not? it is the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "dead man walking" upset me a great deal. i watched it twice. i don't know if i will be strong enough to watch it again. no, i did not feel good at all after watching it, but the film was as successful as it can be.<br /><br />robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. he avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective. i hope that many people get to see "dead man walking". i believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the movie.<br /><br />i don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore.<br /><br />the movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty. it describes reality. the reality is the best argument against the death penalty.<br /><br />a 10/10 for great performances, good filmmaking, and for the most important film made in years<br /><br />thank you, tim robbins!<br /><br />
