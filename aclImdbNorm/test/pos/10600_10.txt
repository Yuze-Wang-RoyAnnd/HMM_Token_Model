one word for it. hilarious. i haven't watched at movie like this in a long time. at points in the movie, i totally forgot it was a movie, i just felt like i was back watching viva la bam, or even watching say, my own friend going through something like this. it was realistic and i liked how bam, ryan, raab, rake, and brandon and the rest of the guys didn't try to hard too actually act. they, to me, were just acting like their famous idiot selves. there were a few scenes that i adored more than others, like raab in the shower, holy, i laughed so hard. he honestly was probably my favourite character besides bam's. he really, in my opinion, made the movie just a bit more hilarious. it's basically a must see for any fans of the cky crew:]
