this a lovely and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart. i got lost in this sweet film watching it at the mann's chinese theatre in hollywood. it's truly romantic with a touching message.the artwork and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so apparent. the frames are like watching moving art. it also has a strong and talented cast of actors. what a wonderful surprise to see joss ackland, he is just a fairy-tale perfect king. sarah douglas is terrific as the villain and christine taylor and tom schultz make a lovely romantic pair. the fact that the movie was made on a ridiculously tiny indie film budget just blows me away. it may not be the slick hollywood stuff we're inundated by but it's a really nice movie to rent and enjoy curled up on your sofa on a rainy saturday. don't forget the microwave popcorn. that's my advice. just enjoy it.
