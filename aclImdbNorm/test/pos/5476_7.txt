what i've seen of wolfgang petersen's films has been pretty good. he knows how to direct action, create suspense and get you interested. eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent. this goes for both his acting and his directing. they both hand in solid work here. the concept isn't bad, and the cat-and-mouse game works well. malkovich performs rather well, and his and eastwood's playing off each other adds to the film. i suppose this won't introduce anything new, really... but it never really claims to, nor needs to. it's two great actors, each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well, and with a magnificent director at the helm. really, it's entertaining, well-done, and it just plain delivers. editing and cinematography are good. acting and character writing is, as well. the film manages to be suspenseful and intense, and if you let yourself, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are superior films out there. the pacing is pretty much spot-on. i recommend this to any fan of the principal actors, the director and/or this type of film. 7/10
