though it's a christmas movie, "christmas in connecticut" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a martha stewart type. that's what he thinks. in reality, the lady in question, portrayed by barbara stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. she has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. they belong to the restaurant owner nearby. when her no-nonsense editor, sydney greenstreet, insists that she entertain soldier dennis morgan, she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm, and she transports herself and the restaurateur there. there's even a baby...well, actually, there's more than one. chaos ensues, and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out, especially when stanwyck falls in love with morgan.<br /><br />this is such a wonderful movie, and even if you're gravely depressed, "christmas in connecticut" can lift you right out of it. barbara stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker. despite not being as flashy as crawford or davis, she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for - she could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold, and/or sexy and she makes it look easy. on top of that, she is always attractive and alluring. dennis morgan is a handsome and charming solider; as an added bonus, he gets to use his irish tenor. fianc'e reginald gardner is all business, and you can tell he's not quite right for stanwyck. s.z. sakall as the fake uncle/real chef is hilarious, especially as he prays stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience.<br /><br />i can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of world war ii. it must have been a real beacon for the better times to come.
