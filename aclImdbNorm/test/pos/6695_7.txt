i got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 dvds. i knew nothing about the history of the series. season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4. season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being beyond good and evil with an original air date of 7 december 1998. the other 4 episodes on season 2 were broadcast from december 1997 to febrausry 1998. so beyond good and evil looks like season 3 episode 1, except there are no more episodes in season 3.<br /><br />spoilers here. the two main characters of the first 8 episodes, dr. iain mccallum (john hannah) and dr. angela moloney (zara turner), are missing from this episode being replaced by dr. dan gallagher (nathaniel parker) and dr. charley fielding (eva pope). i recognized nathaniel parker from the series the inspector lynley mysteries, which began in 2001. so they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast.<br /><br />it seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character, mccallum, when the main character is gone from the series. so they might have been planning a return of dr. iain mccallum, but when that failed the series was canceled. i have no inside information on this but i do see that both john hannah and nathaniel parker were involved in other projects in 1999. does anyone have any information on this?
