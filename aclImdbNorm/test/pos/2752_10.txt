i saw riverdance - the new show and loved it from the very first moment! it is an energetic tribute to irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! the leads, jean butler and colin dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! may they always keep shining and keep dancing. their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. they look like they were made to dance with each other! this show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. long live riverdance!
