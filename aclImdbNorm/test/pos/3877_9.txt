bring back the a-team was a hour- long special screened on channel 4 in the uk of last year and hosted by presenter and comedian justin lee collins, the show attempted to track down and reunite the fellow cast members of the a-team together, for the first time ever on tv. this has been something which has never been attempted before by anyone. well, not by anyone that i know of, that is.<br /><br />justin makes a great presenter, and his eccentric personality and humorous banter shone throughout this programme. the attempts he makes in getting hold of the cast members is ever so funny, but also he was very persistent and eager to fulfil this task too, which is a credit to him i'd say. mind you, he is great on tv anyway- be it by presenting a show such as this, or the friday night project with his co-host, alan carr.<br /><br />there were appearances and interviews with dirk benedict- the faceman himself, dwight schultz- aka howling mad murdock, marla heasley who played tawnia baker, jack ging aka general 'bull' full bright, the creator of the a-team, stephen j cannell and the big man himself, mr t aka ba baracus. they were just fascinating to watch and hear what they had to say about the programme that became a global hit during the 80s, as they reminisce and relive the good and bad moments of the show: both during and behind the scenes. unfortunately, no george peppard but of course he is already in heaven, understandably and strangely enough no melinda, who played amy.<br /><br />i just didn't understand why she wasn't featured in the show. okay, she was axed after 3 seasons or whatever, but she was the first and original female member of the a-team- only to be replaced marla's tawnia and so it would've been great to see and hear her side to the a-team story, in addition to the other cast members.<br /><br />all in all, bring back the a-team was a great documentary style of show. perhaps, this could've been spread out more by means of which this could've been a six-part documentary. but nonetheless, this was a great effort on the part of jlc. recommended
