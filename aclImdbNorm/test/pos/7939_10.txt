i saw this film with a live performance by the buffalo philharmonic, and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me; particularly, the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating. the other thing that stood out to me is the battle on the ice itself, a bit of strategy ripped off thoroughly by the makers of _king arthur_ in 2004. also, the battle goes on forever (half an hour?)-- painfully long. i can't think of another propaganda film that makes war look less glamorous or rewarding. i'm surprised stalin liked this film so well; i wouldn't want to go out and fight after watching it.
