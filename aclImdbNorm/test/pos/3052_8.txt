along with virtually every republic picture ever made, "murder in the music hall" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. a shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of radio city music hall. a murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious rockettes--among them, vera ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), helen walker, ann rutherford, julie bishop, and several other delectable b-movie starlets of the '40s. tall, blond and handsome william marshall (usually cast in musicals) hunts down the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds, against the swankiest settings you'll ever see in a film noir. the ending is as much of a surprise as is this sadly forgotten, classy murder mystery. well-worth restoring and reviving on cable-tv, vhs or dvd. republic sank a hefty budget in this grade-a production, and "murder in the music hall" is as slick, unnerving, and immensely enjoyable as any of the major studios' films of its era. possible spoiler: pay attention to the rhapsodic song composed by the victim just before his death. then, amidst the showgirls' incessant chattering in their dressing rooms, try to pinpoint the one humming that fatal melody. you'll discover who the killer is just as william marshall does. grand fun, the kind of movie they truly don't make anymore, and what a loss--both to movie-goers and actors alike.
