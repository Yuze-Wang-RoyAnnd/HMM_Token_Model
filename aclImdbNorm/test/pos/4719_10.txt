"beyond rangoon" is simply marvelous. from the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you will be amazed at how well put together this film is. patricia arquette amazingly portrays laura bowman, who we meet as a shut-down and quit despondent young doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. throughout the course of the film, as she is trapped in burma, witnesses the democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of rangoon, flees for her life, and saves her tour-guide's (u aung ko's) life, she is regaining her will to live. this may seen contrived or heavy handed: it is not. john boorman, a master at spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes, and often uses symbolism to capture laura's emotional state, and physical predicament. patricia arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded laura. what arquette does amazingly, in any role that she plays, is give us a window into her character's heart without words. every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character. she does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over the top. some critics were harsh on arquette's performance in the film when it opened on august 25, 1995, deeming that she was "flat" or "dull" in the role. i found her characterization dead-on, staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place. she is on shock and is reserved about her feelings: that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you. i am hoping that warner brothers releases this title on dvd very soon. with arquette's hugely successful nbc drama" medium" bringing her to household name status, not to mention an emmy win and now 2007 nomination, it would be in the studio's best interest to do so. hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending. do not by pass by this film. it is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.
