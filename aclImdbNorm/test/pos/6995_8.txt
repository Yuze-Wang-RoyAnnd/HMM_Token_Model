this film is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over again - the posiedan adventure in space. the characters are all stock characters - feisty heroine, judas, coward, etc. etc. the only question really is who's next to snuff it. sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but more often not - like the truly mind-numbing "red planet." <br /><br />so why does this one work? because it's stylish. the acting is above average. and above all it isn't predictable. the conclusion isn't sign-posted. i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end. that alone deserves top marks in my book.<br /><br />it's an intriguing and entertaining movie. and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it, it doesn't disappoint.
