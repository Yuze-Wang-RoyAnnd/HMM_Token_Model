now more than ever we need peace & love in this world!<br /><br />this film really showcases the wonderful music of the broadway show, and the fabulous choreography of the legendary twila tharp! i saw it again after many years, and it still holds up well.<br /><br />thank you, mgm/ua for putting this on dvd! i love the option of seeing in widescreen. mgm rocks for doing this on many of their dvd releases.<br /><br />ya gotta love treat williams as berger and john savage as claude. they couldn't have picked better actors & actresses for this film! beverly d'angelo is such a 'hot mama' in this film--i had forgotten just how hot! wow!<br /><br />the supporting cast is absolutely great,<br /><br />with the late great nell carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes, as well as the kooky charlotte ray (mrs. garrett on 'facts of life')<br /><br />the story gets a little weak toward the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 60's still holds up, and is relevant today. <br /><br />it's beautifully filmed (quite a bit on location) and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen.<br /><br />i saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when i was 15, and was moved by it then, and it still moves me now at 40. some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner--i don't think hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60's-early 70's.<br /><br />the vietnam war ended in 1975, and the whole thing hit a little too close to home, i think for this story to be filmed before it was (like in 1969, 70, 71)<br /><br />bravo to director milos foreman! i love this film!!!!!!!<br /><br />it's nice to see it again, this time on dvd. it never looked better!
