this was absolutely one of the best movies i've seen. <br /><br />excellent performances from a marvelous a-list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.<br /><br />i couldn't help but care about the characters. ms. merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead.<br /><br />i also thought that the set design was top-rate. the viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. <br /><br />the music is a blast, too. nice selections to represent mood, time and place. the blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs. <br /><br />this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. take the time to watch it!
