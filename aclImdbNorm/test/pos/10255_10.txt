cooley high is considered one of my best all time movies. it certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of cleveland and chicago during the early, mid, and late 1960's. what ever happened to brenda and pooter? some one need's to track those two down. brenda for her beauty and pooter for his innocent wit. they both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted. i think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie. i certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of movie hall of fame. all of the cast of this movie was great. my opinion is of " cooley high " is turn back the hands of time, those were the fun years.
