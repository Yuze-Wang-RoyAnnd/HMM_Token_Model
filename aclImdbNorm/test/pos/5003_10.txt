this is a great show with total freshness and innovation. that usual chair (couch for a woman) host, that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of nebuchadnezzer ....probably the pattern of johnny carson, copied by one and all, latterman, leno, conan... daly, this show does not seem to have any of these.<br /><br />i fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and i am going to stick to it. though it's too early to say that, this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project, and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. i hope that this show will last long!<br /><br />returning back after months, i still love this show, and i love his self-deprecating humor (for example, his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus, the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys) which, however, does not involve the usual monkeying of conan o'brien, for example (i know it's a cardinal sin to be repelled by o'brien's antics; but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness). <br /><br />i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it. ferensen's spoof of trading spouses (and nanny 911 in an earlier episode) are hilarious. idiot paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people's pictures, and (if i am not mistaken) they start taking his pictures shouting "gary coleman".<br /><br />added on 16th april, 2007: coming back once again, i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. either way, it was funny as hell.<br /><br />i do not expect spike feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. he is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so, i would better write down my suggestion here for him: i would like him to do a full 30 minute show with crazy gideon, the star of late night tv commercial. i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike's talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a skit in the line of snl, and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of los angeles (i know, crazy gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la).<br /><br />god willing!<br /><br />returning back on 14th july, 2007: someone wrote here that the people who praised spike's talkshow must be bribed by spike. i confess that spike really bribed me, but i must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy crowford.
