wow. when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for. this movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster in the best sense of the term. sigourney weaver was better than i've seen from her in years; emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart. i can see how this won't be every person's cup of tea, as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family. don't get me wrong -- it's really funny too -- at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again. i just think if you're open to examining your own life, imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you. i can't wait until it comes out in theaters.
