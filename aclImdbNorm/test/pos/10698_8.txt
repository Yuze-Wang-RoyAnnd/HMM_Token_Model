i've always been fascinated by ninjistsu, who would know that it will go further than beyond. in "ninja iii", it's fun creepy and intriguing. a ninja gets shot up by the police, and uses his spirit for revenge. the victim, a lovely young woman named christie(lucinda dickey). she falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting. the love scene where she pours the v8 on her body knocked me out! the ninja's death gets the attention of another in japan named yamada(sho kosugi) he comes to america not only to save christie, but to put the ninja back to the grave. simply because he put out yamada's left eye with a shuriken(throwing star). the fight scenes were excellent. i liked the part when the plywood falls on yamada, and he splits it with his foot. and when he was caught, he tells the officer christie was involved with that everything will be fine. rule of thumb: never under estimate a ninja. he took out the other cops without killing them. and he did his thing without worry. of course, chirstie did her best trying to put the ninja in his place for using her a tool for revenge. it was a good movie, great for martial arts buffs. 3 out of 5 stars!
