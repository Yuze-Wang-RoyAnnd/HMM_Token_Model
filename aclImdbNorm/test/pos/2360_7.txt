black day blue night was actually good modern noir. three young nomads on the run from their own lives team up on something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere (as most modern noir does). one woman finds that her husband is cheating on her, and after finding him in a hotel room, decides to head off and start anew. strangely enough, she travels with her husband's mistress, who is forgiveable given that the sleazebag never told her he was married. and together, while driving in the pouring rain, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. while they're giddy and free and all suspicious of one another, the cops back at town have them marked as suspects in the death of a policeman.<br /><br />black day blue night starts out with immediate confrontation, and throws in a pretty good story with all it's twists meant to mislead your suspicions of one character after another, leading to a very unusual ending. that is, the movie starts with immediate action confrontation, and once you think the story is solved, you are immediately thrust into yet another turn in the plot, revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie is over. <br /><br />but, as some viewers have written, the ending is slightly confusing and a bit of a let down. the killer is not who you would immediately expect and, once revealed, becomes somewhat confusing due to a rather thinly explained flashback which reveals all of the necessary motive to solve the mystery. but actually, there is a finale beyond that, which i would think is the most interesting of the film. because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects, almost always all of them guilty of something, it is also a genre that always involves money. and thus the question in these movies always becomes --how far are the characters willing to go for money?<br /><br />if you like this rendition of modern film noir, i would suggest watching red rock west (it's also got j.t. walsh and some going-ons in the blasted desert)!
