jingofighter i agree with some of your comments, but i have to disagree on a couple of things. first, this film is nothing like the cars that ate paris. not imho. nothing like it.<br /><br />i think the film had elements of surrealism, but i think the basic approach of the film maker is not "surrealist" per se. therefore its not really like cars paris, i think more like a weird euro work, with some scenes bearing the hallmark of "wierd" not surreal.<br /><br />secondly, i think the music by heuzenroeder is brilliant. they used whistling, that old sound from country and western records, and its waaayyy better than most aussie films which usually team the film maker up with a dumb sounding indy band that the company wants to push.<br /><br />as for the name of the film - i don't know why it's called modern love, i was kinda hoping for david bowie to appear dressed in drag and lipstick... opps i'm starting to show my age.
