george c. scott gives his finest and funniest with wonderful drama as well in this paddy chayefsky screenplay. diana rigg is attractive and quite the complicated young woman. this film veers between tragedy and chaos in a new york hospital of the late 60's with staggering consequences. barnard hughes is delightful as always (great stage actor as well).<br /><br />an 8 out of 10. best performance = george c. scott. chayesfsky was a big blow-hard when he put down vanessa redgrave at the 1978 oscar ceremony, but he's a good writer. a truly ensemble cast that works wonders, down to the smallest role. this won best script at oscars and scott was nominated. he should have won for this instead of patton the year before (which he was also brilliant in). seek this out!
