based on a true story . . .<br /><br />the premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events its possible for an outwardly 'decent' mother to get drawn into heroin addiction.<br /><br />***semi spoiler*** some of the scenes are fairly inaccurate - whilst others almost make you want to get the 'fix' yourself.<br /><br />computer technician/graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teen kid spirals into addiction after work colleague, who is a 'chipper' (-someone who can take + enjoy it now and again - ) then spirals into an addiction that leads her eventually to scoring off 'street' dealers after losing contact with her steady dealer.<br /><br />the scenes that show her coming down and getting 'sick' are often very real - especially the first real 'night sweat' prior to all these events she began a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle, and insists he has an inner radar not to get hooked on such women. some radar! however after after some late turn ups and weird behaviour, the boyfriend challenges her as to 'what is going on' his radar begins to get more with it and demands that she empty out her bag; she hits the roof and storms out.<br /><br />because of the excellent and open relationship she had developed prior to this tragedy, he is the first to 'find' some real evidence in her bag; he then looks around the hose for her 'stash' - apparently his sensibility is from school lessons on drug taking - and when he discovers a large stash in the bathroom he flushes it! not a happy woman when she takes her next bath and its 'disappeared'.<br /><br />the kid keeps one back and places it on the meal table - she then goes into further denial - admits it and says its no worse than dope.<br /><br />thge kid does all the right things and calls her friends and generally puts her in a position where she has to come 'clean' - if you'll pardon the pun.<br /><br />the movie takes the viewer through some pretty arduous situations where danger is not far away.<br /><br />eventaully she gets help from a professional organisation and does cold turkey - you'll have to watch the film to see what happens next . . . .
