hoot was terrific. the owls are adorable and the movie highlights an interesting environmental issue i didn't know existed. florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen. my kids particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. it's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. when kids are young that's when they really develop their sense of values, and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it. i think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them. it was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds. anyway, overall it was really a great time and i'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful.
