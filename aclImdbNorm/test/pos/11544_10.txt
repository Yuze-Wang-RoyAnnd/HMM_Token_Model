the numbers don't lie, 109 people have voted for this film. that says a great deal about the standing of one of the most intuitively insightful comedians of the late 20th century. and for those of you who know the work of bill hicks, if he were alive today, imagine what he would have to say about the boy president from his home state? that his short career remains unrecognized is a sad situation and this film, or rather these two films explain why. first, you see how his talent was obvious from the start, again and again, those who knew bill hicks always say he was not only funny, he was also unique. the film also shows how the quality of his material was too challenging for many in the entertainment industry. his drinking also contributed to his career problems, but that is less evident in this film. and then the second film is a complete performance. if you have never seen or heard bill hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor. especially due to the fact that the topics are now almost 14 years old, yet remain ironically up to date is underlined by the fact that many of the events took place under the first president bush.<br /><br />watching them together - first the biography and then the performance - makes you aware of how greatly talented this young man was, how quickly his life passed and how the american media can sometimes act as the great big homogenizer. let's make sure nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting and the result? well, as the man himself said, go to sleep america, your government is in control........... in his lifetime, at least in great britian this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful there. 11 years after his death, 109 people at imdb can say something about the film. after you've seen them both, i hope you understand why more people should be listening to bill hicks.
