i was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in salt lake city, utah and i still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. we felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... i can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. i loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas. i know peter finch and luv and sally had some trouble with the lip-sink but hey, this was a feel good, go feel better about things film! what i regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. i saw the cut version and i can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition. yes i wince a bit at peter's effort to make love through music but, you know i didn't see it that way when i left the theater. when they surveyed us as we left i regret any comment i made that may have altered the original. i liked it then and still see it while i listen to the music on my lp. most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and i can use the films monologues in our games of "what movie is this". i wish a director's cut on dvd was available. it is available on vhs but its not quite the same. i would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins, struggles and triumphs. picky people should leave things well enough alone. bring it back!!!!
