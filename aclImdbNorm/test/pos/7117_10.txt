my sister, dad, and i are really into d&d and one night we were browsing netflix looking for a movie to watch when this one came up. we thought we would try it out and i ended up almost dying from laughter. the writing and acting in this movie is so amazing! witty characters, great interaction, and hilarious moments kept us in stitches the entire time. i love this movie! it might not make that much sense for those who don't know about dungeons & dragons, but nevertheless, it is a good movie. this only goes to show that movies don't need an astronomical budget and big name actors/actresses to be a success. check it out if you want a good, clean comedy.
