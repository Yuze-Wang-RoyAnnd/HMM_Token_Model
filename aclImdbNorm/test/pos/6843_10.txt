the efforts of a new group of young talent bolstered by alan rickman and emma thompson, 2 extremely gifted actors, makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment. and i might add that hal holbrook shines as the senator. this movie deserves five stars. i give it a ten on your scale. and the ending is perfect. i am constantly amazed at the ability of british actors to master our american accents. i was convinced that all the actors were born in louisiana. and what finer locale for a mystery than new orleans! the big easy, also known as the crescent city, permeates every scene. as writer and director, sebastian gutierrez deserves high praise.
