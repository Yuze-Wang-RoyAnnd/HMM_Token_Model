the movie was good. really the only reason i watched it was alan rickman. which he didn't pull off the southern accent,but he did pretty well with it.know emma thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent. i like all the character in my opinion not one of them did bad,another thing i have notice. i have read all these comment and not one person has comment on alan 5 0'clock shadow. which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie. i would give the movie a 9 out of 10. another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there wasn't any sex. still it was alright. love the scene were he says "aw sh*t" when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror.
