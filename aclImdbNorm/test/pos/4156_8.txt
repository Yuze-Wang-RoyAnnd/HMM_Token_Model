some days ago, in rome, a young romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. a romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.<br /><br />therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.<br /><br />i'm only 15, but i thought: what idea of affluence does italy give to these poor people? how ever do they regard us as the land of plenty? yesterday evening i finally saw nuovomondo, and my question had an answer. when you have only a donkey and some goats, those propaganda postcards showing united states as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables, makes such an impression.<br /><br />nuovomondo is really a must-see film. it balances an ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, glances' play, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character lucy/luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures at ellis island). there's a mixed cast, going from the angelic charlotte gainsbourg to the realistic vincenzo amato, till a bitter and smashing aurora quattrocchi as the mother. but was it really so hard to enter in the new world?
