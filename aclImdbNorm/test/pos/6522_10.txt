fred was such a great show.it was simple but somehow very addicting.i can still remember the days when i'd watch this on kids wb saturdays ,but then kids wb did the unforgivable.kids wb became like that older relative that tries to act "hip" and "funky fresh".*shudder*they became like that relative who tries to act all cool ,but the attempt is a cheesy disaster.they pulled coconut fred's fruit salad inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows i've ever seen in my life(johnny test).the only thing that keeps me watching kwb anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kids.it was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule.this brings me back to my first point... bring it back!!!
