having had a great grandfather be captured and sent to changi during world war two i was hesitant to watch this when it was first screened on tv. my great grandfather kept a diary whilst he was in captivity and when he died over there his mates bought it back and i have been lucky enough to read it and feel i have at least some idea of what changi was really like, first hand.<br /><br />this is a fantastic recount of what happened to those poor blokes who were sent to changi prison and shows what hardship and cruelty they witnessed in order to protect their country. it is a terrific story of mateship, commitment and aussie spirit, that never going to give up attitude. it is worth watching if you like australian history or anything to do with world war two.<br /><br />i enjoyed this mini very much and give it 10 out of 10.
