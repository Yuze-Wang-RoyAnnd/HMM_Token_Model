this one man show may be the most fantastic show i've ever seen. to call this simply a stand up act is to do it a great injustice, there is a definate reason that this was a broadway show. john leguizamo is a master of making people of every culture feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. i would reccomend this show to anyone, as long as they can handle the language.
