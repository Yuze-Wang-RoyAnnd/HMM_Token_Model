aslan adam, or lionman as it's more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences, starts with an epic battle as king solomon & his army defeats a load of guys although i'm not sure who they were & the film itself isn't too helpful in establishing the fact. anyway, after king solomon has slaughtered all these guys princess maria, bishop osorio & commander antoine are forced to sign a treaty which lets king solomon rule just about everything in sight. soon after princess maria seduces solomon & they have sex, meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever (just two sentences long) antoine weds princess maria & is planning to rebel against solomon & gain some sweet revenge in the process. antoine & his guards attack & kill solomon even though his pregnant wife princess almunia escapes with her protector rostin with antoine's guards in hot pursuit, after the shortest labour ever (less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush) princess almunia gives birth to a young baby boy who is hidden in some bushes away from antoine's guards. unfortunately when rostin tries to retrieve the little fella he finds that the baby has been adopted by a pride of lion's as one of their own! year's later & the evil antoine now rules treating his subjects with no mercy, princess maria has given birth & he has a son but rostin is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow antoine, the task seems hopeless unless they can enlist the help of the legendary lionman who is more beast than man...<br /><br />this turkish greek co-production was directed by natuk baytan as natuch baitan & is a one of a kind type of film, i found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely entertaining. the script never seems to take itself seriously, it is a pretty funny film at times, it moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring & some of the english dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with what's happening on screen. none of it makes any sense, we get a boy raised by lion's, an evil king, betrayal, dark family secrets, birthmarks that form the shape of lion's in an element of the story that was present before the kid was raised by lion's, crazy fight scenes, torture scenes where the posts people are supposed to be tied to wobble, ancient castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires & gymnastic rings, idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair & a central character who has a jaw line resembling a house-brick, can be stabbed twice, have his hands covered in acid (this acid can eat it's way through steel trapdoors but is kept in a ceramic jug!) & fall over 20 feet onto a concrete floor & yet maintain no serious injury! aslan adam is a terrifically entertaining film, i don't think i've seen another film quite like it that i can compare it too, if your looking for something serious then forget this but if you like 'so-bad-they're-good' type films & want to have fun, laugh & be entertained then aslan adam should be at the very top of your list. total 100% gold for bad film fans & those with a taste for the different & bizarre. on the disappointing side lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end which is a shame.<br /><br />director bayten certainly keeps things moving along at a brisk pace although it's far from well made, during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand dune the next their on a grassy hill with trees in the background! there is one point where lionman uses a 'branch' to pole vault but it's obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it! then there's the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of bloodhounds are supposed the chasing lionman down but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever! there are just so many individual scenes in aslan adam that are just hilarious, stupid, bizarre or all three that i could go on forever. just check the ending out when lionman is jumping & flying about everywhere like he can fly. there's lots of blood in aslan adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence, a few stabbings & someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it gets.<br /><br />technically aslan adam is pretty ropey, the period costumes are bright & garish featuring purples, yellows, reds & various other bright colours. the fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could. the music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film & is yet another bizarre aspect to aslan adam. the acting was bad, even dubbed you could tell the acting was bad.<br /><br />aslan adam is pure gold from start to finish, there are so many things to like, laugh at & enjoy in this film that i just ended up really liking it. in no way whatsoever can aslan adam be considered a good film in any sense of the word but it's one hell of an entertaining one. i may have have to watch this one again sometime soon just to prove to myself that i didn't dream it all! the best turkish action film about a man raised by lion's you will ever see, period. proved popular enough to spawn a sequel, lionman ii: the witchqueen (1979).
