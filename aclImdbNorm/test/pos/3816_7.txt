this film held my interest enough to watch it several times. the plot has holes, but the lead performers make it work.<br /><br />catherine mary stewart (julia kerbridge), does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician. she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school. she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream.<br /><br />meanwhile, julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda (arlen aguayo-stewart) to avoid having her become a ward of the state. amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. amanda is so traumatized from her parent's murder that she has become mute. needless to say, julia's 16-hour days get longer caring for amanda.<br /><br />rob lowe plays kevin finney, a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda. he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress. amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses, perhaps more than to her aunt. julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination. kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia.<br /><br />the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great. you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film. the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well. arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words. the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other. you can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses.<br /><br />we discover that julia's sister and brother-in-law (the meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed.<br /><br />in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them. the killers search the home and fail to find their prize. they leave a living witness to their crime, amanda. the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located. eventually, the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip's location.<br /><br />eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin. he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys. the predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together.<br /><br />what struck me about the plot were major holes. kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers. how does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene, with no concern for concealing their identity. the killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention.<br /><br />the film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming. filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.
