since others have complained about putting sherlock holmes into a contemporary setting, i won't do that. basil rathbone could have fit in in any era with that voice, that savoir faire. this is a nicely put together mystery based loosely on "the dancing men," one of the best of conan-doyle's stories. instead of the original plot, it makes the men part of a nazi plot. holmes becomes a spokesman for the british war effort. his adversary is moriarity, who seems to die frequently enough to rival the central figure in the friday 13th films. he is certainly creative, but the rathbone holmes is unflappable. watson is just along for the ride in this one. he isn't given much stupidity to spout in this film and that's a real plus. the plot is complex enough to keep ones interest. there is a concluding speech that is almost a parody of itself. but then i can't be critical of a time and nation that was under great duress. if they needed to call in holmes, so be it.
