every sunday is an eleven minute short subject featuring the talents of two of its young juvenile contract players, a pair who would develop into players of note in the future. it's interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of judy garland and deanna durbin as they perform at a sunday concert for deanna's uncle.<br /><br />of course no one knew how big both of these young ladies would get to be. i've always wondered why mayer kept garland and let durbin go to universal. l.b. always had pretensions to culture and this was the guy who had jeanette macdonald at his studio and later on hired such lovely soprano voices as jane powell, ann blyth, doretta morrow, etc.<br /><br />judy certainly had her glorious career at mgm, but she paid a heavy price for it. deanna, along with abbott&costello and several gothic horror monsters preserved universal pictures. she was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick.<br /><br />so, in their salad days, deanna durbin and judy garland.
