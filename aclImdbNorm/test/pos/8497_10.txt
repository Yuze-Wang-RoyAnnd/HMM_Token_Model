first of all, it is sheer joy to hear the legend perform such wonderful and timeless music. this movie and soundtrack is a tour de force. ray charles is unique and amazing. i truly adored the film as it was inspiring and entertaining throughout. <br /><br />jamie foxx has become one of the premiere actors in hollywood as is clearly shown in ray and he should get an oscar for this role, it is unprecedented. in fact, everyone who worked on this film should receive accolades. i really liked kerry washington who played the exceptional wife...ray charles obviously married well. regina king is a fine actress as well as the extraordinary sharon warren who plays a struggling young mother.<br /><br />in all honesty, i'd say this whole project was providentially arranged. the entire cast was perfect, great screenplay and awesome settings...major props to the director taylor hackford and crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing the life of ray charles to the screen so flawlessly. this is my picture of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.
