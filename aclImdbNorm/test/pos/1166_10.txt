one of the best 'guy' movies i've ever seen has to be the wind and the lion. gad, the scenes...<br /><br />raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... a staid british gentleman calmly gets up from tea with candice bergen and drops three of them with a webley revolver in his coat. a whisper from the ghost of empire... lest we forget! lest we forget!<br /><br />u.s. marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _brooklyn_. they were carrying krags, it should have been lees, but, oh wow. and the winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless europeans... <br /><br />raisouli --sean connery, o, wow!--wondering 'what kind of gun does roosevelt use?"<br /><br />teddy roosevelt--brian keith, o, wow!--wondering "what kind of gun does raisouli use?' and writing yet another angry letter to winchester about the stock on his winchester 95.<br /><br />raisouli, armed with but a sword... a prussian cavalry officer, holstering his pistol and drawing his sword... honor. that's something long dead, from a world long gone, but raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building...<br /><br />milious at milious's magnificent best, and now out on dvd.
