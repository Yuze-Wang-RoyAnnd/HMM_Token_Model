in the wake of my personal research into the pending "end cycle" time of 2012 presented by the mayan calendar system, i believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as "what the bleep do we know?" while some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level "speak," "the elegant universe" breaks such barriers. the visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics. there are numerous messages in this movie, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what's being taught. true, pure discovery science is beautiful because there's always something additional and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of "established" science.
