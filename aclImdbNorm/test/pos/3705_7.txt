when his elderly mother emily (jeanne bates) is attacked by her lodger nestor duvalier (brion james) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, tv news reporter clay dwyer (mark thomas miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.<br /><br />although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as flesheating mothers and rabid grannies, mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!), as well as a touching study of the close bond between mother and son: clay's devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all of his other responsibilities, including his job and his relationship with pregnant girlfriend alice (mary beth mcdonough), whilst emily's love for clay ultimately drives her to self-destruction.<br /><br />technically, the film could be sharper, with more stylish direction and better effects (the shots of the creature are kept very brief, so as not to disappoint), and certain more experienced members of the cast frustrate with terribly cheesy performances (yes, brion james and stella stevens, i am referring to you); fortunately, however, the strong emotional undercurrent in the well constructed story is enough on its own to ensure that mom is an effective, compelling, and occasionally shocking tale
