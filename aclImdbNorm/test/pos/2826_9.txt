okay, where to begin. did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team shields and arnez? bet ya didn't. but they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. then they faded off into obscurity. now, this movie has everything. a crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty harry. lots of cool robots. it's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. it's the first robot romantic comedy. now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues. but there are very minor and can be overlooked. i think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it over and over again. 9 stars.
