we're living in sad times today, in which it seems like every comedy movie and tv show is painfully unfunny and inflicted with cheap, crude, or poor humor. most people don't know what it means to really laugh at a comedy, and these people desperately need to watch "throw momma from the train." i say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen, from beginning to end. the comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times throughout. don't be fooled by the murder plot. the plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about what's going to happen. the story involves a young man (danny devito) who wants to get rid of his annoying, grouchy mother (anne ramsey, nominated for an oscar in a role that was completely flawless, in my opinion) and does so by killing off billy crystal's wife, whom crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel. i don't want to spoil the jokes and gags in this film, but all i can say is that you must see this film if you want to laugh. fast-paced and genuinely, a real treat to comedy lovers, and the type of film you just do not see today.<br /><br />***1/2 out of ****
