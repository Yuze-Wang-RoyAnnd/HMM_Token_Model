i saw this movie with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was written, directed and acted in such a manner that every minute of it is a delightful watch. the people don't seem like they're acting, more like they are real people who really train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie. there are some wonderful moments where you laugh or chuckle, some jokes may be dry but are presented in a very viewable fashion. highly recommended!
