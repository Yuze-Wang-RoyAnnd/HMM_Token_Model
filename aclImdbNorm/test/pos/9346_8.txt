'thriller' remains the greatest of the pop music promos to have a plot, great visuals, and a tip-top song to wrap the film around. michael jackson was at the top of the tree at this time (and not so altered in his plastic surgery regime for it to matter). here he is in good form - the song is terrific, he leads the zombies in dance like no other.<br /><br />ola ray plays the girl who watches with incredulity as her sweet boyfriend (jackson, natch) turns into a werewolf! then to the pulsing rhythms of the opening line 'it's close to midnight', he stomps around the graveyard with the other zombies and creatures of the night.<br /><br />the crowning glory of all this is the fruity voice of the great horror star vincent price speaking in the middle of the record. terrific.
