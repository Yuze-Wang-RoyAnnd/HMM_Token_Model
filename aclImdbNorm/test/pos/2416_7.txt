this film was very different form the previous films and i had to wonder, "where is ralph macchio?" he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as myiagi's old friend who teaches julie what he already knows, then myiagi can come along and add some more! macchio could've been the love interest for julie in this film! never mind!<br /><br />on a serious level, i enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do karate, and her feelings are very different to what daniel's were. julie is much more wild than daniel was and needs taming, something which myiagi finds very challenging; she's quite a troubled girl and a rude, obnoxious brat!<br /><br />it was very satisfying to watch the transformation in julie as she warms to myiagi and gets to understand more about karate and her life in general. we can all learn a thing or two from myiagi's witticisms!
