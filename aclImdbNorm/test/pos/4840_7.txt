the most striking feature about this well acted film, is the almost surreal<br /><br />images of the era and time it was shot it. i could sense the time and moments were stark and very real. even the language was so well chosen. it's all too often when colloquialisms of today's world are carelessly used in movies about<br /><br />another time and place
