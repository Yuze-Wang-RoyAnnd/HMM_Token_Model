i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america, but this man does it for me. that mustache gets me riled up. i remember when i first saw a video of his. that girl he beat was amazing. the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt. rushmore. if i could ask him one question, it would be,"if you were a hot-dog, would you eat yourself?" will orhan be doing a reunion tour? take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot, true music from the heart never fades away. vive la john denver. gracias my friend, o.f.f.l. (orhan fan for life)
