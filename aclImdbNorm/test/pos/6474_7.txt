recently was traveling in norway from bergen, norway and stopped in the small town of voss, norway and there was a monument in honor of knute rockne who was born in voss years ago. the people all know about knute to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at his monument. this film is a great history of this great man and his great love for notre dame never realized that knute has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coached the football team. ronald reagan played the role of george gipp, (the gipper) who was an outstanding football player; reagan had a short role, but gave a great supporting role in this film. donald crisp, (father john callahan) was outstanding as a priest who always had great faith in knute during his entire life at notre dame. this is a great classic film and will be viewed by many generations to come. enjoy.
