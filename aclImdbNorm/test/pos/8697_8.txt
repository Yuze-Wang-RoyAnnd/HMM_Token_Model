absolute grabber of a movie, and given its age, years ahead of its time. i first saw this the week my dad came home with a neighbor's tv, that the guy had thrown on the scrap heap. a tinkerer with all things electrical, dad had it working inside two days. this was july 1955...and then probably only the third house in the street to have television! pretty much the first thing we ever saw on that grainy and flickering old 12-inch screen was this film. "it's pretty old dear," i recall my mom telling me!<br /><br />almost 50 years on, and it doesn't seem any older - rather like world war i in that respect! terrific little fantasy about a london omnibus carrying thirteen passengers, that crashes, killing one of their number. then, in flashback we pick up on the lives of these people and what brought them to being on this bus that very day.<br /><br />returning to the crash at the end of the film, the victim's identity is revealed, perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie the list of adrian messenger.<br /><br />if ever you come across this little gem, i suggest you watch it!
