i loved this show. such talent; and i am so disappointed that it is canceled, after only just beginning. i looked forward to this show all week long. and so sorry for the people who were hoping to be the one. i would have loved to see who would have won. it just began, and in my opinion,it should not have been canceled. i hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts, and have the opportunity to reach their goals. i voted, and sat waiting for it to come on; never knowing that it was canceled. and i could not believe that it was. i am amazed that it had low ratings; because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on tv.
