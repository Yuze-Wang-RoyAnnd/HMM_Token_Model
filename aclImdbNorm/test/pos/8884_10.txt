had it with the one who raised you since when you were young? you just want her gone from your life? that woman is your mother. you should respect her, you should honor her, whether she's in sick or well. but that in times, it can be aggravating. especially when she becomes very overbearing. that's how owen(danny devito) had to deal with in "throw momma fron the train". his momma(anne ramsey, 1929-88), is one of the worst. he trying his best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. calls him a "clumsy poop", a "larda$$", and "fat" and "stupid". for his friend, larry donner(billy crystal) he has his own woman problems, his ex-wife. she trying to discredit him. so what did owen do? push her overboard. what does he do? help return the favor, get rid of mrs. lift! in the kitchen scene, i liked it where owen called larry, "cousin patty". and momma said, "you don't have a cousin patty!" and owen shouts "you lied to me!" and el cabongs larry with the frying pan. then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift. that is thwarted, and she kicks larry off the train. well, everything back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but momma kicked the bucket on her own. maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways. a fun movie it is, and the cast is great. a classic! 5 stars!
