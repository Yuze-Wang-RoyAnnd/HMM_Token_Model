a hundred miles away from the scene of a grizzly murder in small town american, jill johnson (belle) settles in for a night of babysitting. with the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax in, she locks the door and sets the alarm. but when a series of eerie phone calls from a stranger says that she "check the children," jill panics. fear to terror when she has the calls traced. and what the police find turns the perfect babysitting job into a 16-year-old's worst nightmare. there aren't any other lead actors in this movie. camilla belle is the main star with a cute face. the day she arrives to babysit, she really has no idea what in the hell really awaits her.<br /><br />if i were in a house like the one jill was in. i would explore everything that is around. the fridge would be the first person i would looks at, but i'm a male and i don't babysit. but what i found funny was the size of the house. i was thinking, would the movie be the same if the house weren't so big? anyone could get lost in that huge house, but this movie needed a house with a massive size.<br /><br />camilla belle has a cute face, a perfect smile but it's like for a movie like this, the lead actress needs someone with experience. i found camilla not that good. i don't know maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role. i do like her, she is a cute girl but someone to have a role in this movie has to be someone how is different to take it.<br /><br />this movie wasn't scary. i also found this movie more like a "chick flick". i think the only reason this was released during the superbowl weekend was that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to go see this. it also seems like a type of a movie when girls will enjoy more than guys. but i did like this movie but for how it is. girls just like tog et scared or scream. this was just a pretty decent movie.<br /><br />maybe anyone could like this movie. there are many pg-13 horror films that never succeed. this was on its own level. so i kinda liked this movie. i give it a 7/10.
