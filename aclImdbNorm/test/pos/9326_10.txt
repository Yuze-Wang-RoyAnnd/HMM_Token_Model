michael jackson is the greatest singer and the greatest dancer that ever lived and this film proves it. it is brilliant to watch and the dance is fantastic. when michael turns into a werewolf is a bit of an on the-edge-of-your-seat part the first time you watch it. and vincent price's rap adds to the fear when all the zombies a rising from their graves. if you like this then i suggest you buy 'making michael jackson's thriller' which has the film then the making of it after it. the making shows an unbelievable performance of 'billie jean' by michael, which is when he first did on television the moonwalk. watch it.
