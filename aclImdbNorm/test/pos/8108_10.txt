i was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the united states entered world war ii. on the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as nazi germany could be misconstrued as rash. but chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. in fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. laughing at someone (adenoid hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the jewish barber) can be the best way to love them. in the jewish barber's final speech, i forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. they are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. for this reason i believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.
