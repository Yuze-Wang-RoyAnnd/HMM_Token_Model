this is such an exciting documentary, it was by far one of the most fun films i've ever seen. i highly recommend it to anyone. it's such a fun look at different musical styles, exciting people at the crossroads between modern and traditional that is istanbul, and great cinematography that captures beautiful scenes in istanbul and thrace. watching the film made me want to book a flight for istanbul right away.<br /><br />great footage of ceza, a turkish rapper. <br /><br />also his sister, ayben rapping - she is awesome.<br /><br />priceless performances by amazing turkish musicians orhan gencebay, sezen aksu, muzeyyen senar.<br /><br />the gorgeous voice of aynur, singing in kurdish.<br /><br />and amazing clarinet and signing of a romany gypsy group from thrace.<br /><br />last but not least, istanbul bands mixing turkish music and rock, as well as trance music -- baba zula, orient expressions, duman, and others...
