call it manipulative drivel if you will, but i fell for it. sure, there could have been more character development. yeah, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant "movie of the week" score, but ed harris was impeccable, cuba gooding adorable and touching, and let's face it people, in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others. not many. we did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialog in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so in my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his "comfort zone" to reach out to another human being, and in the mean time, touched the lives hundreds more. a lesson we all need to me reminded of. why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do? i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. you won't be disappointed. and bring your kleenex. 8/10
