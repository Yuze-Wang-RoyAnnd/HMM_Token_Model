who doesn't remember the muppet movie???<br /><br />kermit the frog is now an american culture icon. what child doesn't appeal to this character?<br /><br />as the first actual muppet film, the movie simply called, the muppet movie did very well. kermit takes a hollywood agent's advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad. along the way he meets up with a pig, a bear, chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets. watch for dozens of cameo appearances like madaline kahn, steve martian, richard pryor, mel brooks and several more. i grew up watching this movie and i loved it.
