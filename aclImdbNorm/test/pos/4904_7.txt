lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch garfield's gritty, breakthrough performance (introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the brandos and clifts and so on after the war) but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating. priscilla lane is a bright, engaging performer but the other sisters don't really register (though they're all allowed to be tart and witty) and i just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides garfield. jeffrey lynn is a pleasant enough actor, but he lacks the movie star weight to match up with garfield's hard luck mickey borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack. (imagine a jimmy stewart or someone in the part.) also, i was not convinced that garfield would make the pivotal (to say the least) final decision that he made. the film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action; it feels awfully rushed and under-motivated.<br /><br />still, it's not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly. it falls short of being a classic, but it does contain a few classic moments. the two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic.
