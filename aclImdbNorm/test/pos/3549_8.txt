i'm an opera buff, and operas are full of sex, blood and death. it may help to know the librettos of the operas the arias are from to really appreciate this film -- my mileage is very different than tug-3. i am a classical music lover, and i liked this film.<br /><br />i loved ken russell's "nessun dorma" segment, and would actually like to see him produce turandot, because opera is supposed to be overwhelming, truly multi-media experience , but then i loved lisztomania. i love *turandot* and knowing the libretto so well may be why i don't find this segment the travesty that tug-3 did.<br /><br />the buck henry/ rigoletto segment is probably the most approachable for the average viewer -- they are likely to recognize the tunes, and its a classic bedroom farce. i like bedroom farces, so the silliness didn't upset me.<br /><br />the "liebestod" segment is so outstanding that i recommend people watch this for that piece alone. "depuis la jour" was, for me, beautifully spiritual. and the caruso recording of "vesti la giubba" (aka i pagliacci) with john hurt as the clown was wonderful. but people just wanting naked women may feel there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex.
