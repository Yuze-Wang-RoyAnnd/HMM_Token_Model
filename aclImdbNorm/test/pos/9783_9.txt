this movie was great and i was waiting for it for a long time. when it finally came out, i was really happy and looked forward to a 10 out of 10. it was great and lived up to my potential. the performances were great on the part of the adults and most of the kids. the only bad performance was by milo himself. there was one problem that i encountered with this (and others like it) movie. all of the characters i wanted to live were getting killed. overall, i give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10. maybe we should select better people to kill next time, though, ok?
