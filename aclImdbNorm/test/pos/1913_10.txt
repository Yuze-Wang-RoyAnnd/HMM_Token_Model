dolemite is, for me, an object of my deepest affection. it's got everything: a gang of karate-fighting prostitutes, dolemite punching his fist through willie green's (director martin) stomach, high pumps and 100 gallon dalmation-print hats. moore's unique comedy raps, actually toasts, are close to the roots of hip hop. no wonder dr. dre mentioned "dolemite" 3 times on his classic album "the chronic." add the best list of characters to ever grace a movie, like the horny preacher, the hamburger pimp and, of course, "the one who no one knows until it's time." credit should be given for style to director d'urville martin, a fella who probly doesn't get as much attention as he should around film fan circles (i've been looking for a copy of his and fred williamsons' movies from the early 70s for years and can't find them).<br /><br />a lot of people are really down on this movie and say it's really bad, and it is true that you can see boom mikes appearing everywhere (look to dp nicholas josef von sternberg, for whom i think this was a very early effort), there are a lot of things going for this movie. number one, there is no other movie like it. number two, you get to see rudy ray moore do a (highly sanitized; everyone who hasn't seen moore's outrageous live act will have to use their imaginations) cinematic version of his toasts, plus him living the life of his comic book character superpimp come to life. the action scenes are pretty poor, but the characters' dialogue when they're talking trash more than makes up for it. it's full of strange little details (like the fact that the hamburger pimp is wearing a dolemite t-shirt inside out -- was this intentional or did the guy just pick up whatever shirt was lying on the set and put it on?) that keep you coming back to watch it again and again.<br /><br />at least i have.<br /><br />
