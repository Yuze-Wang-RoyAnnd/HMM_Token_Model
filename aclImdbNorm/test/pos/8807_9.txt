as i sit here, i find myself laughing at certain moments in this film. go and see this film.<br /><br />if you've ever been clubbing, go and see this film.<br /><br />if you've ever wanted to go clubbing, go and see this film.<br /><br />my bet is that the film was borne from an idea whilst out clubbing and this is the product of that one-in-a-million chance that someone remembered it in the morning and had the application to follow it through.<br /><br />in summary then, go and see this film.<br /><br />
