this is one of the oddest movies i have watched in a long while. usually if they are this strange i bail out early and rarely regret it. luckily, i held on for this one. while i can't say that this is a great movie (it isn't), i can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip - only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with "did i really just see that?" wonderment. lots of laugh out loud moments. a great cast of characters with meredith eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughter-in-law with an attitude. keep an open mind.
