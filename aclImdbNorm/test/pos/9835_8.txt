as a fan of history, mythology, and fantasy "mystic knights" show pulled me in from the get-go. it has semi-decent scripting, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has pretty good acting, and the heroes and villains all play well off each other.<br /><br />scripts--half a script is pretty great, the other half falls flat, but its all mixed together, meaning many episodes turn out so-so. also, some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines (king conchobar and angus for instance) they need to be given something... more. i'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something. acting--apart from some over acting by villagers (horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into), casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on. everyone, good and bad, works well together! costumes/weapons--the everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! mystic knight armor that falls short are deirdre's and garrett's. a chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case... and wouldn't look as plastic; his looks like bunch of snap-it-together pieces of brown plastic, when it should look bronze. ivar's trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and while garretts weapons look cool, they also look plastic.<br /><br />recently "mystic knights" has taken on too many "power rangers" traits, if you watch the show, you'll know what i mean. as the series progresses, though, it should find its niche and perfect its style. overall, it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and i watch it and we're all 20+). the plot thickens and twists, though it gets a bit juvenile in places, and everything just keeps getting more interesting. it might be of some interest to fans of the movie "willow" or the t.v. series "the adventures of sinbad". a lot of adventure, a dab of mystery, a dash of romance, a sprinkling of forces at nature... check it out! (my score: 7/10)
