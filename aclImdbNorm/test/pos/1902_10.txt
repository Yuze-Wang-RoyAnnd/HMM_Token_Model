dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. it is a pivotal film in the black exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. it wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting "whitey" with his army of hot kung-fu mama's. it was a guilty pleasure, great fun and best to watch it with friends.
