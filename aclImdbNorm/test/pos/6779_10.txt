the game was made in 1996, but it is still good today. the graphics is not that hot and the actors are not oscar-worthy but the plot is twisted, diabolic and highly enjoyable. the dark story is compelling from the first film and is continuing throughout all the play. we played several people together for several reasons: 1) to use all our minds together. 2) not to be so afraid.<br /><br />play this game and you won't regret this, just don't try to find a quake engine in there.
