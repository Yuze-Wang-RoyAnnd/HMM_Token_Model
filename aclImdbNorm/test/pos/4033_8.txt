ok, so this film may not have won any oscars, but it is not a bad film. the original "d.o.a." is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.<br /><br />the film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after "the right stuff" made him a star, and a very lovely looking meg ryan, when she was still now quite famous.<br /><br />this is more of an "update" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different. the plot is pretty much the same. a man (this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin) is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him. jane kaczmarek plays quaid's estranged wife, in a low key, but intense performance; she steals every scene she is in. daniel stern (also in an early role, before "home alone" made him famous) plays quaid's colleague. charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting role.<br /><br />the entire cast is top notch; the film is stylish, with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end. <br /><br />i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller, and as a modern version of a classic film.
