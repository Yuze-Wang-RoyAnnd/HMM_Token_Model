gilmore girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. at age 16 lorelai gilmore gave birth to rory gilmore. she left her parents house and got a job. now, lorelai and rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. they are best friends. the girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and tv shows, and are constantly quoting them. in the first season, lorelai needs money to send rory to chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents. they are happy to give them the money, but in exchange, rory has to come have dinner with them every friday night. i highly recommend this show. i love it!
