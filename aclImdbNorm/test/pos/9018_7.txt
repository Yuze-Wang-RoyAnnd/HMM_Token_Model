it's pretty good, all things considered. a must for anyone perplexed about the opposite sex (i.e. all of us!). the trailer doesn't give away any of the plot for good reason.<br /><br />the premise is absurd, so it's nice to see that it doesn't take itself seriously. it's like someone from the bbc children's department decided to make a film for adults. that's not a bad thing imo.<br /><br />7/10
