it's quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay & bi-sexual relationships, and their struggles! <br /><br />"pool days" is about the awkwardness of adolescence, and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one. a story about experience and vulnerability!<br /><br />"a friend of dorothy" portrays a common dilemma many gay and bi-sexual people experience at some point in their life: the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual. sensitively examined, this story truly left me feeling moved!<br /><br />"the disco years" shows another version of a no-win situation: getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation, but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight! a very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /><br />while these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bi-sexual or searching. each story is uplifting in its own unique way!
