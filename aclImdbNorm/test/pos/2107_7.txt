alexander lou, star of classics such as 'the super ninja' and 'mafia vs ninja' headlines here in this entertaining martial arts fest.<br /><br />the plot involves the evil abbott white (who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows) enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the shaolin temple.<br /><br />this goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members, although needless to say, one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant abbott.<br /><br />....ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like 'wu tang vs ninja' aka 'the ninja hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? of course not! - it's the fights that matter in these films and by gum - you get your moneys worth here! there's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason.<br /><br />if your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see!
