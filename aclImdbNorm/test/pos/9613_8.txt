i saw this movie on the base movie theater while in the air force so my affection for it might be influenced by the reaction of the raucous audience in attendance at the theater that night. but i do think that this movie was one of the first popular kung-fu movies and helped to begin the trend in the early 70's. it's worth seeing.
