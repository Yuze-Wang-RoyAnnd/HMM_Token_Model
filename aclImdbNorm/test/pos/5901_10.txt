everyone agrees about the technical excellence of this film by jutra (whose life ended short so tragically). as for the content, of course it makes a difference if you're a quebecker, and this explains some of the divergence of opinions. for me, it is to cinema what vignault's "mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays" is to song. in addition, jean duceppe was himself a part of legendary quebec.<br /><br />this film can be contrasted with "crazy", a current quebec release that is successful enough to be showing here in spain and is also about the 1960s. urban quebec (crazy) vs. rural quebec (antoine). but also a film that must be something very different for foreigners and for people who know quebec from the inside.
