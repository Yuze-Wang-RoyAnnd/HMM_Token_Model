there are movies that are just a different version of another one, not remakes, but just similar to others, it is not. although it talks about mafia it is watched in another way and often it seems just a secondary theme. i went to watch that movie for case (because the otherone's theatre was full) and i was satisfied at the end. it surprised me, because of its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting items to analyze. it doesn't follow the classical ways of movies, it is just different and i think not to be the only one to like that. i am very happy also because it is italian, and i was afraid that italian directors and producers were not enough brave to change themes. in this movie you can watch new italian style as well, but is not blocked into clich'es. i hope to be understandable enough, i know it is difficult, i hope also that this movie can be exported out of our frontiers, it is a good product to export. i want to point out also the music, very good soundtrack, the movie needs it because of its long silent pause and they are covered perfectly by that music. many compliments to the director, and thank you, cinema needs these movies.
