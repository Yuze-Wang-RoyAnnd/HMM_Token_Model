this film is all about humans. this film stayed as my all time favorite short cartoon for years.<br /><br />isn't it the simplest things that make life so much more interesting?! we humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, caring to each other one moment -- we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next. in our short lives, we destroy our world, each other and often, our own lives, than spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we've destroyed. sometimes, there is nothing left to fix!<br /><br />this film can entertain, educate and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives! life is short and can be even shorter! the ending is way too optimistic i am afraid.<br /><br />i love richard condie's mind and what he makes happen with it! <br /><br />enjoy<br /><br />h.k.
