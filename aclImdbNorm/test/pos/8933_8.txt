i've been wanting to see this movie for a very long time. i eventually just bought it on e-bay since it's so hard to find state-side. but the wait was...somewhat worth it.<br /><br />i can't say the movie was great. and i can't say that the movie was hilarious. but it was good and it has some pretty funny points. that aside the shots in this movie are just beautiful. and the entire cast, especially brenda blethyn (someone i hadn't seen before, sadly), were excellent.<br /><br />in the end this is a feel good romantic comedy and i recommend checking it out, unless you've just had a death in the family.<br /><br />if anything, the final chapter is highly worth the money. >.<
