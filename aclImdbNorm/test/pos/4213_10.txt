i must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the " drive in " at the circle drive in in long beach. the title was " hammer of god " from which i can never forget for some reason, but what i do remember are the different scenes that have left an imprint on my mind forever.<br /><br />my brother always reminds me of the movie although it has been forever it seems since we seen the movie. from time to time throwout the years i would look for it at the rental stores and from time to time i would check on the web and for some reason it appears like it is never available or no one knows what movie i'm talking about.<br /><br />if i only knew if and were it was available i would love to purchase that movie. if anyone is aware of its availability please inform me.
