..this movie has been done when hitler ( and mussolini who is as well in the movie) was at the top and many politics and even the roman church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of nazism. especially in usa there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in germany and europe ( charles lindenbergh for example ).it would be as today a big actor would made a parody of berlusconi or chirac. chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life, but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and imho a great demonstration he was a courageous man. the movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated. i think this movie is one of the best ever done.
