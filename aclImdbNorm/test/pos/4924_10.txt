while not the first movie i've purchased for myself, this is almost certainly the one i've watched the most. the animation is well-drawn by the experts at tokyo movie shinsa, and the animators frequently made use of clever techniques such as having the sun cause "lens flare", having the camera get soaked (and having the "camera operator's hand" clean the lens!) etc. while the film avoided becoming a an "animator's gadget-fest", the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" feel than the typical cartoon.<br /><br />the story has many interweaved plots which don't seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together at the end, in a manner even the writers self-effacingly admit is contrived. each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme, ranging from "pop goes the weasel" [hamton & plucky], to the love theme from "romeo and juliet" [fifi & johnny]. the transitions between plotlines are slightly varied, but consistent.<br /><br />truly a wonderful film; there isn't much original music, though the new lyrics to "spinning song" are clever and enjoyable. highly recommended.
