so many great talents were utilized in "the best years of out lives", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. think of what its director, william wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles, he was making a film that argued that the us's leaders were themselves profoundly anti-individual--that they had "wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war--which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under." there are beautiful sets by julia heron, gregg toland's cinematography and a script by robert e. sherwood, author of "the road to rome" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. the ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as frederic march, myrna loy, teresa wright, dana andrews, virginia mayo, cathy o'donnell and hoagy carmichael into a large-scale but thematic drama. the clever plot line was the experiences of thee "couples" after the soldiers (three being spotlighted) tried to return home to a 'victory culture". their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that "all was well with "america"". march and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he is drinking; o'donnell's young man, harold russell,, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living; and worst of all andrews' wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job, to consideration on his individual merits, to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk--for nothing, and loss of everything he had ever had. the shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again,each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting--each for his own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self, anti-reality indifferent an un-american united states. wyler's direction, especially of the scene where andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed b-17, alone and the scene of russell's wedding is wonderful indeed. this is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms, one women and men can agree on for once. music by hugo friedhofer and costumes by irene sharaff add to its luster. one of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in stunning b/w.
