shame, is a swedish film in swedish with english subtitles. the film is about a husband and wife named jan, and eva. they live on an island working as farmers. there is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island. once the war subsides a little jan, and eva are arrested as going along with the opposite side. once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. winner of the cec award for best foreign film at the cinema writers circle awards, the guldbagge award for best actress (liv ullman, who plays eva) at the guldbagge awards, the nbr award for best foreign language film and best actress at the national board of review and the nsfc award for best actress, best director (ingmar bergman) and best film at the national society of film critics awards. shame, has good direction, a good script, good performances by both max von sydow (who plays jan) and liv ullman (who plays eva), good cinematography and good production design. shame, is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive. the film has a powerful message and is a good film. the reason i'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other ingmar bergman films like wild strawberries, the seventh seal or persona, for example. the film didn't have as big an impact on me as i thought it would and it lacked ingmar bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialog. while nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about shame, and it is a good movie. i just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other bergman masterpieces.
