"the great dictator" is, arguably, one of charlie chaplin's most widely-known films. it is notorious for it's blatant satire of adolf hitler and nazism. until watching it, i only knew of it's fame. now i know how much the film deserves it.<br /><br />the film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, short-fused and impressive dictator of tomania, adenoid hynkel; and with him, his near and dear staff: field-marshall herring and herr garbitsch. also, it entails the exploits of an amnesiac, emotional and often clumsy jewish barber, a veteran of the first world war.<br /><br />stopping with the plot, i would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it both unique and wonderful. while the comedy is decidedly both verbal and slapstick and incidental, the entirety of the film shows how serious it takes nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with various interludes. chaplin's impeccable acting skills range far and wide in the film, he keeps revving it up and up until he simply explodes. paulette goddard's position as an ambitious jewish would-be revolter and henry daniell's delivery of a nasal, calm-as-death-serious-as-a-heart-attack lines makes for wonderful viewing.<br /><br />further, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it pulls no punches. it isn't "covert", it has no business being covert. it is an "overt", blatant, in-your-face, obvious lampooning of both hitler and nazism.<br /><br />to sum up briefly, watch it. just watch it, you'll see it.
