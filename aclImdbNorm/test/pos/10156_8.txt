if there's one good suspenseful film, this is one of them. james stewart puts on a dazzling performance as american dr. ben mckenna who, with his wife and son, are in africa on tour. they stumble on a murder scene, and dr. mckenna's son is kidnapped hours later.<br /><br />before you can say, "fasten your seat belts," dr. mckenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it. however, other people know he can be dangerous, (dangerous to them, that is) and try to dispose of him.<br /><br />eventually, hank, the son, is found alive and well.<br /><br />if you like suspenseful movies, this is the one to watch.<br /><br />my score: 8/10.
