when i was in 10th grade me and my buddy were up late at his house and were flipping around cable and started watching this movie. we watched it because it looked kind of funny and because it had boobs. but then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless. i think after a minute of watching the credits roll he just sort of whimpered "oh dude....." it goes from dumb 80's teen sex comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it catches you off guard. i have been trying to rent this movie for years and have not been able to find it - and nobody has ever seen it except for me and my friend - so it seems. but now it is available! i highly suggest renting it and brace yourself.
