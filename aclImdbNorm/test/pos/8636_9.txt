there is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice. in most cases this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice. however, for mulholland dr. this is different. the sequence that worked for me was: see it first time - spend a day in internet trying to figure out what this was all about - and then see it second time. otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent. then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious, camera work is stunning, and the aftertaste follows you for weeks.<br /><br />9/10
