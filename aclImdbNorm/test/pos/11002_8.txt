in "the squire of gothos", kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who keeps the captain, "bones" and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason. i could be wrong, but i think this is the first star trek episode i ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more. it is not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being who putting the enterprise's crew in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. in a way, the super-humanoid anticipates one of star trek's most famous characters, next generation's enigmatic "q". this episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character uhuara can be when the story allows her. too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.
