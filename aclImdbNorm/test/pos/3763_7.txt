i love this movie a lot. i must get this on dvd. i have 2 vhs copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. i'm forever amazed that blankfield did almost nothing afterward. he made both dr. jeckle and mr. hyde totally believable.<br /><br />the movie is plagued by it's low budget. (one atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, "siskel & ebert".) but, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate. i often find myself quoting lines (or, singing, "i've got nothing to hide") and, from time to time, completely describe a scene which matches some conversation. there are, at least, six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits.<br /><br />viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags.<br /><br />"here, take it." * visual of driving while waving butt out the window.* "i said, 'is this seat taken?'" "nice burn!" visual of chaps, headdress, jockstrap, & swim fins. * "yeah. i'm right handed." * "me! me!" says the woman trying to sell 'nads. * "bernie's going to love these." * "that's my feet, jack." says the black feet. * "why should we tell you?"... "she's at the supermarket!" * "ivy!" on supermarket pa. * loading whole shopping cart into ambulance. * etc.
