i was about 14 years old as i saw the musical version of lost horizon. i loved the film so much as well as the songs that i went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. my mother bought the lp and i learnt the songs off by heart, just as i did with "the sound of music" (which people hardly know in austria). i think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager. maybe he is an ingrid bergman fan but i was happy with liv ullman. could ingrid bergman sing and dance? what was so great about her? perhaps the critic did n't appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses since he sees a close resemblance between liv ullman and bill clinton. it was the idea and story behind the film, the philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in colour just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually appealing aspects. it's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are utterly boring in comparison.
