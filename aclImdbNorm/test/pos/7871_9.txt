i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it. eight different characters, eight different perspectives. at first i was confused by the way the story was moving along, but then i realized that it was just one scene being shown over and over again, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters.<br /><br />at first, you think the clerks are yelling at the teenager for stealing. they speak in their own language, which i (and chris the teenager, played convincingly by eleonore hendricks) cannot understand. the perspective of the clerks dispels that view. i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.<br /><br />excellent short film. hopefully, the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.<br /><br />
