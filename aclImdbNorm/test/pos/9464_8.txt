at first, i honestly thought it would be a corny movie. but after seeing this, i was quite surprised. amanda bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast (especially that character played by "bullet tooth tony" from snatch. what a contrasting role between those two movies!). now, i'm not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not, but her act, especially, was thoroughly enjoyable. even though the plot devolved into a teeny-bopper love triangle (though very funny) half-way into the movie, i feel that this shouldn't discount, what i think, the movie really is: simply entertaining. so if you happen to stumble upon it, whether by dvd or theater, i'm confident that you'll enjoy.
