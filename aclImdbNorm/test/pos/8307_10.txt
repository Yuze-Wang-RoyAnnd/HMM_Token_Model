this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child. it scared the living crap out of me. so much so that i asked my father if we could leave halfway through.<br /><br />nowadays, the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies.<br /><br />i, however, still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness. doug mcclure and peter cushing in the same movie! great! monsters made of polypropylene substitute. scary stuff. a rubber monster is, when you think about it, is even scarier than a real monster.<br /><br />the astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is. truly rousing stuff.<br /><br />there's also plenty of prehistoric tit on show, too. nice.
