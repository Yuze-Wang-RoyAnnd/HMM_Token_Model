'toy soldiers' is the story of five misfits boys (most noteably being sean astin, wil wheaton, and kieth coogan) attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the american government imprisons the leader's father. lou gosset jr. plays the headmaster of the school, a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline.<br /><br />'toy soldiers' is a funny and pretty cool action, and certainly the better of hostage-crisis-at-school movies. i think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast, but also, the terrorists don't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies, they never seem to be quite the intimidating group that they should. trapped inside the boarding school, and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes, this is a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school. they're actually pretty clever about it, too.<br /><br />i was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. it keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. astin and gosset jr. give good performances. <br /><br />i, too, agree that this is an underrated action movie.
