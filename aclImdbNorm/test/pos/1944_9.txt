i have seen this movie three times. going back to vcr's, in the 1980's, and again on the encor channel last night (feb.11, 2010). based on a true story which i remember being in the news, during the early 1980's, i've decided that i find it too disturbing to watch ever again. yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. the creepiest character is joshua john miller, who plays keeanu reeves little brother. <br /><br />(the story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the internet -- just google it. it's about anthony jacques broussard who murdered marcy conrad in milpitas, california, in 1981.) the characters portray generation x pre-grunge, borderline sociopaths, with the exception of keeanu reeves, who grows a conscience.<br /><br />old hippies did a great job raising that generation.<br /><br />for such a young kid, i thought joshua miller was excellent, as the serial killer in the making character. in actuality, he went to yale, and has written screenplays as well as directed. his acting capabilities in this film were amazing. just the way he treats his little sister by drowning her doll, and tearing up her dolls grave, gave me the shivers. it gave me nightmares. even with whats happening in our world today, in 2010, it still is the most degenerate film i've seen to date. <br /><br />the apathy, and dysfunction, of these families, is enough to make one puke. this thrill kill almost makes the manson murders pale in comparison. <br /><br />crispon glover got a little too much into character. he wound up on david lettermen to discuss his role, and almost kicked the host in the head. apparrently glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character. <br /><br />also, fight the good fight to the great dennis hopper. you're one of the best!
