the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based. it was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts, but when i located them, i could see that truth, in this case, was stranger than fiction. judith light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the mark i think of an excellent performance. rick schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court, an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent, no matter how criminal they may be. one can find fault with the movie, but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based.
