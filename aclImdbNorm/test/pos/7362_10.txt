wow! my mom bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap in some store in my town, and she knows i love scary movies. first i looked at the cover and sighed, thinking that it was some ordinary b-movie trying to be scary. i was so wrong! i made the great big mistake watching it alone, my parents and my brother was asleep and it was really late. after i seen the movie i was so scared i was shaking... i didn't even dare to go up and take the videotape out of the vcr! i slept with the lights on...<br /><br />this movies main story is about some teenagers who drives off the road and have to spend the night in the woods, telling scary stories... the first story is really scary, and it makes you hug a pillow really hard if you watch it alone.. the second story is scary too, but not in the same way as the first one. the third story (my favorite) is really, really creepy. it scared me most of all stories. it is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle. one night when there's a storm outside, he goes to the closest house and knocks on the door.. a girl opens, and she is mute.. don't wanna tell you more, but you will get chills when you watch it (i might add that my heartbeats were really abnormal when i watched it). "campfire tales"' main story has a really interesting and surprising ending. i know some guys said it sucked, but me, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and it was a long time since we got that scared.. rating: 10/10, oh by the way, it is not like urban legend at all, it is so much scarier.
