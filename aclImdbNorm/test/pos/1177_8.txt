walter matthau and jack lemmon, both of whom are sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. this film is just another example of this.<br /><br />this time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board.<br /><br />of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named gil godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys. it's hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner rue mclanahan.<br /><br />too bad that fellow dance instructors hal linden and donald o'connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that. matthau falls for dyan cannon, on board with her fellow gold-digging mother, the usual outrageous elaine stritch. unknown to them, matthau has no money either. the widower lemmon falls for gloria de haven, looking lovelier than ever.<br /><br />the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.
