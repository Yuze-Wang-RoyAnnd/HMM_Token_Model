this is by far one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time. top 20 of my lifetime. i laughed more than i have since hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, and cried more than i have since i saw the notebook. if you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. it is real and powerful. see it and you won't regret it. i was reluctant at first and i only watched it because i had to do a school project about speech disabilities. but this movie is so much more than that. it is about life, free and independent from the way the world would have you held down. its about the disabilities that each of us have that keep us from see ourselves and what we miss but letting everything else get in the way.
