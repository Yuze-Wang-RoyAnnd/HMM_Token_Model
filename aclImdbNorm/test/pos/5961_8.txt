excellent exercise on multiple plans:<br /><br />- showing the not yet ended colonialism spirit in france <br /><br />- more generally the boring mindset of superiority from all western people<br /><br />- a renewal of the spy and thriller movies: oss 117 is uncultured and stupid!<br /><br />the good idea is that, in spite of all these messages, it is a funny film, plenty of jokes and gags, very light and sparkling.<br /><br />special mention to jean dujardin and berenice bejo.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing. wonder how it will be appreciated in us?<br /><br />seems to be a success in france, so probably a next version will come.
