an off beat but very delightful performance by john travolta sets off this very funny comedy. his interpretation of the archangel is as a scuffy, womanizing, overweight, ladies man. and, he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to chicago. john hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for chicago tabloid owner, bob hoskins. angie macdowell plays role much as she did her role in "four weddings and a funeral." maureen stapleton is neat in a cameo. her comment, "michael doesn't suffer fools," is just one of many memorable moments. bob hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect, a little to off the wall. mainly you're there to see michael take on a bull, mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul. it is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.
