giant robot was the most popular japanese tv serial ever seen on indian tv. it was targeted to children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life. <br /><br />many indian children must have even seen a machine for the first time outside the school textbooks. <br /><br />the serial also showed a child in an adults organization fighting evil. no doubt, many of us who have seen giant robot in our childhood long for our own robots and as a stopgap arrangement look upon our computers in the same way. <br /><br />this show also portrayed ideal adults, (referring at jerry, johnny's buddy friend and unicorn chief azuma). we grew to respect japanese progress and still view japan as the ideal asian nation.<br /><br />btw, at that time, there were no satellite tv channels in india and the govt owned broadcaster did not show much of disney cartoons. i guess that was how child serials like giant robot got appreciated. nowadays there is pokemon etc but they are no so fascinating or alluring as giant robot.
