on june 22nd, 1941, the city of przemysl, poland is divided between german and russian. when the german invades the city, the nazis send the jews to a ghetto. the young catholic fusia podgorska (kellie martin), alone with her young sister, lodges and hides many jews in the attic of her house along two and half years until the end of the war. "hidden in silence" is another good story of human sympathy in world war ii. this film looks like "rescuers: stories of courage", and is also based on a true story. unfortunately, the actress kellie martin performs a strong and powerful lead character, but she is very weak for such a role. in many dramatic situations, the expression of her face is not convincing. i have noted that many imdb users liked her performance, but i am not sure whether they like her wonderful character or her performance indeed. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "ocultos no medo" ("hidden in fear")
