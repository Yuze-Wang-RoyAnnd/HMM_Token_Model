for me this is a good series. i am kind of disappointed that ana lucia and libby died but more upset that micheal lied to everyone about who killed them. and if any one can answer this what was that guys name who was supposedly "henry gale" he was like the leader of the others (or was that ms. clue??) anyway if you know his name cool. well trying to think of what can possibly happen next after they finally didn't press the button. does that mess up the whole darma project thing and i personally thought it was cool how they had that key thing underground that desmond used to shut off the magnet thing, yeah and what was the whole point of that? i am just glad they didn't press the button finally, but what happens to the people in the hatch? like mr. echo, john, charlie and well desmond probably died but what about the others? i think they survived, i forget? well this is just my little thing on what i thought about this season finale!!!
