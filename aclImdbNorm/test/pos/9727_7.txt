apparently a b movie ...b must stand for better acting and a better message than we get in big budget "a" pictures today. modern-day movies aimed at young women, surely aren't designed to encourage depth of character over shallow self-serving behavior... or increase the self-esteem of young girls who don't conform to "feminine" standards. (after all, criticizing the fake and flashy, like this movie does, ain't gonna help sell more products that depend on girls *not* being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty.) <br /><br />laraine day is lovable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who "bounds" into rooms and confesses to an inability to flirt. she bonds with robert cummings due to similar interests, a shared sense of humour, and her honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he gradually comes to value over the superficial "charms" of her selfish glamour-girl sister (who only brings out his own selfish, reckless playboy tendencies).<br /><br />although laraine is outwardly beautiful as well, it's refreshing to see inner beauty valued more, and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most fulfilling romantic relationship. i wish young girls (and guys) were getting this kind of down-to-earth message today.<br /><br />maybe if hollywood returns to making "b" movies again, with modest budgets, and tries to be content with modest profits... what am i saying? sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller-scale, would be like expecting a guy to give up the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. that's crazy talk.<br /><br />please, somebody invent a time machine already! i belong in 1940.<br /><br />i'd rate this movie higher, but the ending is a bit too abrupt, and perhaps lacked sufficient indication of robert cummings' change of heart. (i like the fact that b movies are short & snappy, not bloated & self-indulgent, but this one might've needed more than 70 minutes.) also found it somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so unaffected by a sudden death in their family...or be so forgiving of the one who caused it. i mean, i guess it's *nice*, but a little more grieving or bitterness would've been only natural. maybe a deliberate choice to make this family act lighthearted about their loss, to lessen the impact of the tragedy and make sure *we* forgive those involved in the death - since it's just a plot device anyway, not the real point of the film. still strange though.
