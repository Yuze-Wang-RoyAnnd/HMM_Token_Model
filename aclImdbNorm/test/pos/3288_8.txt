eager electronics whiz brian foster (a likable performance by wesley eure of tv's "land of the lost") creates a computerized watchdog called c.h.o.m.p.s. (an acronym for canine home protection system) for his boss mr. ralph norton (nicely played by conrad baain), whose home security business is floundering. a rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on c.h.o.m.p.s.; said task proves to be easier said than done. director don chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair. moreover, the game cast mug it up with infectious aplomb: the adorable valerie bertinelli as brian's sweet fianc'e casey norton, chuck mccann as klutzy crook brooks, red buttons as mccann's equally bumbling partner bracken, jim backus as evil ceo mr. gibbs, hermoine baddeley as nice old biddy ms. foster, and 60's aip exploitation feature regular larry bishop as smarmy, duplicitous suit ken sharp. best of all, the titular pooch is a cuddly delight: c.h.o.m.p.s. jumps through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer, and even does a few nifty martial arts moves. a subplot about a hulking neighborhood hound named monster supplies a few extra belly laughs (monster is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep, growly voice). the groovy animated opening credits sequence, charles f. wheeler's glossy cinematography, and hoyt curtin's funky, pulsating disco score are all solid as well. a cute little kiddie flick.
