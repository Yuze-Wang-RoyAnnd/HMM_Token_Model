the custer legend, a la warner brothers epic. there's no casting against type here, with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant custer in this rousing tribute, not only to custer, but to the men of the 7th cavalry. the story traces the life of the famed 'boy general" from his turbulent days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn. great liberties are taken with facts here, and we are presented with a custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates. but this one is done on such a grand scale, the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in hollywood. down beat ending and all, this is great fun!
