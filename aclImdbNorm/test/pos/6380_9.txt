for all intents and purposes, 'teen devian' might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical. to some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. but somewhere behind the scenes, either sadashiv brahmam (who had the 'idea' for this story) or amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.<br /><br />this is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided on whom to choose as his life's partner. dev anand's character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. dev anand's relationship with simi and kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. there are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity. the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.
