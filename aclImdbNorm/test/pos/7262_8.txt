well, i'm not about to add to the diatribe that's been 'preached' about this film.<br /><br />all i can add is that at no time does it even pretend to be a 'historic' picture. unlike 'braveheart', 'titanic' or 'the patriot' all of which have very credible and serious historical amendments, purely for theatric effect (possible the worst of excuses). <br /><br />has everyone taken a sense of humor bypass? <br /><br />all i can add is a paraphrase from the good captain macleane - 'it looked<br /><br />fantastic and we have a bloody good laugh'.<br /><br />- one last point. what astonishes me is that there are comments relating to the 'modern music' in a historic setting. i wonder if the same people made the same judgment about moulin rouge. i suggest not.
