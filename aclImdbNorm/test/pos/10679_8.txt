this lesser known film starring roy thinnes (from tv's invaders) is actually what i consider a lost gem. it was made at a time where the story was more important that the special effects (though the effect are fairly good for its time). a scientist theorizes that there is another world in earth's orbit directly behind the sun. since the sun always blocks it from us we can never see it from earth. roy thinnes is selected to go on a mission to get to this world. i don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give the rest of the movie away. let's just say there are some real surprises.<br /><br />the movie is british and has that good british flavor of acting that was in such tv series like the avengers.
