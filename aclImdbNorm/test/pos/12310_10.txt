i've been waiting years for the dead to come out on video, having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds. this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. it takes place on the feast of the epiphany (twelfth night), and is a simple, poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women. central to the story is a fairly loveless couple, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. all of the performances are stunning, and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully. of course, its source material is james joyce's short story of the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact. john huston's long career as one of hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film, which was scripted by his son, tony huston; stars his daughter, anjelica huston; and is dedicated to his wife, maricella. thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd. for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate, subtle, yet incredibly moving holiday film, this is a true gem.
