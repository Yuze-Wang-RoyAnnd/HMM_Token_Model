this is another of my favorite columbos. it sports a top-notch cast, including john cassavetes, who was never handsomer or sexier, anjanette comer, myrna loy, and blythe danner. now here's something i've always wondered - had gwenyth paltrow been born when this episode was shot, or was danner pregnant at the time? thanks to imdb, i have my answer - she was five months' pregnant. now i can really feel ancient.<br /><br />cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to danner was apparently to use the social connections of her mother (loy). he has a mistress on the side, anjanette comer, a prominent pianist, but she announces she wants more. she's sick of being back street. on the night of their concert, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. columbo picks up a few problems immediately. one thing he notices: "you have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body, and a career. where's the man?" it's wonderful to see falk and good friend cassavetes together. there's a very funny episode at the vet with columbo's bassett. everyone in the cast is great.<br /><br />this is one of the episodes that made columbo the classic series it became.
