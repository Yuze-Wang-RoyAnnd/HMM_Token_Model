i always believed that a film that's plot is centred around a virtual reality video game never sounds as though it's going to be anything special but existenz proved i couldn't have been more wrong. this film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that. from start to finish, this film has you conceptualising to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can not make a final conclusion. david cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things.<br /><br />existenz is pure cronenberg; the way it's written and the way it's directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing. cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease. his fondness for the grotesque is not as predominant in this film as it is in the fly or naked lunch but there are still some elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience wince. with regards to his earlier work, existenz is more a combination of videodrome and a less violent scanners, a pretty awesome combination. setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also enabled him to visualise more concepts, allowing for less inhibited writing. it was important that the film didn't become over confusing and cronenberg avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple. besides, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he'd know how to do it a lot better than this.<br /><br />existenz boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well. jennifer jason leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it. leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as allegra and she really gets her teeth in to the role. the emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her completely believable (if you can believe anything). jude law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. the chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of flavour. ian holm and willem dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add further depth to the film with very colourful performances. the cast of the film isn't huge but existenz definitely has the 'quality is better than quantity' ethic which works very well.<br /><br />as well as being entertaining and thought provoking, existenz touches social issues such as control and loss of self. this further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it wasn't a huge hollywood hit. existenz has so much to offer and although it isn't to everyone's taste, those who like cronenberg's work or who like science fiction will almost be certain to like this film. it is one of those films that needs to be watched with an open mind but it really is something special.
