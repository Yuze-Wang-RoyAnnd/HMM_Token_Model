hilarious film, i had a great time watching it. the star (cuneyt arkin, sometimes credited as steve arkin) is a popular actor from turkey. he has played in lots of tough-guy roles, epic-sword films, and romances. it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves. if i remember it was also dubbed in english which made things even more funnier. (kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish).
