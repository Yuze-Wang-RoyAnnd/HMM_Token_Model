this movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses. ty hackett (columbus short) was in iraq for the war serving his country and now just is being helped out making a living by his friend mike cochrone (matt dillon) making sure he does not loose his house. mike tells him that this wasn't the life his parents were expecting for him and he should be living a better life than he is now with his brother jimmy hackett (andre kinney). telling ty that him and jimmy have always been family to him and would do anything to help them out, mike tells ty about a plan to make a heist. the money would be around 43 million split six ways among the other transport men too, although ty does not like the idea he tells his friend mike as long as no one gets hurt he would be in. the last night ty was forced to talk to a welfare lady about putting up his brother in foster care giving him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life. although the plan sounds safe at first, greed isn't everything when it comes to taking lives.<br /><br />when it comes to heists, your either in or your out, so when you don't go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop greed driven people when it comes to having large sums of money. this movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested starring jean reno, laurence fishburne, amaury nolasco, fred ward, skeet ulrich, and milo ventimiglia. short i have recently only remembered him in "stomp the yard" which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college. this was probably one of his best movies i have seen him in and this one he fits the character so well it's great to see him on the big screen again in action.
