sleeper cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (i watch 24 but feel cheated with every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far. who can keep track as they are all the same. jack gets in trouble, jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then...) sleeper cell is really well done and is far superior. unfortunately they blew it with the ending in season two. i can think of a half dozen better endings off the top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and not been so contrived. shame on the writers for wrecking what had been up to that ending a really good series.
