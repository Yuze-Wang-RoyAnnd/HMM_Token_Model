after a very disappointing part 3, i kinda wondered if i should even bother with the next karate kid, while i could see why this saga wouldn't continue, i still enjoyed the next karate kid most out of the second and the third karate kid movies. while there are some very unrealistic moments and situations, it was very enjoyable and the story is a catchy and warm one.<br /><br />hilary swank, has this girl come far or what? she plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when miaugi sort of "babysits" her per say, he notices that she has karate skills. he offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first karate kid, but i would recommend this one. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />7/10
