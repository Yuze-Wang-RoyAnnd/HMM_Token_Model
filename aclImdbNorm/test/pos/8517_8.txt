if you can watch a bond film from 1983 that isn't as good as octopussy and still enjoy it.<br /><br />if you can accept production values which aren't that much above the level of a tv movie.<br /><br />if you can look at sean connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious toup'ee and still see james bond.<br /><br />if you can get past an inexperienced basinger, a weaker largo and a jolly q.<br /><br />if you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, not up there with barry on his worst day.<br /><br />if you don't believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release.<br /><br />if you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same.<br /><br />yours is never say never again and everything that's in it.<br /><br />and, what is more, you'll probably enjoy it, my son!
