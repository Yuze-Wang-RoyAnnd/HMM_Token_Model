the soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts. you must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes. you must know the story through various other reviews, so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie.<br /><br />firstly, the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities. the first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. the second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance. you hate the former and your heart bleeds for the latter.<br /><br />the second thing about this movie is the entire concept of loving one for who one is, irrespective of gender. so, would you still love your partner if he/she were to change his/her sex? the movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful one.<br /><br />but there is one point where the movie fails. i wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way. that what they feel is love doesn't come across till the end. but watch it, and post your thoughts on it here.......
