like a great many twilight zone episodes, one of my favorite parts of this one was the overt social commentary that serling is making with the story. as was the case with a recent episode "the howling man," i was reminded of my long standing suspicion that, for example, if jesus were to come to earth to bring his followers to heaven, he would be immediately judged insane and probably thrown into an asylum. our main character in this episode meets a similar problem when trying to convince the 1860s americans that he is from the future and the president lincoln is about to be assassinated. the episode wrongly asserts that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others can't, but it's a fun time travelling romp nonetheless.<br /><br />granted, we don't know for a fact whether history could be changed by time travel, because time travel has never been accomplished and, sadly, never will be. but it seems logical to me that, if you could physically place yourself in a time of the past, you could physically prevent something from happening, as long as you didn't flail around like a lunatic yelling about assassinations.<br /><br />one of the consistently interesting things about time travel films and tv shows, in my opinion, is the method by which the time travel takes place. there is really no method at all here, our main character is having a conversation about time travel at a posh gentlemen's club and then walks outside and into a dissolve from the early 1960s to the mid 1860s, but no matter. the twilight zone has thus far not struck me for its complex sets or high production values.<br /><br />russell johnson plays the part of peter corrigan, the time traveller, and upon discovering that he has been somehow transported back to the exact day of lincoln's assassination, he manages to get himself thrown in prison, but luckily for him john wilkes booth, for some reason, just happened to be hanging out at the police station and overheard the frantic corrigan desperately trying to describe the very assassination that booth was planning for that night.<br /><br />booth requests custody of corrigan for some psychiatric experimentation, and the police officer sees nothing wrong with relinquishing custody to this guy. he had a business card, after all, how bad could he be?<br /><br />the show seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly altering events in the past through time travel, and while i'm not willing to accept that time travel would include such limitations, it's still a fun episode that really makes you think, which is one of my favorite qualities of the good twilight zone shows...
