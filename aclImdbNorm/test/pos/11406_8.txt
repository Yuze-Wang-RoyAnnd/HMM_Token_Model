people say that this film is a 'typical teen horror movie'... well it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it.. what do you expect! it's a good film, i counted 3 actual screams in the audience whilst the film was on and it was a very jumpy scary film. i wasn't bored in the film at any point and i was even on the edge of my seat at one point. the only thing that was slightly bad was that it was a tiny bit slow in getting into the actual storyline but this all led up to why she was where she was and why what happened, happened. the acting was good, the scenery was good and the storyline was good too, i hope to see a 'when a stranger calls 2' in a few months! good film!
