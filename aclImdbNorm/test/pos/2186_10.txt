i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck, i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation. as it was, i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs. for my birthday, my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd role. <br /><br />i've shared the play with many...some finding the subject a bit sick, but none having anything but praise for the songs.<br /><br />i've always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as well as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpin.<br /><br />i must own the dvd.
