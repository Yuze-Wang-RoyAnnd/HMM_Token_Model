well, let me put it this way - i have always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; i've always loved rock music, and especially heavy metal!! that's why this movie is like a gift from god! i believe this movie is one of the best movies ever (well, except from neverending story and star wars, of course ...). it's great to hear all the classics, like "long live rock and roll" (dio), "stranglehold (ted nugent), songs by jon bon jovie, deep purple, ac/dc, zakk wylde and several other legendary rock bands. heavenly! absolutely gorgeous! wonderful!!! i hope they will make more movies like this (otherwise it's just crap movies, like that "ac in da usa" or what they call it, and "8 miles". bulls***!). well, i strongly recommend this anyway! everything i'm missing is a couple of stratovarius-songs! but except from that, it's one of the best movies ever! ten out of ten!
