2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like bully, elephant and kids (although, by my point of view, 2:37 is a superior film to those three ones).before watching this movie, my expectations were neutral, but i ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay, murali k. thalluri's perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors.<br /><br />the sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies, tv programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness, discontent...and specially madness.some people may say that 2:37 arrives too late to that artistic movement; however, i do not think like that, because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar stories.<br /><br />on the characters from 2:37, we can find clich'es from the juvenile cinema (from director and screenwriter john hughes -rip-'s movies to the teen horror films): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "nerd", the antipathetic athletes, etc.it would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay; but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which, in more or less degree, any person can find on his/her road to maturity.<br /><br />2:37 is an excellent movie, whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected, but which compensates that with a lot of positive elements.it will be very interesting to see thalluri's next projects, since he has had a great debut with this movie.
