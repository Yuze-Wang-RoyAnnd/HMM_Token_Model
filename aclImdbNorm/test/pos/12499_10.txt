i was plagued by nightmares involving sesame street and the muppet show during my childhood. i loved the programs, but when i slept, i'd dream about muppets not unlike the ones on tv...but not quite the ones on tv.<br /><br />they would speak gibberish and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other. they'd take a bite of their cute felt flesh and it would tear apart followed by arterial bleeding. nice! but that was the past...i love this show! i saw peter jackson's meet the feebles years ago and wondered why there wasn;t similar work out there. well here it is, as sick, twisted and somehow socially potent the old hobbit's vision.<br /><br />if you like this show, and you haven't seen meet the feebles, get it on amazon or some such film source. you're in for a treat.<br /><br />by the way, clarence would totally kick triumph's dog ass.
