i must have seen this movie about four or five times already, and it gets better with each viewing. suffice it to say: this is the best film i've ever seen. and i think i've seen a lot.<br /><br />but i've always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings. for example, take the imdb top 250. why does it rank only at #216 (as of today)? surely, the answer's not in the film itself (because that is nothing but flawless), but in its reception. the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its anti-death penalty attitude. and so, obviously, the more conservative-minded user probably didn't like the film (as you can see from some of the other comments). so dead man walking gets a ranking that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say, and maybe they didn't want to understand, being pro death penalty. so now i get it: it's all political. you're pro death penalty- you don't like (and therefore don't want to hear) what the film has to say.<br /><br />i'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs.<br /><br />mr. robbins, your movie's issue split people's opinions. some reconsidered their point-of-view, some simply didn't listen, but you made a very important point. your movie will probably never show up on any "top 100 movies of all time"-list, but it'll be remembered, long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 (all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the oscars 1996) are forgotten. congratulations, mr. robbins, and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking.
