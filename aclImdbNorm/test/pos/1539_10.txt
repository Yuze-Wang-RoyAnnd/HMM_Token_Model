this film hits the heart with a reality like no other i have seen. it shows what us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. the acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. mr. rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. the set is incredible. it gives the feeling of 'in the round" theater. which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action. this movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer, and i'd say they have made a success of that goal.
