oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and so gut-wrenching. <br /><br />makes everything seem so superficial, so pale, so meaningless in comparison. <br /><br />sister helen is not a real saint. <br /><br />she is a real human - flawed, raw and blunt, but passionate and with a heart of gold.<br /><br />what i found most interesting is that this handful of wretched, miserable people found meaning and laughter.<br /><br />what i loved most is how the documentary portrayed the polarity of human nature.
