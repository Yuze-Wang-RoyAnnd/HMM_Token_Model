howard (kevin kline) teaches english at the high school in a small indiana city. he is finally getting married to emily (joan cusack), much to his parents delight. the town is abuzz, too, because one of its own, cameron (matt dillon) has been nominated for an acting oscar. everyone, including howard and emily, is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is declared the winner! in his acceptance speech, cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man, in part, because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. you guessed it, its howard! but, howard has never "come out"; in fact, he believes he is straight! with the whole town, and members of the media, waiting and observing the happenings, will howard and emily go ahead and get married? or, is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony? this is a wonderful, funny, and humane film about a gay man and his situation. as the man-who-did-not-realize-he-was-gay, kline is excellent and touching. the rest of the cast is equally fine, with cusack a stitch as the mixed-up fianc'e and dillon, bob newhart, debbie reynolds, tom selleck, and others on hand to delight the audience as well. the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland is beautiful. then, too, the script, the direction, and the production are very, very nice. but, the insightful, humorous, and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film's best asset, no doubt. for those who would be offended by a gay-themed film, yes, just skip over this one. but, for everyone who wants to laugh heartily, and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best film out there.
