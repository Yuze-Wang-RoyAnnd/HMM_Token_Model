there is not much of a plot to this movie. there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience. not much more than that, but .... it does not matter!<br /><br />it does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life, and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not cracking up laughing, you have a smile on your face. <br /><br />matthau plays charley, whose wife recently passed away, and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital. he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him. then he meets anne atkinson (glenda jackson) who, at first, is a patient in the hospital (their first scene together is very funny) and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show, where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed. <br /><br />charley begins to like anne, and vice-versa, except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to give it a shot - two weeks of faithfulness. <br /><br />i will not give away anything else, but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen. she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic, middle-aged comedy, but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable. she is matched every step of the way by matthau, who is more charming than ever. he does not have to play mr. sensitive or mr. macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /><br />art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor. the scene where the baseball team owner's ashes are buried at home plate is priceless. he also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin. richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau; the role does not tax his considerable talents, but he had to have had a good time making this comedy. <br /><br />very much recommended...8/10<br /><br />ps. fyi -- matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar, and jackson presented best actor to art carney for his role in 'harry & tonto'..
