i have never before seen a movie quite like this, nor as funny. i laughed my goddamned ass off and have watched it repetitively. infact i am watching it now. chad from cky is hot too. anyway if you never liked it, blow it out your ass, you have no taste. the movie involves ry (ryan dunn) having just broke up with his girlfriend turning to valo (bam margera) and falcone (brandon dicamillo) for help in finding out exactly what she done with "hellboy" (rake yohn), and with the help of raab (chris raab/raab himself) they do just that.<br /><br />the fender bender scene and the scene with cactus at record bin were hilarious.
