dad (78) and i (46) both had a good time watching the flick today. for a guy primarily known for serious roles, de niro is a heckuva comic actor. of course, it helps to have his past film images to play against. consider that one of those roles, 15 minutes, was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media, and you have an interesting set of compare/contrast performances.<br /><br />murphy plays another of his axel foley sort of characters. shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self who was best known for tj hooker and not star trek.<br /><br />it's interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film. shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood; de niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish. ironically, as the film progresses, de niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of tv-cop reality into the real world case he's working.<br /><br />the film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources, so one could make the comment it is derivative. well, so what? satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist. and besides, the film does have quirky moments of originality. for example, i'm reasonably sure the method of the villain's death has never been done before. <br /><br />one quibble about the reality of the weapons involved-- shouldn't those guns have had some kind of recoil? in order to penetrate steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate. and any bullet's highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing. so.... firing a volley of these tank-killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts. oh, what the heck... it's a satire. maybe the guns' lack of recoil is itself a satire on the b-f-guns used so casually in thrillers. <br /><br />
