red dust is both well acted and well made but what the movie is about i think will bore many viewers as it did to me. there was a film that was out earlier called "in my country" with sam jackson and it was not that well received and both films were about nearly the same exact thing, i do think red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by future oscar winner chiwton ejofor but the plot is just to lacking, it starts off pretty strong but then the film hits the viewers with countless un-interesting court room sessions, this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lacking. but see if for the performances.
