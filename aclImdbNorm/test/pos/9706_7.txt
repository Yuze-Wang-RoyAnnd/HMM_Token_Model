just got out of an advance screening, and wow was this movie hilarious. possibly better than the first one, but at least its equal. if you don't like jackass, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity(way more than in the first) then stay far, far away. but if you dig the whole jackass thing, then this movie will not disappoint. toro totter is the greatest invention ever. ok. so my review wasn't long enough... all else i have to say is poor, poor dunn, they really kick the crap out of him in this. so if you enjoy masochistic humor, and prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever (john waters is involved, need i say more?) then this movie will keep you in stitches for it entirety. i never stopped laughing, and actually came out drenched in sweat.
