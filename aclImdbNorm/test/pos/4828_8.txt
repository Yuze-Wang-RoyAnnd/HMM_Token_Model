this work is pretty atmospheric, with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements. i found this work more rewarding than i first expected, given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb. the dialog comes across as natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to clich'e with the heroines falling down when they should be running, and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors. typical horror movie fare.<br /><br />the local characters are some of the worst clich'es, depicting appalachian natives as in-bred developmentally challenged freaks. the characters of the children and the principals are great! the development given is adequate, and scout taylor-compton seems to be developing her talents quite well.<br /><br />now, i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread (which isn't all that great by the way), but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back. i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means, but there are some really good horror elements herein. but there are also some really slow spots where plot/character development seem superfluous to the director's (or the film editor's) whim.<br /><br />all in all, this is good for a rainy night, but not so good for a friday/saturday night's viewing.<br /><br />it rates a 7.6/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
