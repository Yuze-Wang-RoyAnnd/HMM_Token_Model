well.....i wouldn't want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i consider important about this beautiful film. i saw it for the first time in 1976 (i was 14) and then one more time a year later. that was it. the rest of it was the pink lp of elton john's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. how deep? a week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present. (no dvd's yet). boy....was i surprised!! poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty, love, god, idealist pursuits, stay with you forever. since they occur mostly at the heart's level (no intellect yet!), they define your soul's contours like a sculptor would do with a stone. if sometimes we didn't tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute, of every decision, of every turning point of our lives. <br /><br />so, i confess i feel nostalgia. but the fascinating part of this is watching the film again, and through this trip back in time, enriching that understanding of why we, people from the 60's, grew up as we did. the spirit of those times is all here: a genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success, make love not war, the beautiful pop ballads, the poetry of the lyrics, a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love, these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into "adults". <br /><br />i showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as na"ive and foolish. guys, be serious!! cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments. and this is exactly what "friends" does in a masterly way. it reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were 15. i'm now a musician and i feel some of us, artists for that matter, still dream about it!! how else could we live? that's "friends", that's "brother sun sister moon", that's "hair". those were the times, still alien to aids, alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody, to pornography presented as "sexuality", to this barbaric new "world order" growing after september 11th. <br /><br />what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. what a trip back to the very core of our hearts: to paris, to elton john at his best, to that urban scenario surrounded by 2 cv citro"ens and the vw beetles. what a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in camargue, surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. they made us who we are, as did serrat in spain, brel in france, peter paul and mary, joan baez, luther king, the beatles, the early bee gees, belafonte's spirituals, gandhi, the gospel of elvis. <br /><br />people still hoping: get this picture. start with innocence and grow from there. you'll find out what it's all about. and from there you'll have a solid and more truthful foundation; some ideals to look for in life, a way to handle personal and world affairs. we need so much of this today! give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end.
