i was hugely impressed with this movie, if for nothing else than for the comedy. it might not be the edgiest, wittiest humor at all times, but i found it appropriate to every scene.<br /><br />the flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled, almost confusing sometimes, but that is how the characters feel. sometimes, we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships. this might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers, but it brought me closer to the characters' dilemmas of irregular chaos.<br /><br />the acting is great from everyone. i'm a huge andy richter fan, but i wasn't head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be. he did very well, but julianne nicholson and lauren graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. jay mohr performs as expected, if you've seen him in other films. i've always liked him.<br /><br />overall, the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships. when it comes to relationship questions and problems, some films try to surprise. there's nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here, but it's entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film.
