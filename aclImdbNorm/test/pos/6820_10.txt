the youth in us is a pitch-perfect gem. i saw this stunning short at this year's 2005 sundance festival. the story took me on a profoundly transforming journey. the directing by joshua leonard, the acting of kelli garner and lukas haas, the art direction, the cinematography, the score -- every element was true to the bone. one can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is prelude to more great work from this gifted director.<br /><br />just as a short film is shown before a feature at sundance, commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past. it would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like the youth in us could reach a wider audience this way.
