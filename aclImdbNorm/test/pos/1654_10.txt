the ultimate gritty heist film. elements of bogie, welles & sinatra will leave you sweating & satisfied. in comparison, it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films, such as "oceans eleven (remake)", reviewed in such high regard-especially in europe. films like rififi must be shown, spoke about, and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics what true classic noir is.<br /><br />criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer.
