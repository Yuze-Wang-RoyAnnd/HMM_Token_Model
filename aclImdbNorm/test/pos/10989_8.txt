i found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting. initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me. later i found myself lost in the power of the film. how do you repay a gift from god? the ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from god warmed my heart. the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. i left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. what more can any film do? hollywood, i hope your paying attention. america does like positive, upbeat films.
