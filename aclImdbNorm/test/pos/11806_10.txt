although flawed in it's view of homosexuals, this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning aids. despite the depressing subject matter, this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys, and will make you laugh as well as cry. very well-acted by all, especially joseph mazzello and brad renfro. the language is a little strong, though appropriate, and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. but remember to have the kleenex ready!
