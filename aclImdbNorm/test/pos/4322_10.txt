this episode so far is the best of the series. the story was told perfectly. i especially liked how the writers made it a desmond episode; it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the emmy for his performance.<br /><br />we had some of our questions answered in this episode, but since the show is called lost we know there will be more questions brought up too. first the answered: walt is reunited finally with his father michael, second, michael's betrayal is exposed to jack, sawyer, kate, and hurly and because of this betrayal kate, jack, and sawyer are all taken captive by the others. this was a great way to end the show.<br /><br />on the other side of the island we see locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. this leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. however there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to locke, eko, and desmond when desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies. guess we'll find out next season, however great ending to the best show on tv.
