"here on earth" is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about samantha who has both boy problems and health problems. as her love for her current boyfriend, jasper, fades away, her love for kelley blooms like a new spring flower. <br /><br />i found this movie very touching, very warm, very romantic, and touching. i enjoyed every bit of this movie...and that's pretty rare! i highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers! this is one film you don't want to miss!!! :d<br /><br />by the way...if you're a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies, bring tissues!!! on the other hand, it was a really really good movie!!! very romantic...and surprisingly good!!! :d<br /><br />
