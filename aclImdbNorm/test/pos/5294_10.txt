i had heard news about this film from anime-legend hayao miyazaki, and i so wanted to see it. but i was lucky enough to the film online at youtube; after watching the film, i knew that it is another miyazaki/studio ghibli classic.<br /><br />this film, inspired by my favorite fairy-tale "the little mermaid," is about a 5-year-old boy named sosuke, and his relationship with a goldfish princess, whom he named ponyo, who longs to become human and be with sosuke. i won't give you anymore details, you'll have to see the film for yourself. so overall one of the best animated movies ever made, with plenty of fantasy, adventure, and humor...i loved it!
