first real movie in this year. amazing long shots, sometimes with fix camera, so specific for nordic cinema (let aside dogma). a true auteur film i find it. athmospherique :-) it simply delighted all my senses and keep in mind how the image goes violent and painful during the scenes when he's trying to kill himself. that's the point i don't think it stands up in the whole plot. why, if this was an ideal world, couldn't you die but still you were keeping your conscience ? either was the real world with "tailored" rules or was a "fantastic" world but in this case no accidents like people remembering how it was before can happen.<br /><br />it reminded me of kafka and maybe more, of huxley's brave new world, especially in that part where sex was actually available to everyone, since it was viewed like a right to pleasure. it lacked a plot but i think it was better like this, since you realized and sensed the whole strange behavior of everyone, the absurdity and the lack of real sensations in this "happy" world.<br /><br />i think also that the end was brilliant. true world is indeed a homo homini lupus, you're eaten if you are not strong enough.
