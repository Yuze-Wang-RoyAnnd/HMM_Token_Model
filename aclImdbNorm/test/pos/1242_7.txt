perhaps i was just in a really good mood when i watched this film. but, for whatever reason, i really liked this film. was it terribly original? no. was it a bit predictable? yes. and so what? it was still a really nice movie. i've always liked bruce willis (well, almost always, there was hudson hawk and the fifth element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. maybe this movie isn't academy award material, but it sure is feel good material. go rent it.
