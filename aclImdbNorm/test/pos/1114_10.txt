talking about competition features at the split film festival, we have titles from all over the world. china, korea, canada, usa and australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. modern love...thats for sure. <br /><br />in that movie by alex frayne, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. the coastal village seems like something in an american horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants. but episodes in alex frayne's pastorella can't be described as horror in the normal way. in fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more. in this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric australian film-making. thus is the the case of frayne. always something new and fresh. visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some australian directors is astonishing good. frayne's movie is super. there is something in the australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in frayne's modern love and in ray lawrence movies lantana and jindabyne.<br /><br />it seems it will be the same in future titles of alex frayne.
