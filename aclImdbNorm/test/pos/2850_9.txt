i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through. it has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending i shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.<br /><br />if theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was morgan freeman and chris rock's interaction. these two are great and it warms my heart to see rock isn't going to do crappy big hollywood fare like lethal weapon 4 for the rest of his life. freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore. hell, kiss the girls was watchable with him in it.<br /><br />renee zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and kinnear is good as her obession.<br /><br />sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male. 9 outa 10<br /><br />
