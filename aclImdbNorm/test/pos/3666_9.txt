the film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. i am the first one to agree that victor fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. i also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. so what? if it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? does every film have to make sense? does every film have to be perfect? no. a person could get razed admitting that they love this film. again, so what? it's got lovable characters, it's well shot, the acting is mostly good, it never becomes too maudlin or dramatic, it's quirky. look at how many people love i dream of jeannie. is it perfect? heck no! and while this is very different, i say check it out and you'll be in a good mood after you see it.
