when i was a kid, i loved "tiny toons". i especially loved "tiny toons: how i spent my summer vacation". i thought it was laughs on the floor funny. a few years later, my friend had the video. and i figured i'd watch it for the good old days. i was still on the floors laughing. my opinion, the plucky and hampton skit is the best. they decide to go to "happy world land". and they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. all the skits are funny. i'm still looking for the video. so, if anyone has any tips. please write me. <br /><br />this is one of the funniest cartoons i have ever seen.<br /><br />10/10
