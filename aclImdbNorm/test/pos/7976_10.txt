if you like shoot em up westerns this is a keeper. i thought that the movie was fun to watch and to see folks that i have not seen in a while. i am no expert but i liked the acting. the town and props etc seemed to fit the period and kind of town that you would find out on the frontier. this is not an a western, not enough people and budget. the costumes and firearms were correct for the time! i expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future. rachel, chance, rebekah and kirby were great. the sass (single action shooting society)members that contributed to this effort were pretty darn good. hope to see more.
