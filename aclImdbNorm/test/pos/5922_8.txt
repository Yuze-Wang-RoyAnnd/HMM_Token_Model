billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh, the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927. jimmy stewart plays lindbergh, and while he might be a bit too old for the part, he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down-to-earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star. wilder directs solidly, balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge. it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work, but it is a gem of a movie. it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american. overall, it is just plain good.
