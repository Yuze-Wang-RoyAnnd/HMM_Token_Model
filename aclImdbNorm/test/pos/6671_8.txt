*may be spoilers* no doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre i've ever seen. is prot an alien or just a crazy bugger? this is the question you'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie. <br /><br />kevin spacey is simply amazing, as is jeff bridges. you can't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times. some of kevin spaceys actions in this movie are very funny. when he was up in the tree, for example, and when he was talking to the "queen" mental patient, the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared.<br /><br />to simply put it, right from the start you'll be hooked, and if you really love drama's you won't be dissapointed.<br /><br />a solid 85%.
