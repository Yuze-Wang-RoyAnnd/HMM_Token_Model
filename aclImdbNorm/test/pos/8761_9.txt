"traffik 1989" is an emmy award winning six part miniseries out of the uk which was the inspiration for the oscar winning "traffic 2000". the five hour film breaks down the opium/heroine trade for the viewer from the handcasting of poppy seeds in an afghanistan field to the "head rush" of a mainlining junkie in a flat in england. not only does "traffik" offer entertainment value through interleaved dramatic stories it also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels answering the who, where, how, and why questions of the age old and unstoppable narcotic supply/demand machine. synergistically entertaining and educational, "traffik" will prove to be time well spent for teens and up.
