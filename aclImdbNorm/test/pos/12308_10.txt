the argentinian music poet, atahualpa yupanqui, once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world. they look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music...<br /><br />this film, as i feel it, is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country's history. first, a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it. then some, believe that they hear it, but they don't. then, nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it. and others recognize that they have heard it, but didn't think that others might be hearing it. finally, everybody listen to the same music, and suddenly it doesn't sound any more...<br /><br />love and poetry, as a real nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children...<br /><br />why would he call the film, the dead when nobody dies? the spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it dubliners, following james joyce's title...<br /><br />a nice 1900 irish filmed postcard!
