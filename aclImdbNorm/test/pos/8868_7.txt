this was very funny, even if it fell apart a little at the end. does not go overboard with homage after to hitchcock - owen (danny devito) was lucky he had "strangers on a train" playing at the local cinema, so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration. <br /><br />devito is very funny but also a little sad. he has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing. his teacher, billy crystal, is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success, which also has him frustrated a great deal.<br /><br />best parts are the book proposal by mr. pinsky ("one hundred girls i'd like to pork") and all scenes with anne ramsey, who is so horrible that even mother theresa would have wanted to kill her, too!
