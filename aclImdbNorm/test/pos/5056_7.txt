very typical almod'ovar of the time and, in its own way, no less funny than many of his later works. and why is that? there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and i guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional. no, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into the scenery: the characters' nearly complete lack of taboo. it's the same kind of 'comic suspense' you find in his later works, though you'll find it in a more rough version here. he's building up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there.<br /><br />the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did, claimed that it had to be a "very select" group of people who'd find this movie hilarious. i do.
