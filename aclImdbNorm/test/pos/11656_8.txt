this movie is a story of a catholic nun as an advisor of convicted killer on death row. the movie describes what she does as a nun, who does not have any productive role. she might have had doubt in her actual role. but eventually she does the role only a nun could do, who has nothing but faith in christ. in america, there are so many movies that describe condemned criminals or jails. those scenes, especially execution, are too much different from japan.
