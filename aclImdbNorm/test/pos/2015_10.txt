this is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'the wedding singer'. whilst the 'wedding singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'rock star' is all about metal.<br /><br />mark wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and jennifer aniston plays his girlfriend. when his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.<br /><br />the story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of rock'n roll! the music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! the whole concert feeling is very well captured, since they used real audiences (no cgi here).<br /><br />great direction and a brilliant performance by marky mark, who acts like a true metal dude!<br /><br />'rock star' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you are going to love this movie!<br /><br />10/10
