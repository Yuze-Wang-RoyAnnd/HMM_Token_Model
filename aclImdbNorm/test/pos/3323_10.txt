i first saw this film in 1959 at the hoyts double bay cinema in sydney when fifteen years old. i loved it then and still do. the ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted "naturally" and you "felt" for them in the respective roles. a "glossy" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. the soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that film score monthly released the cd in january, 2005. pity scenes were cut prior to release - even at two hours you want more! i have registered with amazon for the dvd (they do now have a special page). to view this film in cinemascope after forty six years of pan and scan will be great. twentieth century fox, please look further into your catalogers of fifties cinemascope productions for dvd - there is a large market out there. i await arrival from us of march, 2004 vanity fair special article on the film, which is said to be fifteen pages with many photos on set. cheers.
