who'd a thought suicide could be dealt with in a way that's palpable by everyone? i saw the film at sxsw at it's premier and it turned out to be the best film there by far. yes, its warped and it's bizarre, but it makes sense in the world the filmmaker (michael parness) creates. if you didn't laugh (most everyone did), then you just ain't getting it and thats a darn shame. particularly of note, guillermo diaz as hector steals a bunch of scenes and the chemistry between natasha lyonne and david krumholtz is intense. the film reminds one of harold and maude, but not really, it takes one bizarre spin after another, and they do all make sense in this crazy mixed up world we all live in. i stayed (as did most) for the q & a afterward and what was great was hearing that the same things i thought in my head as to why things "happened" are the reasons they did. i don't think you can say much bad about the film, unless you didn't get it. i think i got it and it seemed like most everyone else did as well. the film is dubbed a suicidal comedy, but its got a lot of heart, a lot of laughs and offers a lot of hope, yet it doesn't shy away from the horrors of suicide as well. a nice little movie that should get attention when it gets a release, which will hopefully happen sooner rather than later.
