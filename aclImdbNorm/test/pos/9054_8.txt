hick trek is clearly a film that is envious of even an el mariachi-level budget ($7,000). still, the creators are able to pull off decent effects at times (often due to great editing) such as the beamings, the situations aboard the cat ship, and slim t. jerk's unique way of communicating with his ship without use of a traditional communication device.<br /><br />the acting does have its rough spots but the portrayal of "horns" mcboy is excellent and fluffy is certainly not too hard on the eyes.<br /><br />i do wish that the film had been longer than its approximate hour - and that should be seen as a compliment. this movie is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved.
