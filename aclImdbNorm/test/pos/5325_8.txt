there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they're not careful. you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended "why" the movie presents at the end. nothing it solid, it's not definite, it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it. i think that was the plan from the get-go, people aren't meant to all understand it in the same way, it's almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little better.<br /><br />the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is. it's dramatic and thought provoking, a lot of heavy ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost soothing, even with its more intense scenes with yelling. i think it's probably leland, he's just calm and almost serene, even for all of his sadness. the movie personifies leland in a way.<br /><br />of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it, but there are some recycled ideas. i mean, leland has a lot of impressive dialogue, he is anything but typical, but he's not a prophet. everything he says is not a revelation, many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned, even i have observed a few things he's observed. leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan gosling's portrayal.<br /><br />in the end the acting is all exceptional, there are no real bad guys, there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland, only to maybe understand him and life a little better.<br /><br />comparable to igby goes down i think, not comedic, but similar in its general outlook on life.
