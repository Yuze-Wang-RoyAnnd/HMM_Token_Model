a warmly sentimental tale from the author of the waltons. were someone to pitch the material to me, i would probably reject it as too maudlin. but the dramatization here manages a tear without the expected embarrassment. no one in the 1950's was better at lovable hayseeds than arthur hunnicutt. his appeal here is put to consummate use as a mountain man doggedly faithful to a loyal hunting hound. their fates are tied together as inseparably as any human bond. good. i see a subtle environmental message here. all critters go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil that merely follows instinct in order to stay alive. there is no deceit in the kingdom of animals, and yet how cruelly we often treat them. an oddly satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
