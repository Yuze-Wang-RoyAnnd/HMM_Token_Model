as roger corman has said in an interview, low-budget film-making enables film-makers to take chances on offbeat ideas. well, you'd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as george barry's "death bed: the bed that eats".<br /><br />the film does have a back story to it, and it's an interesting one at that. i'll forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it. suffice it to say, the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger, consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid.<br /><br />"death bed" is an eerie, haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare. it occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously. it's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick. it dabbles in exploitative ingredients - there's some tasty dollops of female nudity - and yet is also art, albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility.<br /><br />the special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget, and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine, although patrick spence-thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist / narrator, and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand: future 'boy meets world' father william russ!<br /><br />this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds; this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film - even if the exposure took years to take hold.<br /><br />if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items, "death bed" may be just what you've got in mind.<br /><br />7/10
