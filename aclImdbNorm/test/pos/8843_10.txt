this is one of the most outstanding horror movies i've ever seen in my life time. forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there.john carpenter as made a tour-de-force horror epic with outstanding special-effects great performances from kurt russell and co and a great soundtrack that will haunt you for ever! the greatest thing about this movie after 17 years is it has'nt dated it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this.back in 1982 this was up against e.t. and of course it failded and was a box-office bomb. over the years the thing as made a cult following from video and t.v sales and as many new fans. in the end this movie kicks ass and to me it as never loss it's edge to scare the pants off of you and to me that a horror movie. long live john carpenter!!
