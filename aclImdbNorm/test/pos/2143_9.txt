i first saw this film when released in 1980. from other sources, i've learnt that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in new york city, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. so, i guess i saw the shorter version first which, at the time, i thought, was a very interesting anti-western, if a trifle confusing...<br /><br />so, it was with even more interest that i finally obtained a dvd of the full-length version. i'm glad i did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic, and the critical vitriol poured on michael cimino was unwarranted, to say the very least.<br /><br />yes, it's a long movie, but so have been many others. for example: once upon a time in america (1984) at 227 minutes; cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; the ten commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; spartacus {restored version} (1960) at 198 minutes; gone with the wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. so, it can't be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back, when heaven's gate came on the scene.<br /><br />but note this: all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes.<br /><br />not so heaven's gate: in this narrative, the american west is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness, injustice, and poverty. and that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film: it laid out the circumstances of the johnson county war of 1892 in wyoming, showing how the wyoming stock growers association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of european immigrants accused of cattle rustling; and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities, right up to the president of the united states. for an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link at wikipedia under johnson county war.<br /><br />very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history, and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. had it been a documentary, it would have been barely palatable for most; as entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous.<br /><br />leaving aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment, that cimino launched herein, what about the narrative
