this story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. as a boy, i enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. books like "call of the wild", "white fang", "the frontiersman" and "my side of the mountain", influenced me tremendously. i wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when i saw this movie on television in 1975. i wanted to be just like "trapper". however, as i got older i found i was just too domesticated to live like that. nonetheless, i still romanticize about living that kind of life. i agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in "disneyisque" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then i think you find yourself pleasantly touched. i make it a point to watch this movie once a year. after thirty-one years, i still get a chill running through me when i see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing, haunting laugh of the trapper.<br /><br />-good luck old-timer and stay free-<br /><br />ps if you want to read more about the true story, i found this link on the mad trapper of rat river:<br /><br />http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/nwt/madtrapper.htm
