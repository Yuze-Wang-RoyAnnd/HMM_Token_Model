aaron carter plays the pop star(j.d. mcqueen) in this movie (surprise surprise). this is a typical movie where the leading lady (jane) has a huge crush on j.d. mcqueen the pop star (as well as many other girls) but she's the lucky one that gets to spend the days with j.d. and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy. j.d. has to go to a public school to keep his math grade up in order to do his summer tour. problem is j.d. isn't good at math. he finds the smartest person in school (jane) to tutor him. jane tutors and falls in love with j.d. j.d. in return falls in love with as well but j.d. screws up and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour. the movie is definitely worth watching. aaron will be a great actor!!!
