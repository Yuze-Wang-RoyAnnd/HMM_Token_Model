where to begin, i like the scary snow-monster named jack frost. the whole concept works well for me, we thought he'd be back and he was. changing the local to a tropical resort works. seeing old friends and meeting new characters. scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost, you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. yup, jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first. i do have one complaint, the little jacks or the jacklings as i call them. they looked like hand puppets. i think they could have done a better job with the jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. if you liked jack frost, then you will like this sequel. no questions or debate, 9 big stars.
