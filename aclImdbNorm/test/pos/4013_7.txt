oh i remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my homework.<br /><br />still, the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.<br /><br />but the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.<br /><br />the lead actress (can't remember her name and i'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance. she made the show watchable.<br /><br />they just don't make shows like this one anymore...
