ok, so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers, but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted, right? right! consider yourselves officially warned, and read on...<br /><br />in this parody/tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980's - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious murder mcgee, who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard. as i'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "where's the beef??" and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get. good times...<br /><br />no clique or 80's horror movie clich'ed characterizations are left unrepresented here. in fact, no stone was left unturned at all
