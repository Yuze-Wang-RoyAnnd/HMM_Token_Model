when i know that walter will never grace another set.i was in my 30's when i first saw this sweet,endearing and unabashedly romantic film.i loved it from the first scene,and all the way through to the end.art carney was his usual daft self; glenda matched walter step for step in the witticisms;and richard benjamin supplied the sarcastic voice of reason that he does so well.along the way there were many actors whom we all recognize,doing their usual brilliance. there are a couple of lines in the movie which my so and i have used throughout the years,but i won't say anything about them here.i'm pretty sure you will know which two i am talking about. just get this movie.make some popcorn,grab your squeeze(if he is as sappy as mine is,for which i am thankful),and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70's. you will not be disappointed. however,i have the feeling that i am preaching to the choir here because anyone who loves walter will already own it.i'm very glad it's out on dvd now,finally.
