featuring some amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, superbly designed and executed sets, nightbreed is a great film.<br /><br />sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity.<br /><br />perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries.<br /><br />none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie/superhero genre.<br /><br />a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting. <br /><br />another idea would be the foundation of the new midian. perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus.
