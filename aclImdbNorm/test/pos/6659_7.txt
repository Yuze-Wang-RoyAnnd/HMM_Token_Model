this movie worked for me because i see this movie as an exact opposite of 'gone with the wind.' farm owners instead of plantation owners. scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until ruby, (renee zellweger,) shows up to save the day. sort of, in a round about way. deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. even the love story was opposite. if this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. <br /><br />there are only two things i didn't like about the movie, the rest i thought was well done and i liked it enough to recommend it to friends. first, i couldn't see the attraction between inman, (jude law), and ada, (nicole kidman,) as being strong enough for inman to desert to get back to her. inman said he only had written to her a few times where ada wrote to him almost constantly. second, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. i must say it was full of action because of that, but after about the second scene i knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. i like to be surprised by the next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does.<br /><br />i thought all the acting was very well done, with zellweger the best. she deserved the credit she got for it. i thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. she must have done her homework on the part. zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. i think that was true. law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to kidman. it must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than i thought it was. now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact i chose her performance after the other two. except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion, i don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. she still did a good job, i just thought the other two were better. <br /><br />i liked the scene with the zellweger, kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes i mentioned above. i thought the 'home guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. i thought the scenery was beautiful. the movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.
