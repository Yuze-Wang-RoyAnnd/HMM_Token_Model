big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. but as i was watching it, i thought about something. some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable. so really, the film is kind of a big fat lie. there is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this. here are all of the unbelievable stuff.<br /><br />1. when he fakes his father had choked on a meatball, and acts like he is the father. jason(frankie munez) couldn't have gotten away with that. well, luckily for us, he didn't. so it didn't stick with it, the outrageous.<br /><br />2.even if the grandmother was blind, she still could've figured out that that wasn't her granddaughter. <br /><br />3.they couldn't have gotten on the plane, flown to l.a., acted like they were coat salesmen, sneak into the studio, and then, and then... well, some of the film is a little unbelievable. but it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie. trust me, i do it all the time.<br /><br />big fat liar, though unbelievable at times, is fun. it's also very funny. but let me just say one thing before i continue this review. if paul giamatti wasn't in this movie, it would really suck. it would be horrible. big fat liar is also pretty funny, though corny at times. i give it a thumbs up.<br /><br />big fat liar:***/****
