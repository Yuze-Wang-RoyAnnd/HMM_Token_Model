surface was awesome, i don't know how many mondays i survived at school just by thinking about the new episode of surface. i loved it, sometimes i had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me. i was pretty upset when i heard it was cancelled, i mean jeez way to let us hang. so,they can have their new tina fay comedy(you couldn't pay me to watch that, i think seeing the commercials made me dumber). i'm gonna miss my monday night fix of surface, even if my sister did make fun of me. although,kidnapped does look good and, they still have l&o: svu (i think, i still have to check) (i only wrote the 2 lines above, because they said i needed ten lines).
