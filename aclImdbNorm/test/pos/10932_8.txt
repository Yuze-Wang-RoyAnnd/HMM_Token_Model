"eagle's wing" is a pleasant surprise of a movie, & keeps the viewer interested. i didn't know anything about it being made by the british until i read the other viewer comments. i can understand why it won an award for cinematography, for it was brilliantly presented & must have looked magnificent on a vast theatre screen.<br /><br />it seemed to be a lot more realistic than most westerns, in portraying how the west was more truly won. as well as the complexities of the characters it presents. the indian-sam waterson character is particularly intriguing. he seems to be brutal in the savage environment he is conditioned to, but displays remarkable respect for the frailties he witnesses in the white men & women he encounters. he is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his lands, but he has a limit to his sense of vengeance, even a compassion when he is in a position of power & observing the wilting white man bent on revenge, as well as the girl he kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach. as such, his character seems complex but congruous to the harsh lands he lived in & which were threatened by these intruders he is not heartless in his dealings with.<br /><br />the magnificent horse he rides is a critical link & it is interesting to note how this indian handles it, compared with the martin sheen-character who has it in his possession & power for a time. "eagle's wing" is an unusual western, a genre i am not drawn to, but i really appreciated this excellent offering, which i would rate second only to "a man called horse".
