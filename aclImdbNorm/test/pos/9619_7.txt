having recently seen grindhouse, i was browsing in video usa looking for some movies that might have played in real grindhouse theatres in downtown areas during the '70s. the hong kong action flick five fingers of death seemed just such a picture. the cartoon-like sound effects and the quick jump cuts seemed a little distracting at first but after a while i was so involved in the story and the characters i didn't care. parts of the music score sounded like the "ironside" tv theme song that was subsequently used in quentin tarantino's kill bill movies. some scenes involving the hero's fianc'e seemed to border on parody but they were so brief that they didn't ruin the film. the most exciting parts involve the tournament and some revenge segments after that. well worth seeing for kung fu fans!
