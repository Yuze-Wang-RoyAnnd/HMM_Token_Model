i absolutely love this film. everything about it. it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen. the way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. i related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some. i'm really glad i ran across this movie. if only there were more genius' like justin out there!
