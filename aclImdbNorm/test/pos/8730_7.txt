far more sprightly, and less stage and set bound than gene saks' previous efforts barefoot in the park(67) and the odd couple (68), cactus flower is not a work of art, but compared to most of the tired farces from the 60's like the apartment, how to murder your wife, goodbye charlie, a guide for the marrried man, divorce, american style, any wednesday, kiss me stupid, boys night out, it's a masterpiece. director saks and writer i.a.l. diamond have effectively "opened up" abe burrows' broadway hit, and the film benefits greatly from new york city location shooting and excellent performances from ingrid bergman and goldie hawn. bergman is charming, looks great, and demonstrates a flair for comedy. hawn in her oscar winning role has never been better or more appealing. matthau is ok though it's hard to believe that hawn's character would be so enamored of him. and in retrospect, hawn's attempted suicide at the start of the film is out of character and unbelievable. nonetheless, the film has a plausible farcical set up, and once it gets going it generates laugh. rick lenz, jack weston, eve bruce, and vito scotti provide good support. the film is likable and fun, and hawn and bergman make you care.
