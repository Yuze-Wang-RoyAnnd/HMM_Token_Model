this is one of my all time favourite movies, if ur not into cars then forget it!! this movie features 1 of aussies greatest muscle cars, the xygtho. yeah so the acting not the greatest - it was never made to win an oscar. the car action will keep you comin back for more and more. there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an awesome '57 chev - with a real cool cat drivin it! also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor. the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly, but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie. big fast cars with pleantly of steel(no plastic cars), and some cool street dragging. i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting.
