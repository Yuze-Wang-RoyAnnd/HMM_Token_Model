in the 2nd of his historical martial arts films, chiba portrays his real life sensei mas oyama. the film even recreates oyama's incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands (oyama did this feat over 50 times in real life). dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic kyokushinkai techniques. ironically this is one of the rare sonny chiba films in which he doesn't tear out or rip off body parts of opponents. a must see for sonny chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films
