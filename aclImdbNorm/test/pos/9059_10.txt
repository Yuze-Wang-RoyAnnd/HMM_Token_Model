on a scale of 1-10 "suicidal sweetheart" got an 11 from me and from everyone else at this showing. the picture was incredibly funny. i told my wife "it's obvious that this man walks on water but across a bed of fire, that's a bit much." this is one of the very best blends of comedy, satire and uses of innuendo i have seen since mel brooks' "young frankenstein". i can't believe this picture was not picked up by a major studio.<br /><br />this "film festival" audience was sophisticated and was able to pick up on every comic innuendo either visual, spoken or implied. the characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great casting was obvious. max and grace are real people with real problems that are dealt with regardless of the odds of success. it keeps you smiling while being serious and laughing with all the indirect humor brilliantly built into this production.<br /><br />to sum it up, this is a "must see" picture.
