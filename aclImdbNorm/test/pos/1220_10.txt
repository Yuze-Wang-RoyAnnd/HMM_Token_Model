cute movie feel good movie i had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent. i had high hopes for this movie based purely on flex being in this movie. i have never seen him in anything not worth while. true to form this movie delivered for me. i enjoyed the story. the movie is full of great actors and actresses. the hilarious tasha smith, essence atkins and of course tangi miller. i really liked this movie a lot. i didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that i thought the movie should have detailed. the issue was apparently resolved but i would have appreciated a discussion resolving the issues. i liked the movie so much that i am now buying the movie after i've already rented and watched it.
