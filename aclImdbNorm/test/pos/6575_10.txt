i was one of the lucky people to be invited to view this film in new york. it is a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the tragedy of september 11th. this film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit, through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days. the film makers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved. it was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people. i walked out of the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello. i would recommend everyone see this documentary. i would rate this movie with an a++++++++++. see it if you get a chance.
