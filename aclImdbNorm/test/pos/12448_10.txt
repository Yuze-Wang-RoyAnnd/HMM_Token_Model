slipknot is a hardcore rock band from des moines, iowa. nine band members who all wear customized boilersuits, and personalized, homemade masks (eg. #6's clown mask, #0's various gasmasks, #8's tattered + torn crashtest dummie mask with dreadlocks). the music itself seems to walk the finelines between sane and otherwise, yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic.<br /><br />"welcome to our neighborhood" sounds rather a generic title, but the footage itself is something else. interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest, selftitled album, 2 live performances, and one banned-by-mtv music video (a brilliant homage to the classic kubrick film "the shining"), the movie clocks in at not even half-an-hour, but is certainly worth it. it is perfect for introducing any metal/hardcore fan to slipknot.
