"goodbye, mr. chips" is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film. aside from peter o'toole's wonderfully controlled, understated performance as the pedantic schoolmaster who finds love and is changed by it, the film contains hundreds of stunning visuals, from grecian ruins to london side streets to an extended countryside montage. the music and lyrics by leslie bricusse have been criticized as being dull or not-up-to par for film musicals, but they are used to enhance the story rather than tell it. many songs are used to underscore montages or scenes; the few that don't are relegated to "show biz" numbers. in this manner, the songs do not intrude upon this delicate story but heighten what the characters are thinking or feeling. "where did my childhood go?", "walk through the world with me", and "you and i" are especially effective. an absorbing, brilliantly acted, directed and written film.
