while driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved betty-ann, adam (eric jungmann) is surprised by his former schoolmate harley (justin urich) on the backseat of his car. adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron harley because of betty-ann. along their road trip, harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road. after some incidents, they give a lift to the hitchhiker sarah (aimee brooks) and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck.<br /><br />in spite of having one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a horror movie, the irritating harley, "monster man" is a surprisingly good trash horror-comedy. the story is a collection of clich'es, beginning like "joy ride" or "duel"; then it turns to one of the countless rip-offs of "the texas chainsaw massacre"; there is a surprising twist, ending with a hook for a sequel. there are hilarious scenes, aimee brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "monster man"
