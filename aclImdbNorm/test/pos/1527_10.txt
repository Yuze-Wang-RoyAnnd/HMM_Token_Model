this is an amazing movie and is very clever at using the few actors and sets. it is also very shocking - the physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implied) is mixed with calm and even humourous stretches. so the horror is always unexpected, and brutal. i'm not soft, but this would have to be the most shocking film i have ever seen. the message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer. this is the film i will always remember both actors for.
