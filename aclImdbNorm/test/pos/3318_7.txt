the best of everything is a high gloss large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women, hope lange, suzy parker, diane baker, and martha hyer at a new york publishing firm. what's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all.<br /><br />presiding over this group of young fillies is wise old mare joan crawford who's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life. she looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point.<br /><br />around the time she was making the best of everything joan crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, alfred steele died. it was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her. she inherited all of his stock in pepsi cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as the best of everything was being made, she wound up the queen bee at pepsi cola. life does sometimes imitate art. so that authority as she barks out dictation and coffee orders to hope lange rings real true.<br /><br />in fact all the women here with the exception of lange are in for some rough sledding. it's rough for lange too, but she literally makes the best of everything.<br /><br />what a collection of stinkers the men are in this film. the best of them, stephen boyd, is a heavy drinker. the others louis jourdan, robert evans, and brett halsey, are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film.<br /><br />i can't forget brian aherne either who's the fanny pinching head of this publishing firm. half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today.<br /><br />some nice location shots of new york in the fifties make the film a real treat. catch it by all means.
