isabel has just gone out of jail. she is decided to not return again, but life is difficult for ex-convict, specially if they are homeless, as isabel. when she finds the one that was her boyfriend rufo, she can see a light of hope, but rufo is now not only a junkie but also an aids ill. this will not make isabel surrender, because, if there's a will there's a way and she is going to fight for her future, to have normal life, with a house and a family. a very hard and touching film that has passed unaware by most of the spanish cinemas, actors are great and the story is very touching, maybe a better treatment of the secondary characters would have made the movie better, but it is really good. i highly recommend it to watch it, but be aware that this is not a disney happy film, it is hard and dramatic.
