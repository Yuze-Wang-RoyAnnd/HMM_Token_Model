this is the essence of the early eighties! the malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack... i am in love with this movie. this sweet, intelligent romeo & juliet teen flick is instantly addictive.<br /><br />martha coolidge is one of my favorite directors. she really employs her actors, like john hughes and steven soderberg, so check out -joy of sex- and -real genius-. the soundtracks for -valley girl- are great. if you can find a copy of the film, buy it! it's out of print and very hard to come by.
