this movie makes you think. it shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. i think that women might think about this behavior, but i don't think they act on it. the dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. i was relieved when the prisoners escaped. i was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not. maybe that is more realistic. life seems to run in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed running up hill.
