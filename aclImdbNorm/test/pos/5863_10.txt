this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever. it has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... if you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further. the story of a man, bent on revenge. and how better to get it? "i know, i'll suck out their brains!" with great sound effects, and impressive special effects, i can't recommend this movie enough.
