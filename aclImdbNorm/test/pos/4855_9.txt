i just saw it at the toronto international film festival. director neal slavin's impressive starring cast includes william macy (seen in the contender at last year's tiff), meat loaf (aka meat loaf aday, aka michael lee aday), david paymer, and laura dern (also starring in novocaine, also at this year's festival).<br /><br />based on the arthur miller novel by the same name, focus follows christian but "jewish-looking" lawrence newman (macy) as he struggles among the hatred and anti-semitism in his neighbourhood. pitted between the jewish store-owner down the street (paymer) and his card-carrying anti-semite next door neighbour (meat loaf) newman faces difficulty in dealing with inner conflict and conflict around him. guilt over knowing what's right but not doing anything battles with wanting to blend in and keep peace with the neighbours. things gets more complex when he meets and marries gertrude (dern) who everyone thinks is jewish. gertrude teaches her husband a few things about judging books by covers.<br /><br />will newman stick up for the jewish man in the end or will he flee? go see it to find out.<br /><br />the acting was fabulous. the writing was incredible. the cinematography was excellent. the sound was well done. technically amazing, the movie was disturbing. chilling. emotionally intense. i found myself bringing my knees up into the fetal position a couple of times. i have great admiration for everyone who worked on it. i have not seen a film this good in a long time. it touched me.<br /><br />wow.
