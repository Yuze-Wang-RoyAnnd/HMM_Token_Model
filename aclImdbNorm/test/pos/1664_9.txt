i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressive.<br /><br />in its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film. this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller. relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on, giving us two movies for the price of one.<br /><br />john servais plays the idea man tony le st'ephanois (always referred to as "le st'ephanois") with such world-weariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel. tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re-entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where, as punishment, he physically whips her with a belt. thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. after that sobering event, since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship, tony meets with two of his old partners in crime, jo and mario, and decides to join them in one last big heist. they enlist the services of cesar, an italian safe cracker - played by director dassin himself - and we are off to the heist.<br /><br />the heist goes off without a hitch. but cesar's womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. however, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for, since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film.<br /><br />it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family; in fact jo's son refers to him as uncle. i think it is partly to help jo's family that tony agrees to the heist. the ending scenes, where tony saves the life of jo's kidnapped son, partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions. but only partially.
