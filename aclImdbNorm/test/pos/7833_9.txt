the tagline on the box hails, "100 trapped passengers... 3,000 venomous vipers!" you almost have to admire that degree of "no chance in hell we're ever going to deliver on this promise" bullshit. i could admire the asylum's hucksterism more so if they made movies that, well, you know, were good or, at the very least, worth a damn. haha, and it's what i like about theses movies. they are garbage. you put them in a toilet and then you flush. it worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies. it may become a cult classic among many fans. the gore scenes are effectives, there's not much i can say, it's a z flick that parody the new movie with samuel l. jackson, hell, it may be better so who knows!
