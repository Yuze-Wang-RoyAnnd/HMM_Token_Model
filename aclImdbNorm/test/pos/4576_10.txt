i recommend idiocracy to everyone. luke wilson is very funny, the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face several times. until the end, when i took a breath and realized just how close we are to mr. judge's vision of tomorrow.<br /><br />keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the mac commercials (justin long)as dr. lexus. i found his performance oscar-worthy, especially considering what oscars have been handed out for in the recent past...besides, he's cute.<br /><br />in short, idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names (the president's middle name is mountain dew), hospital visits cost $5 billion dollars, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all, and nobody cares about anything but money. all because only stupid people are breeding. sounds familiar to me, somehow. oh, yeah; it's what i think of when i see professional wrestling...<br /><br />seriously, watch this movie. it's a good laugh and it will make you think.
