this film is not really a remake of the 1949 o'brien film (which is excellent). it borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. but i like that the writers chose an english professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. the plot is also quite original. in general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. but what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected "noir" feel. dennis quaid grins inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments, but he's still compelling in a general way. meg ryan is fine as the student helper/love interest. when the film gets sort of bad is when dex (the prof) meets the british bodyguard/chauffeur and their duels are pretty laughable. the bodyguard works for the rich widow (played by lovely charlotte rampling), but those scenes are too self-consciously "noir" to help the film along, even though the family "plot line" is rather interesting. dex also keeps showing up at the same place and finding this bodyguard, which is rather coincidental. in the latter part of the film,a man is shot by a window, and from the outside you see him jump out of it--that was pretty bad direction. but aside from some of these obvious flaws, i think it still holds ok. i certainly didn't predict the ending, so that was good--there is a twist, and although some posters here think they were misled, i thought it was a fine and believable ending. dennis quaid, with his weird smirks and black eyes, is more likable in the right stuff, great balls of fire, inner space, and cold creek manor. but here as dex, he's supposed to be somewhat of a jerk, so he did fine. fairly decent movie.
