i have great memories of this movie...<br /><br />i was only 12 when it was released and it scared the bejesus out of me. i really miss my bejesus...<br /><br />zombies, graveyards, mausoleums, how can you go wrong? it's like phantasm's retarded cousin.<br /><br />this movie was released 1 year before the pg-13 rating was instituted.<br /><br />i submit that one dark night is the goriest pg movie (not scariest, mind you) that has ever been released.<br /><br />can anyone come up with a gorier pick?<br /><br />(fyi: i don't consider poltergeist to be gorier...scarier, yes. but not gorier...)
