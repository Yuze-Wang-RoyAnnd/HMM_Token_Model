in a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! it is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. nothing has been this good since married with children. kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses! and believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. these guys truly understand what is funny. i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing koq just once. other funny people in this show are carrie, janet heffernan, spence and doug pruzan (carrie's boss). i'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers. check it out if you haven't!!
