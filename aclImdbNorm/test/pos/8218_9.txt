if you're actually reading this review, i give you a lot of credit. you care enough to actually look up this movie, which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review! so for your reading pleasure...<br /><br />i'm assuming you know the plot line already so i won't waste time typing that out. i will mention that sandra bullock did an amazing job with this movie. she really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. i can say this because i happen to be a computer programmer.<br /><br />anyway, i thought the basic plot was a very good one. you can easily build sub-plots upon its mainframe and turn it into a very enjoyable movie. the premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken.<br /><br />to make a long review short...oops! too late! if you enjoy sandra bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time, take a look at this little gem. you won't be disappointed. :-)
