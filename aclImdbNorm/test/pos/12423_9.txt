great horror comedy from michael davis.iwas laughing so hard i almost peed! great acting from eric jungman as the good guy who saves the day & great performance by the jack black-esquire like performance from justin urich. he was just divine in this film. this guy deserves to be a big star. also,aimee brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of jeepers creepers. the gore to was given in copious amounts & i loved it.i just hope they release a not rated version. great low-budget horror comedy. the dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny! ***** out of *****
