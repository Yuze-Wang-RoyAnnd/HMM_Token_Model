be prepared for the trip to haneke's "la pianiste"...the psychological sickness of the main character, wonderfully played by huppert, goes beyond any limit you could expect. the most stunning part of it is that you start feeling compassion for the character erika. trash-sexuality (no nudes scenes though), perversion, masochism, incestuous relations...haneke gives us a crude meal, heavy to digest; sometimes, the only way you can escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it. the "mise en sc`ene" is maybe not the most appealing part of the movie, it has obvious austro-germanic, sometimes scandinavian notes : static, long scenes, but never boring. the vienna settings, the french language used, make the whole look like a european blend. the permanent germanic music background (schubert) is beautifully chosen. above all, both of the cannes awards for best actors are well deserved: one of the greatest performance of the year by one of the greatest french actress ever.
