"five fingers of death" started the american kung-fu movie craze but i remember seeing it for the first time as "king boxer" in chinatown, nyc, without the bad dubbing and few americans. i also was fortunate enough to see the american premiere of "five fingers of death" on times square, nyc. what a contrast this turned out to be...same film but different audiences.<br /><br />in chinatown, this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers. it was because of hearing the real voices of the actors(in chinese) that made this movie more believable. chinatown theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years(1972's "boxer from shantung" beat them all in gore), so the action choreography & story were the main attraction. rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh. every great kung fu film had wonderful, dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and ffod had them too. the star, lieh lo, was a known actor in chinese theaters. the mostly chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. the audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me.<br /><br />on times square, this film was an action comedy...probably unintentionally. i enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. the crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. from the start, the movie made you laugh. as soon as the audience heard those strange british accents come from those chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon. most american audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film. the action sequences blew the audience away. unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that, bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula.<br /><br />i had fun seeing this movie with an american audience but enjoyed it much more in chinatown. some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of ffod can't. the original "king boxer" is still enjoyable...a classic!
