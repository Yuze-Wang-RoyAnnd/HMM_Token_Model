american-made final entry in the "blood island" series of filipino horror films concerns abdul amir (reed hadley), ruler of a fictional country. he dies of cancer, yet it's figured out how to bring him back: put his brain into a donor body. the mad doctor in charge (kent taylor) puts it in a highly unlikely body: the facially scarred giant manservant named gor (john bloom). a doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors' plans.<br /><br />film-making partners samuel m. sherman (producer) and al adamson (director) corral several actors they've worked with before, including taylor, adamsons' sexy wife regina carrol, angelo rossitto, zandor vorkov, and vicki volante. they tried to go for the feel of the previous "blood island" entries but one can tell this was made stateside. while not necessarily a "good" film, it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole. a malevolent dwarf (rossitto), gory operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job on bloom, the political intrigue subplot, caverns full of cobwebs, etc. the narrative is actually pretty coherent, with plot twists thrown in here and there. i think it could have been trimmed a bit; some scenes drag. but it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect.<br /><br />for this kind of thing, the acting isn't too bad. both taylor and rossitto are fun; the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role. volante is appealing enough, and williams is o.k. in the heroic role. in any event, it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films.<br /><br />absolutely nothing special, but as a trashy b "horror" (i use the word loosely, none of this is exactly scary) film, it certainly amuses.<br /><br />7/10
