this horror movie is definitely one of the best ones i have seen in my life and there are many reasons why. the storyline is really good it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it the actors are not very good but there are not that bad but kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a good actor also the cast is very good such as kane as jacob goodnight, christina vidal as christine, michael j. pagan as tye, samantha noble as kira etc. also i just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but they are very creative but that just makes it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore also they look very realistic. so i am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie. so make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great.<br /><br />overall score: ********** out of ********** <br /><br />***** out of *****
