this movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up with the realization that the emperor is indeed naked. our election process is unclothed and dismal. my awareness is heightened and i want to see the world change. after a short while i am lulled back to my little complacency and "bubble life." in the best sense of film this work will ferment into an edible stew for me and like in "network" i want to be convicted to say'i'm as mad as hell, and i'm not going to take this anymore!' but to whom? my vigorous youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to concerned parent with quiet convictions or rather "beliefs." "man of the year" reveals how much i yearn for honest and sometimes humorous takes on our current political situation. dobbs' line " i did inhale because i thought 'what the hell,it's lit, it's in my hand, i'll inhale it.'" was refreshing or would've been when clinton was president. why can't politicians be honest and set that tone for debates? we people must realize how much veneer is being put forth as real? i am sick of this election process already,anyone else? let take off the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to task (not re-elect) when they continue with evasion and non-representation of citizenry. this movie can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians that spew rhetoric. great film!
