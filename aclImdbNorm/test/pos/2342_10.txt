i saw one life stand when it premiered at the 2000 edinburgh international film festival and was blown away by it. made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a european film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of dv. the film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. one life stand avoids falling into the trap of other uk realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes. the performances are strong, particularly maureen carr as the mother, trise. i understand the film has recently been released on dvd and i would definitely recommend it. the rating on this site is misleading, which is why i gave it a high score because the filmmaker, may miles thomas obviously put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for her amazing achievement.
