an amazing film, i've only just seen it and i already want to see it again. i'd never heard of derek jarman before i saw this film but now i am, i can't wait to see his others. the film takes a whole new perspective of shakespeare's the tempest, i'm sure he'd have appreciated it for jarman's use of the the play's themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension. ok, ok there may have been a bit of nudity in the film which i hadn't really anticipated but it didn't offend me, it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable. one spoiler (for those of a nervous disposition: fast forward the flashback scene with sycorax & caliban and ariel as their slave, its pretty graphic. overall, if you are starting to find kenneth branagh's shakespeare performances flaccid and monotonous then you need to see this film. fantastic and surreal, it'll blow you away, but only if you let it. have an open mind - and then let this film work it's magic on you.
