affable aspiring cartoonist hoops mccann (a wonderfully engaging performance by john cusack) and his best buddy george (the deliciously deadpan joel murray) go to nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. hoops, george, and several newfound pals come to the aid of cassandra (demi moore at her most charming), a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy beckersted clan. writer/director savage steve holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. the constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist. moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: bobcat goldthwait as the spastic egg stork, tom villard as his goofy brother clay, curtis armstrong as the sweet ack ack raymond, mark metcalf as evil rich jerk aquilla beckersted, matt mulhern as the mean teddy, kimberly foster as the fetching cookie, joe flaherty as the gung-ho general raymond, william hickey as cranky old man beckersted, jeremy piven as smug preppy bully ty, and john matuszak as hulking biker stan. isidore mankofsky's slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, cory lerios' cool rockin' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. single funniest scene: egg in a godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. an absolute hoot.
