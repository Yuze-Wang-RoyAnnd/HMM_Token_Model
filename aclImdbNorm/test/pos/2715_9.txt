comeundone, i love you! i could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. my family has not seen this movie yet, but i know them too well; they will hate it. but this time, i watched it alone and i found that it affected me greatly. although the movie is long in length, i was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. i initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />but like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality. instead, it challenges it and the viewer to think strongly about what the word "normal" means. it also gives you the insight to personally think about what the ending means, i can say that i loved how it turned out and i'm happy for mithi.
