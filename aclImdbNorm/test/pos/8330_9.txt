we bought the dvd of "walking with dinosaurs" and have been nearly ecstatic over the things that are done so very well on it.<br /><br />many dvds today offer the bare minimum ... the feature itself, and maybe one other language (which doesn't help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to see the dvd in multiple markets). <br /><br />not so in the case of wwd. there are so many wonderful extras and well-thought-out vignettes that watching even the *navigation menu* is interesting. the intros to each chapter in "the making of" dvd are laugh-out-loud funny. the quality of the sound and video is terrific. and of course the story and content ... what more could a dinosaur lover ask for?<br /><br />i did watch most of the version broadcast on tdc (narrated by avery brooks) then watched about half of the dvd (narrated by kenneth branaugh). as near as i can tell, the broadcast version slipped in a number of mostly american slang terms in the narration (i.e. in a section about t. rex mating, branugh says "the female is tiring of the male's attention" and brooks says, "the honeymoon is over")and cut out some of the closer-in puppet work. i prefer the branugh version simply because it is more complete.<br /><br />overall, a great value and wonderful production. many kudos to the bbc and the crew that made this gem.
