belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. the most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. i don't think besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. i think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight. though i wasn't glued to the screen, upon reflection i see that it's a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. its vehicle is the stylized sci-fi movie. part of its reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of its humans is not necessarily played as a perfect human being: the hero, a lone drifter in the desolate new world, is taken in by an older recluse, who refuses to keep his part of an exchange of food between him and a husky, brutish character played by jean reno, and so reno tries everything he can, predominantly using brute force, to get what he wants. so, the antagonist is right, though not a good person, and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong, though they are both good people.<br /><br />it's shot in a clear and crisp black and white, edited and captured in a low-key yet spry and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. how can they not be? they, like their characters are left with the bare necessities of communication. this is one of the few truly good films that luc besson has written. his earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he churns out now.
