this was a great movie. it had one "sot-so-nice" outburst. plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.<br /><br />for a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. it held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.<br /><br />this movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. the dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot. the pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing.<br /><br />we hope you like as much as we did.
