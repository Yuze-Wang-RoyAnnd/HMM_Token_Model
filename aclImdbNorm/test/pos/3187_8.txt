i am trying to find somewhere to purchase a dvd/vhs copy of the movie "isn't it shocking?" i was 7 years old when i saw this movie and i lived in the town where it was filmed. a couple of items from my family were used in the movie as props and a couple of my friend's homes were used in a couple of the scenes. the filming pretty well took place in the town and surrounding community. i have only seen the film once originally and i would like to get a copy so now i can show my family the film. i have done extensive searches online with not luck and i was wondering if anyone would have any ideas on trying to get a copy of this movie?
