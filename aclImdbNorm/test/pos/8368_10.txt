i was born in beijing, china and moved to the united states at the age of 9. been home to beijing several times since and loved it each time. one of the many things i love about beijing is the people and the ambiance they bring to the city. "you hau hao hao shuo" (which translate more accurately to "if you have something to say, say it nicely") delightfully and truthfully captures that feeling of beijing. i suppose you would have to have lived in and kinda understood beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, though you might enjoy it regardless.<br /><br />> the story is not complicated, intentionally kinda quirky, and captivating. i will leave it to unfold by itself and not tell you too much except some comments. each detail, from the pictures on the wall, to the decorations, the streets, and restaurants feels like home. (zhang yimou most likely shot everything "on location") but more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the kind-hearted but unfortunate "laptop man", and the night club owner are each native to beijing and lovable in their distinct ways. their conversations really capture the essence of each character. the story, mostly driven by situations and conversation (save the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is intriguing and always interesting.<br /><br />> i am 21 now. my parents and i love this movie. we are always so amazed by zhang yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into believable screen characters, and everyday life into extraordinary situations.<br /><br />"keep cool" - different. hilarious. meaningful.
