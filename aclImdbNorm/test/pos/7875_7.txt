imagine that "dragnet" episode where friday and gannon go into a typical 1970 den of hippie inequity, but instead of giving everyone a lecture, they "get some." that's "joe" in a nutshell.<br /><br />this film of a working-class bigot and a rich guy who's just killed his girlfriend's drug-dealer boyfriend has dated terribly and most of the supporting acting is stilted, but it's still interesting to watch. peter boyle, then about 35, plays joe (the bigot), and he looks like james gandolfini. in her film debut, susan sarandon plays the doe-eyed daughter, and while she doesn't necessarily hint at her future greatness, you can't take your eyes off her.
