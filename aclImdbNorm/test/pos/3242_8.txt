i'm a fan of independent film. dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. some of the other posts are right: "wannabes" isn't going to rival "the godfather" for best mob film ever. on the other hand, "wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. my problem with one of the other reviews:<br /><br />- conor dubin stands out as the only irishman in a cast of italians<br /><br />- dubin is a jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an irishman. he doesn't stand out at all, rather, delivers a great performance.<br /><br />this didn't win many awards, but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. i found it for 7 bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! highly recommended.
