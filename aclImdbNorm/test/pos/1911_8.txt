a blaxploitation classic, this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the "toasts" that rudy ray moore performs. toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point, and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap. for more on toasts, rudy ray moore, and why this movie is important, go to dolemite.com.<br /><br />which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself. this movie packs in a great deal of "laugh-at-the-funny-outfits-and-hairstyles" bang for the buck, as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue. it starts as dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice. i was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence, but that's me, i'm a neophyte in the prison scene. he is helped in this by queen bee, who is dolemite's lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while he's been gone. she has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters.<br /><br />i watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it provided an interesting contrast. the first part i watched on my lunch break while exercising, and wasn't enjoying it much at all. it struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation, with a ludicrous story, shoddy craftsmanship
