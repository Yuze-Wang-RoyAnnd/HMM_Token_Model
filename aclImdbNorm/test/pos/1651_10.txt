rififi, directed by jules dassin, is in line with the melville crime pictures (particularly bob le flameur and to a point le cercle rouge) of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn't need, and was ahead of its time. ionically, it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for selves than for others, a kind of duty) that rings well in post-ww2 france. its actors carry faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about', and from there the story takes off. maybe it's because i have a weak spot for heist pictures, particularly where we see just the nuts and bolts (err, actual physical side) of how a heist is pulled off.<br /><br />one of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast (i.e. snatch), or done in ways we've seen too many times before. dassin, like melville years later, decided to create practically a silent film of a heist, sound effects included. the tension that builds up in this scene may not top what melville had in 'rouge', but on its own level it achieves its own greatness and momentum, and just as crucial originality to what's been done before. there are some kept close-ups, for example, as the safe is being cracked, that mark some of the best i've seen from france at that time. an added plus for the film, aside from the larval-stage new-wave touch to the film, which in the end makes it a little more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. it becomes completely about character at points, and then keeps up the thrills. the last ten to fifteen minutes are down-right miraculous; like with another classic heist picture the asphalt jungle, it's not even the last stop that matters, but all about how much one will go past the call of duty, putting humanism over greed.<br /><br />you almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that he might just make it. dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of its genre, with a nifty little musical number as well.
