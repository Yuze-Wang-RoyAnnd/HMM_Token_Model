while this film might not be the next evil dead ( hell who knows maybe it will, it has only been out for a year) it is worth a look. don't expect a $10 million film. cuz you'll be disappointed. do expect to be entertain, to laugh, and to enjoy the experience.all in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there. i have seen films that spent more than 10 or 20 times what this film cost to make and turned out 10000000000 times worse. the effort that was put into this film far out weighs the set backs it faces by having a limited budget. movies are meant to entertain, and this movie sure does that. in fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching. it's available on netflix if not your local video rental store. so watch it, then decide.
