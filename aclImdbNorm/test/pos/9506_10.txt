as other reviews have stated, there are a few missing videos from this collection, but what is on this disc is overwhelming. there are two separate soundtracks, an original recording and a completely redone new performance version. any new music from the residents is welcome, and i suppose for a first time listener, the new version may be more ear-friendly, but i prefer the original recordings (probably simply because they are "the originals". production of this dvd is amazing, new and old videos are all interesting, with live performance videos probably the least interesting of what is offered (although the snippets of live recordings hidden as easter eggs are extremely welcome). this is not a renter, this is a must own collection. enjoy.
