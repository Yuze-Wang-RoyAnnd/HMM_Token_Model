this movie was borderline in crude humor....i utterly can not believe that these people can get away with this. johnny knoxville didn't cross the line...he was stomping all over it! this was better than the first...all tha way! the thing i found about the 1st movie was that the shenanigans were somewhat as if it was on the t.v. show. not this time!!! they completely made a 180 degree flip...the whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and not were the stunts crazy...but the music basically fit every situation...good work!!!! when you go see this be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater, maintain a strong stomach and rememba to not let your beverage spray out your nose....
