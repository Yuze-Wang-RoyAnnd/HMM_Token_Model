i saw this film many years ago (along with another of shepitko's films, wings) as part of a soviet film series at a local film archive. but none of shepitko's films, as far as i can tell, have ever made it to video or dvd in the united states. ascent is a great film by any standard, with stunning black and white photography, hypnotic direction, and actors so deep into their roles that you have no sense of them merely giving a performance. although the period details of russian resistance to (and collaboration with) german occupation are very telling, the story is timeless. two russian partisans are captured by the germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity as well as their courage. i suspect the reason why it has not been released on dvd by the russians (here comes the spoiler) is that the jewish intellectual (and not the tough russian peasant) is the partisan who resists both threats and temptation, goes serenely to his death, and sets an heroic example for the villagers.
