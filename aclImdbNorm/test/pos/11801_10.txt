let me start out with saying i was very surprised with the production value of this movie. i managed to catch an early showing and i have to say this is the best (if not only) christian film to hit theaters since the passion.<br /><br />don't let the pg-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. this is definitely a movie that a junior high youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. the best part is this is not a film for christians, it is a family film without the cheesy 7th heaven feel.<br /><br />the laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and i was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. the plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of "the word", but instead people just trying to understand life. humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot.<br /><br />the acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy christian rhetoric. this is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). if you want to see a quality family film in january check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself.<br /><br />and i am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie.
