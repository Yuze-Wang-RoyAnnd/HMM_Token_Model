i was very disappointed when this show was canceled. although i can not vote. i live on the island of aruba. i sat down to see the show on tuesday. and was very surprised that it didn't aired. the next day i read on the internet that it was canceled.<br /><br />it's true not every one was as much talented as the other. but there were very talented people singing.<br /><br />i find it very sad for them.<br /><br />that they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling down.<br /><br />its a pity<br /><br />ariette croes
