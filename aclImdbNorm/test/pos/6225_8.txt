i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child. thanks to the search feature of plots i was able to find out the name of it. for years i did not know the name, but the movie stuck in my mind. the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually. it was a shame it did not make it to a series. this movie reminds me of journey to the far side of the sun. also known as doppleganger. if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch. it was done before the stranger, but shares a similar plot. yet different. i just picked up the stranger off of ebay on vhs. hope they make a dvd, but it is doubtful unless it comes out on dollar dvd. a few pilots are making it on the budget dvd's and maybe this one will.
