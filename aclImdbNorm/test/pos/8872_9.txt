i thought that the interplay between crystal and devito was great. the movie is rather off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. ramsey as "momma" is vulgar and over the top, but also very funny and effective. the character has to be pretty awful for why else would someone entertain thoughts of killing his mother? now crystal's wife -- she is a "slut" whom everyone would like to receive her comeuppance, thus her role, though minor, is also effective, because it has to justify crystal's ridiculous case of "writer's block." while there are certainly dark moments, the movie is not depressing and, despite the murderous urges that the protagonists feel, they have redeeming qualities too.<br /><br />overall, this is one of the funniest movies i can remember, one that i don't mind watching over several times.
