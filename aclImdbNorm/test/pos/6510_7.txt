okay, i think we're all agreed that michael jackson was the low point.<br /><br />and the special effects too. but, please, keep in mind that this was not a big-budget film, okay? not every film gets as much of a budget as harry potter or star wars.<br /><br />however, i thought it was pretty funny altogether. b-? nothing that would, in my opinion, waste your time.<br /><br />parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad.<br /><br />i think this was a good movie, if weak at some points.<br /><br />hope this comment helps. ~angela
