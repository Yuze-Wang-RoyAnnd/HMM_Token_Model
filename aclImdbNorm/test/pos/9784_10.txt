critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever. watchers also claim the same. but there is a flip side to that coin. they are wrong, very wrong. it's the most clever film i've seen in ages...<br /><br />from beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic. a story that reflexes the real world. this film is like a mirror. you see yourself in another way that people see you. to really understand the directors point of view, you have to see it another time...<br /><br />when you see this film...try to understand the story (and watch the background)...listen to the lyrics of the music...and smell the industrial complexes...<br /><br />this film is one of a kind. you'll hate it(most people do), or you'll love it(and understand it completely)<br /><br />ernest hemmingway once said:'the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for'. i agree with the second part.
