so i turned on the tv today at 1:00 pm on a sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just starting, didn't know what it was but drew me in almost immediately. the movie was excellent.<br /><br />there were a couple of things that didn't make sense for one i don't get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation, but then jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words it wasn't his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck, second i don't get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing panda's money, and then the other thief kills panda at the end, so they steal his money twice, and kill him how is that good?
