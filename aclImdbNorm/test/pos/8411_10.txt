i've always loved "gone with the wind" and have seen it numerous times. however, its ending left me not only "hanging," but depressed, with a hopeless feeling. finally, in "scarlett," ripley took us to a very plausible and satisfying end ("beginning") of the original story.<br /><br />it follows that someone of scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up. although, like most people, i fell in love with scarlett in gwtw, i tired of her constant insipid infantiilism to the point of exasperation, and i was disappointed that mitchell did not show scarlett using that obvious intelligence to even make an attempt to grow emotionally. thankfully, someone finally did. (after all, isn't that nagging immaturity that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence the very reason rhett finally gave up on her in the first place?) i think ripley did an excellent job of describing that long-overdue process, and whalley-kilmer did a superb job of portraying it. joanne w-k has all the fire, exuberance and intelligent sparkle as did vivian leigh, and she is certainly at least as, if not more, beautiful.<br /><br />there was, is, and always will be only one clark gable. however, if i had to pick an actor out of the thousands to which i've been exposed to portray him in his biography, it would definitely be timothy dalton. dalton possesses the same elegant charm that gable did, which is essential for rhett's character. i can't imagine anyone else who could come close.<br /><br />in my opinion, both joanne whalley-kilmer and timothy dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have possibly played scarlett and rhett. i think both their performances did justice to not only the late actors but also the spirit of their characters.<br /><br />i enjoyed the whole cast. julie harris was her usual delightful presence, and jean smart was an adorable kick! even ashley's character was nicely played by stephen collins, and the progression of his relationship with scarlett was totally believable.<br /><br />the story became a little convoluted in ireland, but so is life, after all, and i still found it entertaining.<br /><br />all in all, i thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of ripley's imagination. i wish i'd written it!<br /><br />
