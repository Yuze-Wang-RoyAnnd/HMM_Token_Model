when one watches romantic comedies, one knows what to expect; we've seen enough of them over many, many years to know how they go. there's a formula, one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genre's audience... not always in relation to their actual quality. how to play around with that, and create something more interesting? this movie has a suggestion... and it works relatively well. instead of simply following a lead, we follow him skillfully helping the unfortunate men, those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with. the plot follows smith as he works on his self-proclaimed most difficult such case; kevin james. alongside his aid of james, we also follow mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want(one particular scene that inspires great respect of smith's character is him meeting one such jerk, and putting him in his place). after seeing smith helping the disaster that is james, we see him with mendes... and in spite of his talent for helping others, he messes up... badly... with her. making a marvelous point about love, and how falling in love affects us. for a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such(at times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre), though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films. whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. the pace is quite good, it never really slows down, and seldom moves too fast. the acting is great, as far as pretty much everyone goes. the characters are nicely developed, and come off as real people. the humor doesn't always work... there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed, and one or two jokes that seem forced. however, for the most part, the film was funny. i recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love. those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. 7/10
