i've never seen a movie get a worse release then this. and that's a shame, as this is the funniest film of the year! you would think an ad with the line "from the director of "office space"" would be enough to warrant a big release! but there are no ads, no posters, no website , i doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. what is 20th century fox thinking? mike judge's sci-fi comedy is set in 2505 but it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) luke wilson and maya rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards. the film reminds me of woody allen's "sleeper" ,"robocop", "planet of the apes", "blade runner" and "network" and the late great "futurama". try to see it before fox burns all the prints!
