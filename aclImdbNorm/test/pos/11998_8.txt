this is, without a doubt, one of my favorite columbo episodes ever. the acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is ingenious, and the direction is fabulous.<br /><br />peter falk, who acts brilliantly in every columbo episodes, acts particularly well in this episode.<br /><br />also, great performances from stephen caffrey, gary hershberger, alan fudge and robert culp.<br /><br />the ending is absolutely brilliant and i love the way columbo describes it.<br /><br />this is a columbo movie that won't, go amiss.
