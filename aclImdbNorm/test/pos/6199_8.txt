*be warned of possible spoilers*<br /><br />a friend told me to check out this series, and i'm glad i took her words for it.<br /><br />i read the synopsis on the dvd cover and i was immediately intrigued. the main protagonist is muslim? no way, this is a first! it's about an fbi agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in la; and get this - he is a practicing muslim. i was a little skeptical at first, half-expecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly, gratuitous and mindless holier-than-thou fanatic drivels... let's face it, a lot of shows have been guilty of this.<br /><br />but then i watched the first three episodes, and i thought: okay, this is good. it wasn't until episode four ("scholar") when i was well and truly impressed. i would like to commend on the great writing and also, superb performances from the actors. i just love how complex every one of these characters - they're not straight out two-dimensional cardboard cutout good guys/bad guys. michael ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the muslim fbi agent darwyn al-sayeed, treading the fine line between being the good muslim and being a man with flaws. oded fehr gives his character farik an interesting depth - farik is not the typical oily middle eastern stereotype, but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesn't see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs. he's very charismatic and authoritative. but i would say that it was alex nesic's performance that clearly left an impression in me in "scholar". his portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing - torn between the softly spoken words of a muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the non-aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in god's eye and farik's persuasion to believe otherwise.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to watch more shows like this, and not some ridiculously high-octane one man show series. it's clever and open-minded.
