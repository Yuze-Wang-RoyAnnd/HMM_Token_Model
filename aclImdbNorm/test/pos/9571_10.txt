this movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. its cousins a mighty wind, spinal tap and waiting for guffman are terrific in their own right but best in show takes the cake. <br /><br />a movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively, it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good. after watching the movie about 75 times i have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. there is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film. <br /><br />if you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as i am billing it as, watch it again. the first time i saw it i thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious. it is a film that grows on you. defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently. <br /><br />characters: hamilton and meg swan: a+ if you get the dvd check out how these characters were "born" amazing that these two could hit it so on the head. and to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went. <br /><br />gerry and cookie guggleman: a cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character. gerry (eugene levy) delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half. <br /><br />stefan vanderhoof and scott donalan- a+ find me a funnier character than scott donalan, i dare you! he will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. stefan (micheal mckean) was very good as well and they interplay here (and a brief appearance with the gugglemans) goes to show why he is always in these films. a great actor with razor like wit. <br /><br />harlan pepper- b+, i don't want it to seem like he isn't funny, he sure is but being the only "solo" act he can't be quite as funny as the others above. he does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him.<br /><br />the rest are all great as well, there is no weak character. see this film at least twice. buy it, you will not regret it.
