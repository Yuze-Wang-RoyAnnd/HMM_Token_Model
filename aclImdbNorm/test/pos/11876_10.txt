brought philip larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time, and not just the ones that are measured by popularity. it shows a stark portrayal of larkins life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era - which is exactly how he would have wanted it, such was his disdain for cankers and medallions. it dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of philips observations of our relationship with our own mortality, and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers. for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life, love and death this is a must.
