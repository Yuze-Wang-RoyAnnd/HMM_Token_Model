when precious bane aired in america, i was stunned by this beautiful story. all the actors were brilliant; clive owen really understood the character he played. i went right away to a bookstore and ordered the original novel, which is even more beautiful, and which went out of print just after i bought the book - although i've seen it online a few times now. i had also hoped with the oscar won by janet mcteer and the huge popularity of clive owen the bbc would naturally get this fine production on dvd...i cannot believe all these years later we still have no dvd. it has to be the only production ever created by the bbc that is not for sale. come on bbc - you have money to make off us fans here. get this on dvd please!
