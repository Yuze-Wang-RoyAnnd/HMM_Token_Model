i liked this probably slightly more than terror by night though not enough to give it the extra *. the beginning is just brilliant, as we peek in on nazi agents scheming to get their hands on a new bomb sight and its inventor in a small swiss village, only to be foiled by a disguised holmes who spirits the scientist back to london. once there, he does everything he can to keep the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind it all -- not hitler, but worse: holmes' arch-enemy moriarty. of course the scientist disappears, leaving a tantalizing coded note, and holmes goes in pursuit, once again in disguise. a climax in moriarty's dockside lair is suitably exciting, and we can all guess that all ends well, can't we? slightly over-the-top patriotic message as the credits roll. now that i think of it, the fine sense of place despite the obvious sets, rathbone's use of disguise and the way in which so much plot is crammed into just over an hour -- what the heck it gets that extra * and is my favorite of the 5 rathbone/bruce films i've seen to date.<br /><br />watched on dvd, part of the "50 mystery classics" set from mill creek entertainment. many of the transfers on these el cheapo box sets are of very poor quality, but holmes fans take note that the rathbone/bruce films (there are 4 on this set) are all quite watchable and reasonably sharp.
