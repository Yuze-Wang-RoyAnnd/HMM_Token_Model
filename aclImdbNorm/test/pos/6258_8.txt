this little flick is reminiscent of several other movies, but manages to keep its own style & mood. "troll" & "don't be afraid of the dark" come to mind. the suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from g to pg. i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections. if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.
