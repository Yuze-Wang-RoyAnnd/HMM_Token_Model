this is a good film for die-hard chucky fans. okay i'm sure it's not as good as what the child's play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, chucky's laughs are hilarious.<br /><br />(spoilers)<br /><br />now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, jennifer tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.<br /><br />if you have seen the child's play movies this would be a worthy film on your chucky collection, but if you've never seen the child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start. of course you'll not have a clue on how chucky got into his current state (cause i'm not telling you) but you'll figure out why chucky is very popular.<br /><br />overall a very enjoyable movie.
