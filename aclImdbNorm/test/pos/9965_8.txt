michael radford, the director of "the merchant of venice" makes a tremendous job in opening the play, as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time at the movies watching this thorny account of a horrible time in history. the luscious production of the shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of the venice of the xvi century.<br /><br />this is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by william shakespeare. having seen the play a few times, we were not prepared about what to expect. mr. radford takes care of presenting the story with such detail so it can be easily understood by everyone. also, he has used a version of english that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text. in fact, the way shylock speaks in the film, doesn't shock at all, being he, a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the venetian authorities and the catholic church.<br /><br />al pacino tremendous portrayal of shylock shows a man that is vulnerable, arrogant, revengeful, mean, and totally human, all at the same time. mr. pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality. his own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be caving in on him. at the end of the film, we see a man that has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule by everyone.<br /><br />lynn collins, as portia is a happy discovery. having seen her in lighter fare, she not only surprises, but she makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera. she shows us she is a woman with a high intelligence, who comes to the help of her husband and his best friend, who risked his own well being in trying to help bassanio get portia's hand.<br /><br />jeremy irons plays antonio, the man who seeks shylock for a "bridge loan". after all, he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon. antonio gets much more than he bargained for in agreeing with shylock to the terms of the loan. antonio's best laid plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. mr. irons gives a subtle performance.<br /><br />joseph fiennes, makes a good appearance as bassanio. his good looks and his charm make an impression on portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young venetian as she knows he is the one for her. also, in smaller roles, kris marshall, zuleika robinson, charlie cox, contribute to make the film an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />ultimately, it's mr. radford's triumph because of the vision he gives us of venice and its citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind.
