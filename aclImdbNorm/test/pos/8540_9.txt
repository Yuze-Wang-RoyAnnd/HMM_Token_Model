the box at my video store is why i rented this one. it looked cool from the guys face axed in half so of course i had to give it a try. i was pleasantly surprised when i actually watched it being an "evil dead" fan. the swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece. a criminal tries to break into the house evil ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says "groovy" as he looks at his weapon quite like bruce campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in evil dead 2. there is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie. they don't just spoof evil dead, as there is a gremlin style puppet monster that cusses at ed in his refrigerator. my personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says "i'm coming to get you barbra" which in case you did'nt know is barbra's brothers main line in "night of the living dead". this movie pretty much has it all good plot, cool characters, funny stuff (gremlin puppet),scary stuff (demon doctor), excellent effects (exploding head) and a fair amount of female nudity. i only gave it a 9 because its kind of slow before ed goes insane but its well worth the wait. so if you liked "evil dead 2" or any of the other movies i mentioned above you gotta rent and watch it with a freind, and when your done try "brain dead" because i hear it is similiar to this masterpiece. <br /><br />
