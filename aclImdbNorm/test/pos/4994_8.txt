i am a big fan of lonesome dove and all the books in the series and i love the movie. i was happy to see that they finished up with comanche moon. i have been a long time fan of steve zahn and was eager to see him in a serious role. i personally think that steve zahn has done an amazing job of re-creating gus. i can't think of another actor who would have been better. he has the voice, the mannerisms, the pronunciation of word all down to a t. granted, no one could ever hold a candle to robert duvall as gus, but i think that steve zahn has done a pretty darn good job. karl urban acts the same in all the movies he has been in so he has made a good match for woodrow call. as for the movie itself, yeah it's a little corny but can you really beat lonesome dove? no, i don't think so.
