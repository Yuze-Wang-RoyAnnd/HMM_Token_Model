this movie is about a very delicate argument and if you are searching for something that makes you think here you are right. tim robbins has made a wonderful job and the result is a kind of docu-drama that should be shown in schools (for the strong themes treated). what about the actors? well, they are simply great; susan sarandon is truly 'the face of love' and sean penn is unbelievable as almost always. an absolutely must-see!
