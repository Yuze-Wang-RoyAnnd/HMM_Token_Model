alright, i'm 12, so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre-teen's point of view. i've also commented on magnolia and bicentennial man, both great movies, if you want to check it out. alright, here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye. the writer (i don't know who it was, check imdb) either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love, poetry, and drama. i cried 4 times throughout this movie, once for over 30 minutes. it was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. it's a great movie for anyone, say, 11 and up who isn't a romantic-comedy freak. yeah, it's romantic, yeah, it's comedic, but (in my opinion), it's better than "she's all that" or "whatever it takes". i never cry! it's a tender story. go rent it and tape it :).
