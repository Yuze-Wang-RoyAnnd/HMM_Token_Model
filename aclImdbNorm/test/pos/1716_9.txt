russell t davies has been tasked with re-creating a slice of my childhood: hiding behind the sofa, watching scary monsters battle with dr who. he, and his crew, are clearly all true devotees of the original series.<br /><br />in much the same way as the star trek movies used their budget to make the gene rodenberry's original concept far more believable, russell t davies has both money and the advantages of excellent cgi to create the best monsters ever. i am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and dvd sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared.<br /><br />the accompanying series dr who confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight. interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again.<br /><br />how does david tenant rank in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors? time will tell but tonight, seeing billie piper play alongside elisabeth sladen, who was the doctor's companion in the 1970's confirm that she has both the acting ability, screen presence and script to be the no. 1.
