i loved this film and recommend it to anyone who like a good spy spoof and who thought johnny english was an embarrassment. this is the film je should have been. but it's based on an old french films series so it's not really bond related.<br /><br />the production is brilliant, you'll almost believe the film was shot back in the 60's. it even has that same pastel kind of colouring films had in those days. jean dujardin plays his part with just the right amount of dumbness and naivety, not with ham fisted pantomime silliness like rowan atkinson and even if you don't like the film, you will want to see it for berenice bejo. ooh la la! she is the hotness ...
