the jazz soundtrack makes this seem like a clint eastwood movie.<br /><br />in fact the whole thing strikes me as burt doing clint. the story is good and the movie is full of one liners that i carry with me to this day. (reynolds to bad guy: i'm gonna pull the chain on you pal, because you're f'n up my town. and you wanna know the worst part? you're from outta state!)<br /><br />highlights: the technics 1500b reel to reel is nice set dressing for audiophiles!<br /><br />charles durning coming unglued while listening to wiretap tapes of prostitutes having (sort of) phone sex. (you'd have to see it, trust me, it's hilarious.)<br /><br />brian keith plays against type as a tough guy. (and does it well!)<br /><br />bernie casie's preoccupation with zen.<br /><br />rachel ward. wow! (where'd she go?)<br /><br />doc severinsen and the tonight show band play their rears off as usual. (joe william's guests on vocals. manhattan transfer re-recorded "route 66".) the soundtrack lends class to the whole affair.<br /><br />need i say more? it might be reynold's best film ever. <br /><br />(yeah, he plays himself, as usual, but it works!)<br /><br />enjoy!
