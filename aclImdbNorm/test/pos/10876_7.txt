i was actually satisfied when i played this game.the graphics were something new.the missions were great.but yet,i felt i wanted more out of this game.for a james bond game its pretty good but not as good as his other games.it would be great if they could make a 360remake for it.it would be much better then.this may just be cuz i'm into games as resident evil,dead rising and those kind of games.so it could be better but it was ok to play.one thing i absolutely hated about this game was natalya!she was irritating dying all the time and she couldn't run either.i recommend this game for those who like fps games more than i do.7/10 stars
