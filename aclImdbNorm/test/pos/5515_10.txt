a lot of people give this movie a lot of crap, and all of it's really undeserved. people give this movie a hard time either because it's such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it. if, just by looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable...don't watch it! however, you'd be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990's, despite what anyone else says.<br /><br />dee snider is wonderful here as captain howdy, the depths of insanity he plumbs to play this character has to be beyond words, and is much farther than any one of us would have to be willing to go. the acting here is wonderful. the film itself beautifully shot. the subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow, but it's still well worth your time. if you haven't seen this movie, check it out.
