this was essentially a remake of "diagnosis murder" minus victoria rowell, scott baio & charlie schlatter. dick is playing a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and can't even find his own classroom. barry is now a private eye, not related to dick. this lets barry shoot at guys speeding away from him, which a cop can not do. barry still gets the girl in the end. tracey needham portrays the girl. she is the prime suspect and dick and barry believe she's innocent and prove it. that's all the spoiler you get. the ending is sufficiently unexpected that you don't already know it half way through the movie.<br /><br />don't take it seriously. don't critique it. just sit back and enjoy dick and barry van dyke.
