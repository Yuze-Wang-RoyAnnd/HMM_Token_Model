the movie is a very good movie.one of the best from yash raj films.the direction is incredible.the screenplay is brilliant.the story is excellent.it tells about rahul who is obssed of kiran his college friend.he is a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone(anyway she died 15 years back) etc.kiran is engaged to sunil.rahul does everything so he can get her.he even trys to kill sunil but he survives it.he even goes to the place where they are going to their honeymoon.the movie is every nes delight.shahrukh is superb,juhi is fairly good,sunny is average,anupham is okay and so is tanvi,dalip did good.the movie belongs to srk.the dialogues are brilliant(shahrukh ones and a lot if not the overacting and comedy)."jaadu teri nazar" and "tu mere samne" are absolutely melodious tracks.
