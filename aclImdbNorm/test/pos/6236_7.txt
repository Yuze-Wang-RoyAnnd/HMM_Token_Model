this is a bizarre oddity, directed by the guy who edited "the texas chainsaw massacre." chuck conners gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the owner of a roadside "wax" museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near. the wax figures look "so real," one of the teen's points out. heh, heh, heh...not so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned "house of wax"-style terror. i can think of many, many horror films that are worse than this one.
