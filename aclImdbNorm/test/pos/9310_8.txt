okay maybe it was because i happen to be in yangchun china when i saw this movie. maybe it was because i finally had something on tv i could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just funny. whatever it was this movie was worth the time.<br /><br />i had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so i could watch tv. usually i would turn the darn thing off but i stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked.<br /><br />the plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star. if you like iron chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality tv mode, then you will love the scenes with food in this movie.<br /><br />it goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one. however the action is mostly slapstick so you don't always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea.<br /><br />the main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isn't bad to look at either. they are both worth watching. finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isn't a bad choice for both.<br /><br />i don't speak a word of chinese but i was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film. for those who do speak chinese maybe it is even better. overall i give this an 8 out of 10 and currently i am even looking to find a copy to have while i stay in china, and keep for when i come back home, it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in yangchun and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie.
