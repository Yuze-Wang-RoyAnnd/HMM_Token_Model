mr. bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy. he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit, a massive budget, a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant. and mr. bean is one of those characters who you just can't forget. some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they're not realistic at all and they're all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness. rowan atkinson and co. always manage to cook up interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when mr. bean drove his green mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof? mr. bean is one of those things that never gets weak - the movie wasn't as good as this, but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world, and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor. "extras" and "little britain" can be damned - this is british comedy at its best and most original. these escapades never get old! 10/10
