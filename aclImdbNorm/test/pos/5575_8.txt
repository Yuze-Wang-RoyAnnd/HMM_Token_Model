i remember ignoring the tv series when it first debuted because of its 'look' with the jim hensen muppets. however, recently a friend let me borrow his farscape dvds, and i am just now realizing what a terrible mistake that was. <br /><br />as with any tv series, there are episodes that shine and those that don't. i ride the adrenaline and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer through the lackluster ones. however, i endure regardless because of the core storyline that ties all the episodes together. what i'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. let me warn you, it is something that is absolutely irresistible to watch. i cannot recall any other tv series (babylon 5, buffy, angel, etc) that smartly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking (at times) and suspenseful ride.<br /><br />i think that at the end of the fourth season, things were finally becoming tightly focused and i am shocked at the decision to cancel the series. i wait anxiously for the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
