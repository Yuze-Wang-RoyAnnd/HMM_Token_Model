good film.<br /><br />i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale. lb2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. thing is the film is named "to kill for". it took a little detective work to find out it's original name.<br /><br />in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell". having seen final destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.<br /><br />maybe the fact the delightful, traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18. such a shame.<br /><br />traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions. she ability to turn what is branded a b-movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
