beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful, elegiac work of art. the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in, makes you want to touch the screen. the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. or, to put it another way, an old man. i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds. nearly all the people in this film are beautiful, unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo, that is. the dialogue doesn't really matter too much, not that there is much of it anyway, and as for storylines, forget it. some films exist just as visual experiences, this is one of them. don't bother if you want "simple entertainment",this not for you.<br /><br /> i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but i won't. if you are at all interested in cinematography, photography, film direction etc., watch this film.
