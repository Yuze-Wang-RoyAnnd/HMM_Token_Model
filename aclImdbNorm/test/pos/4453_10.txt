cult-director lucio fulci is probably most famous for his gory zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the "godfather of gore". fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. "non si sevizia un paperino" aka. "don't torture a duckling" of 1972 is not only by far fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre. the stunning atmosphere and tantalizing suspense, the great sizilian setting, the intriguing story the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock - i don't know what to praise most about this ingenious giallo! "don't torture a duckling" truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect, which makes it an absolute masterpiece of italian horror cinema.<br /><br />contrary to other gialli, it is not seductive beauty queens who are slain one by one, but little boys who fall victims to a killer on the loose. bodies of little boys are found in rural sicily. while the police are desperately searching for the killer, the little town is basically full of strange people, and the townsfolk are screaming for a culprit...<br /><br />the film is stunningly suspenseful and uncompromising from the very beginning, with a gritty, dark, and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal. the acting performances are among the best in italian horror cinema. tomas milian (one of my personal all-time favorite actors) is excellent in the lead, as journalist andrea martinelli who is investigating the crimes. sexy barbara bouchet delivers both eye-candy and a brilliant performance. equally outstanding performances come from irene papas and florinda bolkan, who is utterly brilliant in her role. the great score by riz ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere, and the film is ingeniously shot in fascinating sicilian landscapes. although not as gory as many other fulci films, this film is definitely gritty and uncompromising in its violence, with a few shockingly brutal scenes.<br /><br />"don't torture a duckling" has everything brilliant horror requires. this is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other fulci flicks, but i assure that searching it will pay off. any horror fan must see this personal favorite of mine, and i highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this. a masterpiece!
