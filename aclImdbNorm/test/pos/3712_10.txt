a beautifully photographed and paced short film. it evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after pearl harbor.<br /><br />i appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. great work by a great d.p., david boyd.<br /><br />though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. we understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. i understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does. i understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. the kid is tough, and the performance by jonathan furr is superb as is the veteran performance by ron perlman.
