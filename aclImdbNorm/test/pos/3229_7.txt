fuckland is an interesting film. i personally love the dogma movement. i wish it had lasted longer. it seems to have already died. many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. i don't know why. it's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the french new wave. besides fuckland, i've seen the first three in the series, festen, idioterne, and mifune. they were all great, festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. fuckland isn't up to those others. i was just fascinated with the filmmaking. it's played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down. at a few points in the film, it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction, but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time. i wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen. it is basically about this guy, fabian, who is an argentinian visiting the faulkland islands. argentinians were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands, and fabian plans to impregnate the women with argentinian children. he sets his eyes on one, and most of the movie is spent on her seduction. the two actors are very natural. camilla heany only kind of hints that she is an actress. fabian stratas seems completely real. the politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me, since i have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history. i was 3, i think, when the faulklands were invaded. the final bit of the film doesn't work at all. i don't get what the filmmakers were going for there. still, fuckland is an interesting dogma experiment. it does break some dogma rules, though, notably the no extra-diagetic music rule. there is a lot of that. 7/10.
