for one used to the comedies on television now- whether sketch, sitcom or animated, it's nice to watch something truly refreshing.<br /><br />the chaser has to be the best comedy of this decade, seinfeld being the last's triumph. it follows the hosts urban crusades to fix situations, do 'ad road tests' and try to get the facts from our politicians the good old fashioned way.<br /><br />despite being very controversial at times, the shows excellent quality, from the well made and truly funny opening credits to the sketch style investigations (sketch style only in time, they are not scripted, at least, not the ones at the other end of the joke) is certainly worth watching. even the most cynical and intellectual viewer won't be disappointed, and the show deserves ten stars.<br /><br />all in all, well done to the abc for showing this and i recommend it highly.
