this is an extremely involving series that is well casted and portraits a sensitive subject with great splendor. we follow michael ealy as the undercover fbi agent darwyn, set to infiltrate a terror cell lead by farik (oder fehr). the series is very well written, and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next.<br /><br />michael ealy is by my definition one of the best actors i've seen portraying an undercover agent. icey cold on the outside, but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional roller-coaster ride that fbi has had him embark on. oder fehr on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario. big and strong, but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed. highly authoritative and extremely cunning. the way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />the way the story develops, and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable, and also very true to life i would imagine. it is of such magnitude that you're left with the feeling of being insecure, not knowing what might happen next in real life. we read about terror every day, and here we are given a good sneak peak into an underworld which most of us know very little about.<br /><br />it's a series that will for sure have you coming back for more, sitting there at the edge of your seat just waiting for next weeks episode to come on. it's a sure winner in my eyes, and i have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best.
