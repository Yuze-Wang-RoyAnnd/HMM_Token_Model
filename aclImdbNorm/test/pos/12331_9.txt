you have got to see this movie... i saw it, as a 13 year old, at the theater, on my very first date... fast forward over 20 years and i'm now gay (thanks a lot one dark night!! lol!). this movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid (mausoleums still do!), but as an adult, the thrill of this movie isn't in the storyline, but rather the hysterical laughs it holds... highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) to "turkey". also, keep your eyes peeled for the scene where carol (the blond, head sister) attempts to hang her phone up on a soda can (can't believe they didn't reshoot that!)... other highlights include adam west's overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey corpses. if you're a fan of true horror, i'd suggest this film just because, to me, it's almost a parody on horror. there is def. a creepy factor and the plot is a good one, but don't watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits (unless you're like 10 years old or something).
