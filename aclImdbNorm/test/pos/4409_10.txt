just to correct something in a previous review here, i don't believe this film is only for people who know london, it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments. jack rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who, by going though this gruelling knowledge test, gain some measure of self-knowledge.<br /><br />i think it's one of the most perfectly-written dramas i've seen: technically it's supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it's also joyous in how it involves you. at the start you know no more about this london knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it's vitally important to you. you become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed for those who don't. especially one whose downfall, without giving anything anyway, will make your hands fly to your face.<br /><br />also just as a point of fact, nigel hawthorne's character, mr burgess, is called the vampire, not dracula. you don't need to know this, i'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen this, you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detail.<br /><br />i hope you get to see it.<br /><br />william
