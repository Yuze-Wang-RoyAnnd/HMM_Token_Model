sam lion (jean paul belmondo) discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death. when he discovers those he loved ans still loves are in need, he gets albert duvivier (richard anconina) to help them. in search of his own past, of his own desires, this fabulous film by claude lelouch is a man's quest for himself at a ripe age.<br /><br />built like all lelouch films, the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling, especially scenes where paul belmondo (who looks a huge lot like his father) is playing a young sam lion while sam lion stands in the same room - a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp.<br /><br />one of lelouch's most elaborate works, l'itineraire d'un infant gate is a must-see tale of self fulfilment.
