8 points for take on probably what really kinda maybe more what it was like back then. american indians probably stole more than killed. who really knows? nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and... interesting and unique. thankfully not another mindless shoot em up. i thought this would suck at first, i wound up getting wrapped up... nice treasure... good job! i have hopes nobody dissects this film. when the entire movie unfolds you have many unique twists, impossible to determine what will be next. the characters are human and have either honor or not... passion or not... forgiveness or not. wound up loving the white horse, the indian, sheen even the damned desert. all good.
