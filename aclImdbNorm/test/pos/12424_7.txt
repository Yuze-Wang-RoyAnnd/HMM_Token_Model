in the veins of jeepers creepers and the texas chainsaw massacre, monster man surprisingly well-made--though mindless--little horror. throw in a little buddy-comedy, nice gore and intense scare. it's hard no to say that monster man is really entertaining. the low budget seem pretty obvious, but it doesn't effected the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shame.<br /><br />yes, the plot somewhat generic as possible. pair of friend, adam (eric jungman)and harley (justin urich) are driving cross country to interrupt the wedding of a woman adam has always loved. while adam is more nerdy type, harley is a self-proclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth. adding a bonus to the plot, then they picked up a sexy hitchhiker, sarah (aimee brooks). things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them. when dead body starts counting, they must do the race against the time before their own life on risk.<br /><br />the plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies, but michael davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension. the scare is build well enough, where characterization is never be the best, but fairly okay. the script also littered with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale. it's hilarious and shocking in the same time, which is pretty amusing.<br /><br />as conclusion, monster man surprisingly entertaining. it deserves more attention in the big screen. it proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie, but skill does! something that the director has shown and delivers.
