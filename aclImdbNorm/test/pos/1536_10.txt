"closet land" tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements. you could read lots of stuff about the movie's plot before hand, but you don't really need to. all you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation. along the way, we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated. we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. especially when you have absolutely no control over it.<br /><br />in the end, the movie amounts to a warning (really though, the movie has several different aspects to it) about what happens to people's freedoms when they "look the other way" and ignore injustices happening to those around them.<br /><br />if you've got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this, i strongly recommend that you do so.
