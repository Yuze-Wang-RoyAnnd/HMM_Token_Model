six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. the one negative review happens to reside (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in the imdb.<br /><br />i found "what alice found" to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that i have seen this year. it's 6.4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie. who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing? guess again.<br /><br />for me, "alice" was a positively gripping psychological thriller. i was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time. it's a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast. in a fairer world, actress judith ivey would win awards for keeping you guessing whether she was good or evil.<br /><br />ignore the rating and see this terrific movie. (and by the way, i wish there was a soundtrack album.)
