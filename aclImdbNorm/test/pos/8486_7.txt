i saw ray when it first came out. why? partly, because of the advertising hype, secondly because i just loved the heck outa ray charles's music. but not being around when his biggest things in music and his life happened, i wanted to learn more about the man's life. and in this film, i did. his addiction to drugs was something i didn't know, and the film let us know.<br /><br />but here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical film...i cannot say it was a "great" film. i've seen "malcolm x" and was blown away. same with "what's love got to do with it" and "bird". the performances of each of those films was outstanding. i wasn't just drawn into the main characters in those films - who did incredible jobs - but to those around them as well. that helps make a picture to me.<br /><br />i felt that at some parts of this film was shallow and heavy handed for emotional appeal. and yes, i'll admit at certain parts of the film i almost fell asleep. and the film was too long. and the film left out several "other" important details of ray charles life that would have made the film flow better. the film got "choppy" to me in certain parts. and the film seemed to end with a whimper, not a bang - certain parts, including the ending played like a tacked on "lifetime" cable network movie to me. i expect more outa cinema.<br /><br />so -- where does my ambivalence come in? with jamie foxx's performance. overall, he did -- okay. not denzel washington's malcolm x or angela bassett's tina turner's spectacular, but...okay.<br /><br />sorry folks, but to me, there were several points in the film where i saw jamie foxx's interpretation of ray charles, and in others - thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting - he "looked" like ray charles. but i paid attention to the ... acting. an actor has to make you believe he is the character he is playing. not make a caricature of the character. did i believe jamie foxx was ray on the screen? sometimes yes -- sometimes no.<br /><br />did jamie foxx deserve a golden globe? you betcha. does he deserve an oscar...? depends on who's he's up against. he's got a few major competitors there, and he might just edge them out. but then again...maybe not. if jamie foxx doesn't win, i will not stand up and say "he was robbed". i wont particularly feel that he had been.<br /><br />this was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story. a "great" autobiographical film of the late ray charles? no. somewhere out there, i feel there is a great film about ray charles just waiting to be made, and an actor that will blow you completely away in doing so.
