i can't say that i embrace this as a romantic comedy, as i found little funny about it. i did find it endearing, entertaining, heartwarming, and terminally sweet, and while there were some witty moments, i found them more bittersweet than outright comedic.<br /><br />i liked this one. barrymore has grown so much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen, but this translates well to the small screen, too. in fact, on subsequent viewings, i like this one more and more.<br /><br />if you're a fan of the romantic comedy, then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one, but if you're in it for the romance, it's definitely here to be found.<br /><br />it rates a 7.8/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
