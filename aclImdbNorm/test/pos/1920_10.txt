filmmakers made a rather boring everyman's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. at the same time, we're exposed to a truly original, existential french loner. <br /><br />the film is more than a documentary. hardly ever do i feel that i've experienced something that's accidentally profound, which makes it all the more profound.<br /><br />film has visually interesting interior moments. absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (quite a lot of europeans in the credits). hopefully, pbs will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the usa.
