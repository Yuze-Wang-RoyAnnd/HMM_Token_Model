you know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. well, not this time. unconditional love has it all. barry manilow and a dwarf in a movie with cathy bates as the romantic lead...and it works. not only does it work, it works very very well. in fact, i think it's perfect. i laughed so hard i think i hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. but isn't that where great comedies come from? don't characters need real feelings, real emotions, and the ability to feel real pain? well, they do in this movie. unconditional love is a movie you shouldn't miss, especially if you need a seriously good laugh, or you're at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat.
