one cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film, and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunities.<br /><br />i found the script to be excellent, and the vocal talent of edmund purdom quite impressive. however, as an artifact of its time, the film suffers from too many hollywood-isms, especially poor casting, too much lushness of the sets, and too much pretentiousness. edmund purdom (who plays the title character) is so obviously awkward with physical acting, i suspect he had primarily been in shakespearean theater before this.<br /><br />so if movie people are reading this, i propose this as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you cast real egyptians as egyptians!
