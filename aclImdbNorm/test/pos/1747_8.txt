there was a time when not all animation was disney or pixar. its so nice to see this wonderful film again and i actually got hold of a good, reasonable copy on dvd. be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.i got a very good copy by a company called flashbacks and its quite good. in the old days i watched it on black and white on tv and its magic to see it in colour. very much better than some would have you believe. the songs are delightful and the colour is great. interestingly the characters are really well developed which is odd in animated movies. i loved hoppity and the villain mr beatle is a real cad. its incredibly imaginative. the way inanimate objects like cotton reels, old tins become part of the environment and have new functions is great. the anthropomorhic use of insects is amazing considering the much malinged creatures most people sadly think are repugnant. hopefully we may never step on an insect again! the insects enemy is man. in reality of course its the insects that will survive. no matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in australia they keep coming back. the battle has been lost and we have to live with them. there are several scenes that stand out such as when hoppity and mr bumble are caught in a watering can, the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful. its also rather anthropomorphic but in a way thats charming. the human characters look very like the ones in gulliver and its incredibly effective. the wedding scene looks beautiful. its a crime this movie has not been hailed as a classic. the only jarring note for me is the occasions in the film when the characters slip into verse. speaking verse spoils the narration and it was no needed, the verse is awful and spoils an other wise good script. its great and kids will love it. its a joy to look at. there's a very clever ending too.
