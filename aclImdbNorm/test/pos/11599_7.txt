i saw this movie at the locarno film festival in italian-speaking part of switzerland.<br /><br />aishwarya rai is good-looking.<br /><br />i rate this movie 7/10 because of its nice moments.<br /><br />* spoilers ahead *<br /><br />it has some really nice cinematic moments in it, specially at the end.<br /><br />though my general feeling is this is too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes) and containing too much dialogs. and nearly no dancing at all.<br /><br />clearly a bollywood movie like lagaan or devdas is quite a different kind of movie compared with chokher bali.
