the 1970's saw a rise and fall of what we have come to know as "blacksploitation" films. the term is a reference to kind of broad catch-all, rather than a true genre of film. in short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or urban cops & robbers shoot-em-up, that are so constructed and so cast as to appeal to the large urban black population of the mid 20th century. that indeed could embrace the widest type of films, as long as the had a slant toward the inner-city black population.<br /><br />it appears that the idea of producing these films of particularly keen interest to black americans had its genesis with the eastertime release of 100 rifles (marvin schwartz prod./20th century-fox, 1969). in it, former syracuse university all-american footballer and several times all-pro fullback for the cleveland browns, jim brown, had a co-starring billing. having appeared in a number of films already, as for example, rio conchos (1964),the dirty dozen (1967), (ice sttion zebra (1968)* and others, it was beginning to make more sense to the studios' "suits" that jim was a hot property.<br /><br />now this 100 rifles brings record numbers of black patrons to the big cities' central business districts on easter sunday to view mr. brown. why not start to film more of these adventure epics and other types of film with more black players and stars? why not, indeed.** so we saw a succession of cops & robbers, bad-ass private detective films, comedies, all going the route. along the way, we eventually got to some more family oriented, wider appealing films. the movie goers were treated to sounder (1972), the take (1974), conrack (1974)and, ultimately, claudine (1974).<br /><br />in claudine, we find no stigma nor easy classification as being "blackploitation", as the story is universal, and could easily have been done as a story about people of any descent, any where, and not just in the 1970's usa.<br /><br />that the story was done of a single mother, claudine (dianne carroll), struggling to keep a family together after "....two marriages and two almost marriages.", is a far cry from a shoot-em-up harlem style. the problems that plague the everyday citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the ol' sociological microscope.<br /><br />but we also consider claudine's psychological and physical needs as a female. for "woman needs man and man must have his mate",***and we do concede this point. (that's s-e-x that we're talking about, schultz!) claudine meets up with a very masculine, broad shouldered, athletic type in private scavanger garbage man, ruppert b. marshall (james earl jones) and they go on a date.<br /><br />the great welfare state intervenes with the couple as claudine's welfare case worker, miss tayback (elisa loti), comes snooping around to see just who is this unattached male, who is suddenly paying so much attention to claudine's family.<br /><br />after a humiliating experience with the welfare bureau's auditing and "deducting" binge, which would be the norm for the family, the two decide to get married with or without the blessing of big brother.<br /><br />meanwhile, claudine's elder son has gotten involved with some big talking but little doing black activist group. but, with ruppert's help, he and they all come through it a.o.k.<br /><br />it ends on a happy, upbeat and hopeful note. we know that it may not be exactly "...happily ever after!", but rather the'll make it all together! if there is a single criticism that we must state it is that sometimes in a movie like this, a misconception is spread to a large portion of urban blacks. and that is, the apparent implied myth that all whites are wealthy, having none of their kind ever in need of a helping hand, out of work or suffering any disabilities.<br /><br />well, folks, it just ain't true! note: * at one point, jim brown's career was a real hit as a rugged actioner. he was even being tauted as "...the black john wayne." note: ** the idea of producing films with all-black casts, filmed for all-black consumption was not a new idea. in the 1920's, '30's and '40's, we saw productions from people like noble johnson, spencer williams, jr. and rex ingram.<br /><br />note: *** that's "as time goes by", you know, schultz, it's from casablanca (warner brothers, 1942).
