when jurassic park first came out, it was revolutionary in filmaking and special effects.for the first ever time people cold go to a dinosaur movie and be convinced they were looking at real dinosaurs brought to life.however whilst some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the real creatures could have been like (t.rex,brachiosaurus,triceratops etc)some were altered to fit the movie(velociraptor,dilophosaurus)and the film took place n the present on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. walking with dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats all those millions of years ago. the amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great. now we can view sights such as a grim triassic desert,a whole herd of diplodocus, an icthyosaur give birth, a massive sea monster, a pterosaurs eye-view,dinosaurs thriving in the south pole, two torosaurus lock horns,t.rex roaring at the camera and the impact of the comet that spelled their doom. these dinosaurs walk,run,feed,fight,breed,hunt and swim. but the series also reveals the other creatures that they shared the world with,two episodes are mainly focused on two different kinds of animals, the flying pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived beneath the waves. the locations and scenery are spectacular and look all the more unique when a cg dino walks onto screen. and as for the cgi and animatronics, the movements of the cgi dinosaurs look totally and completely natural,the colouring is bright and vivid and the crewmen have taken careful steps to ensure that the cg animals interact with their environments in any way an actual creature would by making splashes in the water,brushing by bushes, kicking up dust and casting shadows on the ground. admittedly the cg isn't perfect with a few brief instances where the animals look too computery but the rest of the time it looks breathtaking. the puppetry is poor in some cases but it has its moments particularly the scene with the cynodonts in the first episode. the narration by kenneth branagh is pretty good as well giving us vital bits of information and drama at the same time. but of course the true pleasure is seeing a living dinosaur doing what they did all those years ago and also seeing some truly cute moments with cynodont(mammal/reptile hybrid)pups,sauropodlets(baby diplodocus)and t.rex chicks(yes even t.rex can be cute)and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and was even more so back then. all this adds up to a prehistoric nature masterpiece that lets you see a real dinosaur and take your breath away, all from the safety of your living room. if you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, amazing visuals or just to have a truly good viewing and be entertained then walking with dinosaurs is definitely for you. easily recommended.
