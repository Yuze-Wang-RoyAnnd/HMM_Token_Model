the ali g show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. sasha cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... and it is very funny. so i didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. so the basic point of all show was lost. but i was wrong - i laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films i ever saw. sure it was stupid, but who cares if you can't actually brake in to safe with a car battery, like someone said? it wasn't supposed to be a realistic documentary... and it isn't like the show, it goes in totally different way, but that doesn't mean it is bad. when i finished watching i was totally impressed, but now when some time passed i realized that it was not that special anyway, but it still deserves a nine - well at least for what it is supposed to be.
