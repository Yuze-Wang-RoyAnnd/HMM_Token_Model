"a tale of two sisters" is a brilliant south korean psychological horror that left me speechless.the film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy.the small cast of actors is truly excellent,with lead im soo-jung being especially memorable in the lead role.the direction by kim ji-woon is well-handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.the plot is slightly confusing,but some scenes are wonderfully eerie.the action is rather slow,but i was not bored in the slightest;i was extremely curious and intrigued.the house,where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated."a tale of two sisters" is along with "ringu" and "kairo" one of the most original asian horror films i have ever seen.watch this masterpiece as soon as possible.my rating:10 out of 10.
