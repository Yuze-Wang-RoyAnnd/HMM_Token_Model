the "house of dracula" really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or thrills or new twists on an already tired storyline. this film was made as a hasty sequel to the fairly better made "house of frankenstein" from a year earlier. in "house of dracula" you can see the factory like production values of 1945 taking their toll on an otherwise potentially scary movie. stock footage from previous films in the series and then the ending from "ghost of frankenstein" used as the ending here just makes for an "el cheepo" flick. therein lies the shame of the studio and the producer considering that they had top notch talent and merely wasted everybody's time and effort on a quick money return scheme. but that seems to have been the trend all throughout hollywood at the end of wwii. this is what brought on some of those mindless scifi pics of the 1950's with all their closeups of harmless lizards in order to make them appear as dinosaurs. the days of james whale and val lewton, to mention two, were over as far as creating real mood and atmosphere in this genre. keep in mind also that the makeup genius, jack pierce, who actually did medical research in order to create all of our favorites, was summarily fired right after this particular film was released. a lesser capable makeup man by the name of bud westmore was then hired as the head of this department at universal, soon to be universal-international. not to denigrate mr. westmore's ability but horror films were just not his forte. ok, to watch or not to watch. watch this film but only as part of the chronological order of the frankenstein series and you'll see how this all ended up as comic fodder for abbott & costello.
