that this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. the commercial suicide the monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. to destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome american alternative to the beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality. the monkees' television series was not that conventional, but head is utterly plotless...although in the end there is actually some kind of circular logic to it all. unrestrained by a genuine storyline, the surreal sequence of events is by turns hilarious and rather disturbing. the greatest irony is that the monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak. their exploration into psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack to head (all the songs are memorably woven into the film), which is one of the landmarks albums of the 'sixties. the monkees began to disintegrate after the box office failure of this movie, but head serves as a noble legacy.
