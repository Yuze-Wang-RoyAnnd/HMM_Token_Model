fame, i think, was the best movie that i have ever seen. in ways it was funny and dramatic, but that is what makes a movie. true, it has a few loose ends, actually a lot, but i still think that it is a terrific movie. some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie. i think it is hilarious when the girl tries to act out o.j. simpson in "the towering inferno" and raul/ralph goes around to every art department saying that his father was great at every one. he says that his dad danced with the rockets and left ralph his tap shoes. the rockets, as far as i know, are made up of women. and the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. also the guy who read the lines of juliet in the romeo and juliet play was funny. one thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music. i have never heard anything like it!!! my favorite song is "i sing the body electric" and my second is the theme song itself "fame". irene cara has a great voice and is a great actress. i like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups. it showed all of the kinds of people there actually are in what is now called "la guardia school of the performing arts". this movie showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, including angelo, doris, bruno, coco, montgomery, ralph, leroy, hilary, and liza. they all had a hard time, but made it their own way. this movie could have added on about another 30-45 minutes (before the graduation), but it is still my favorite movie no matter what!!!!
