ah, classic comedy. at the point in the movie where brains get messed together, a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially, reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie.<br /><br />for years and years, bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him. we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep. we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies, and we want to see 'man with the screaming brain'. with the title alone, one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie, like army of darkness, only with more silly and less monsters.<br /><br />the idea of the movie is simple. bruce sees doctor. doctor has new idea. bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor. coincidentally, it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him. hilarity ensues.<br /><br />with the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy, and journeyman stacy keach as dr. ivan ivanovich ivanov, it's funny, that does this movie. complete funny. never a point of scary.<br /><br />if you like the silly bruce campbell, you'll like this. then again, why would you be watching this if you didn't like bruce campbell?
