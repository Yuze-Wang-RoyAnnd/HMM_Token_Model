this is an excellent movie that tackles the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way. great performances all round but absolutely outstanding acting by sidney poitier.<br /><br />he makes this movie breathe and alive. his portrayal of a guy who struggles against discrimination and violence is simply mind blowing. his acting is forceful and delicate and subtle at the same time. truly worthy of an oscar, poitier had to wait (because of his skin colour) for many more years before the sheer brilliance of his acting was recognised by the academy.<br /><br />cassavetes turns in a great performance too, withdrawn, troubled and realistic as it has become his hallmark. he and poitier contrast inimitably the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship.<br /><br />the movie is enjoyable and at the same time deeply haunting in its portrayal of racism in the us. the irony is that it somehow mirrors the realities under which poitier had to work.
