saw this at sundance one of the first years i attended the festival - blew me away...<br /><br />it went by much too fast, and i've never been able to find it again. i figured it would show up on a compilation somewhere, but still no joy. my memory's foggy on the details - i just remember being surprised over and over again, and on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />anyone reading this have any leads? online, dvd, beat-up vhs copy - i'd try to make it worth your while...<br /><br />over the years, i've probably seen over 200 short films (used to live near aspen where they have an incredible shorts fest in april). this definitely ranks among my favorites, and i hope to see it again!<br /><br />many thanks to anyone with leads on how to see it :)
