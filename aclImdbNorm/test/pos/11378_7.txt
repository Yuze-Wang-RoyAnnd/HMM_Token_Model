an interesting companion piece to true documentaries of john c. holmes. unfortunately, it doesn't deal with what ultimately killed holmes, and it certainly could have benefited from doing so. burt reynolds and mark wahlberg got the most praise for this, but i felt the true stars were julianne moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother wannabe, don cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstar/stereo-salesman in some wild getups and william h. macy, who's wife is the ultimate slut. not to mention a nearly unrecognizable alfred molina. macy's new year's eve bash and cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shot. what this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. however, none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all rebound and return to their normal lives.
