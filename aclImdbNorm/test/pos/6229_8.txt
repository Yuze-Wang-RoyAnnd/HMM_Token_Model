a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond, where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies, and the only form of help is affable local mr. slausen (chuck connors). as night falls, the kids get picked off in record time.<br /><br />an odd, freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of all-too-lifelike mannequins (making this a good update of the "bodies in the wax museum" genre), this is an intense shock fest along the lines of "the texas chain saw massacre". (it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a. burns repeats that duty here, and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy.) pino donaggios' score is downright chilling; accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg, it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphere.<br /><br />plot twists vary in level of success; there was one that i saw coming a mile away, and one that actually took me by surprise, and i was all the more happier for it. one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front, as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition. the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the end.<br /><br />star connors offers an engaging performance as our down-home good ol' boy antagonist, while the younger co-stars, predictably, can't perform at the same level, although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damsel-in-distress. co-star tanya roberts (a brunette in this film) is okay in support. (if i had one problem with this film, it's just that the victims are a little too stupid. then again, that doesn't make this much different from many horror films of the 80's.) future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou, who was the editor here, ron underwood (who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with "tremors") as the assistant director, and veteran makeup artist ve neill, who's done many films and won three oscars since.<br /><br />although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto. recommended.<br /><br />8/10
