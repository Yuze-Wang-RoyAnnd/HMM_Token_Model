what attracts a man to military service? what prepares a man to survive brutal torture as a prisoner of war? what desperation leads to the planning and execution of an escape into the jungles of southeast asia? how does he cope with the ghosts and memories he returns home with? herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary of dieter dengler, german emigre and u.s. navy pilot shot down over laos in 1966, who was taken prisoner, tortured and starved, but ultimately escaped to be haunted by the experience for the rest of his life. a powerful and personal first-hand account of the man, his life and experience recounted through the seemless integration of interviews, archival footage and new footage. you will never forget this story--or this man.
