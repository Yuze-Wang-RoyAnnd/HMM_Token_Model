obsessed!!!!! i have every season of gilmore girls and i think the reason i love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. and its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. i think gilmore girls is one of the bests shows on t.v. shows of its time. its fun because they talk so fast you can't get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes. also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is.<br /><br />and you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty lorelai to the hermit luke to the immature kirk the show is just amazing. i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them. there is only one word that can describe gilmore girls....classic!!!!!!
