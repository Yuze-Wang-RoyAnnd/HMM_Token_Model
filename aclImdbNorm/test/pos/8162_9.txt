i was impressed by the story. it had the "typical" predatory gay male and the "typical" mormon missionary. but, they each also had friends and family who balanced their lives well. there are a number of characters, some nice and some not so nice, each with their own personality nuances. and, most reminded me of people in my own life.<br /><br />the story starts out with several humorous moments and slowly evolves into a heartwarming relationship film. the story progresses without obvious plot turns and never talks down to you. it makes you think a bit while waiting to see what happens. even when i thought i could foresee something coming, i was surprised by how it actually came about.<br /><br />not many movies make me laugh knowingly at real gay dialogue and then bring a tear to my eye when i feel the characters' pain. i watched the film on dvd, and couldn't bring myself to stop watching until it was over. (usually, i watch a film in pieces over a couple of days.) it's nice to see a film with gay characters that is uplifting, but not preachy. i highly recommend this film! and, not just for gay audiences. the relationships transcend sexuality.
