i cannot hate on the show. when the old (and better) tech tv had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in. "attack of the show" is the replacement for the screen savers, with 3 co-hosts in the beginning. they were kevin rose, kevin pereira and sarah lane. brendan moran came to be something of a co-host as well, but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show. kevin rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host, but that didn't pan out for some reason.<br /><br />eventually (i just learned this from this very imdb messageboard) sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because (hey, this is what i read) the two got married. that was a big secret to me! now there is a new female co-host, the not-as-hot (my opinion) olivia munn. she's hiding something in those tops she wears, while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it.<br /><br />ahem! sorry.<br /><br />"attack of the show" deals with everything young people want to know about. it's music, movies, comic books, the internet and television. this is what's great about the show. if you don't want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv, you can get all you want on aots. some segments and bits they do are funny. they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry, as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names.<br /><br />even though the hosts aren't as geek as i'd like them to be, i still have found "attack of the show" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.
