helen (kate capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of loblolly by the sea. divorced, helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. working at helen's store are the manager, janet (ellen degeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, george (tom selleck), and two young college students, jennifer (julianne nicholson) and johnny (tom everett scott). one day, helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that johnny has written it for her. throwing caution to the wind, helen and johnny begin a small-time "thing". but, the letter subsequently lands in others' hands, including janet's, who thinks george has sent it to her, and johnny's, who imagines helen has penned it for him. and, on and on the letter goes. but, in truth, george possibly has eyes for helen and jennifer has fallen hard for johnny. the town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love. will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? this is a cute movie with a gorgeous setting and capable stars. each of the main actors gives a pleasing performance, including the addition of blythe danner and gloria stuart to those mentioned previously. then, too, the coastal scenery is most lovely, the costumes quite well-chosen, and the photography very nice indeed. there are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development, which may not please all viewers. but, for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be included on any list of good choices for the genre.
