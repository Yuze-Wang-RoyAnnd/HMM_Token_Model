"porgy and bess" is an outstanding production of george gershwin's masterpiece. it is tastefully done in muted colors. the voices are outstanding. although sidney portier's voice is dubbed for his singing portion, he gives a very touching performance. there is a remarkable performance by sammy davis jr. as sportin life. there is yet no dvd available for viewing, and this piece begs for one. all intelligent movie goers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium. the screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals including the outstanding ones by rodgers and hammerstein. be sure to ask for it an your video supplier. like "songs of the south" by walt disney, it may be the assumption of racial overtones that is preventing the marketing of this cinema.
