ingrid bergman (cleo dulaine) has never been so beautiful. gary cooper as "cleent" so perfectly cast as a laconic texan who knows this gal is up to no good. when the two lock eyes at the french market, we know this match will be full of sparks. when they stroll in her garden in her restored french quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics.<br /><br />the costumes are lovely; the set decoration makes you wish the "quarter" was just that way. and that saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping.<br /><br />from edna ferbers novel, the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry.<br /><br />in the saratoga scenes, florence bates as a grand dame steals every scene.<br /><br />but it is the scene of cleo taking on the little lawyer her new orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a magic movie moment. after cleo has bested him in the negotiations, he looks at her with longing and says "may i say - you are very-beautiful". and cleo with a happy, wicked smile says "yes, isn't it lucky." you want to shout "yes"!!!<br /><br />one of my all time favorite romantic films.
