"the china syndrome" launched a whole string of films about the potentially devastating effects of misused nuclear power, a black cloud of paranoia that would hang over america for much of the reagan years. it's a well-made and effective drama, given an extra punch by its high-power stars, notably jack lemmon who plays a senior official of the nuclear power plant who suffers a crisis of conscience. but one can't help but think that it was the serendipitous timing of the three mile island nuclear accident that occurred just a couple of weeks after this film's release that has given it its lasting appeal as a classic from the 70s. as watchable as it is, it's certainly no classic.<br /><br />with a red-headed jane fonda as a news reporter and a bearded michael douglas as her camera man (and the film's producer, by the way).<br /><br />grade: b+
