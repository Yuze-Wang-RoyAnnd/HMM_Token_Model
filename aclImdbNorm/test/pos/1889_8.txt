these are the kinds of movies i loved, and still love growing up. unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them. this movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />there was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't a list material. but that is not the point. the point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge cgi clich'e' filled movies. there are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you, and not get as much money as they can.<br /><br />besides, its also nice to know that good ol' bruce isn't dead yet.
