i really liked this movie. one thing i have noticed is that korean tv drama's are way better, as far as giving you the whole story. i watch movies when i do not have the time or feel like going through 16-30 episodes. movies are seem to be rushed and if you do not watch carefully, you may miss something. <br /><br />i do feel this one was rushed and i had to rewind a few parts to try and find what i missed, especially towards at the end. if you like nice love stories, i still think this is cute, and if yo have the extra time, i still think this is worth watching.<br /><br />it is always nice to go back follow the actors in different movies as we do not get to follow them from when they begin, as we do the actors producers and directors in our own countries.
