the lovely, yet lethal alexandra (stunning statuesque blonde beauty stacie randall, who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master faust can cross over into our dimension. it's up to fearless, rugged cop jonathan graves (likable peter liapis) to stop her. meanwhile, two pitifully unfunny "comic relief" dwarf gnome creatures run amok in los angeles. seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert jim wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously. the cast struggle gamely with the silly material: the adorable barbara alyn woods as sassy, fetching police captain kate, raquel krelle as tart, sexy hooker jeanine, bobby di cicco as graves' bumbling, excitable partner scotty, peggy trentini as alluring museum curator monica, and ace mask as the jolly dr. rochelle. mark stevi's puerile cookie cutter script, an amusingly lowbrow sense of no-brainer humor, chuck cirino's bouncy cornball score, the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber halloween masks, j.e. bash's plain cinematography, no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of, and the tacky (less than) special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid velveeta. an entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck.
