discovering something, the journey is so much more fun, so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination. falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. you feel energized, invigorated and alive. you simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes aroused. love, and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it, is pure bliss. where it goes from here is anyone's guess, but when you first begin your journey together, nothing can compare to it.<br /><br />diane lane and richard gere play adrienne willis and dr. paul flanner, two emotionally scarred middle aged individuals. in this film, they are about to embark on that mystical journey together, where love, and the discovery of the emotions along the way, will help save them.<br /><br />lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him. as hurt as she was by him, as much as she really dislikes him, there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back. why you might ask? because in life, and love, sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence. yes, this man cheated on her but she has kids with him, she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him.<br /><br />richard gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father. he also just lost a patient as she reacted negatively to the anesthetic. he is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue. this is what brings him to rodanthe in the first place. although his lawyer told him not to, he felt compelled to visit the woman's husband in rodanthe. he stays at the inn that adrienne is taking care of. soon, they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life.<br /><br />by now this sounds like a simple idea for a film, and although it might be something you've seen or read about before, gere and lane simply own the film. diane lane lights the screen up with her smile. her eyes twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching. gere's character is a little different. he is more hardened and bitter. it takes adrienne's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell. he blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient. on the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault, and that she was a 1 in 50,000 casualty. but deep down, it eats away at him. they find each other at a time when both need someone to listen.<br /><br />gere and lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers. they were married in unfaithful but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them. they have a spark and a real chemistry. i would love to see more films with them together. in fact, i'd love to see more films with diane lane but that's a story for another time.<br /><br />nights in rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. they both become better people, they both become stronger people. i enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. this is a film about redemption, absolution, and second chances.<br /><br />it will also ask you to bring some hankies.<br /><br />8/10
