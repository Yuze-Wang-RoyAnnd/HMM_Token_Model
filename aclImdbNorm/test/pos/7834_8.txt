forget everything that you have ever read about the mallachi brothers' straight-to-video release "snakes on a train," especially if it was a negative review. this movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off: "snakes on a plane." frankly, i am surprised that more people aren't rhapsodizing about this low-budget asylum release. instead, most reviews that i've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy, such as the acting was amateurish, the action didn't numerically live up to the advertising, and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time. of course, it doesn't help that the title is a tip-off to the obvious rip-off nature of this film. actually, i felt that "snakes on a train" surpassed "snakes on a plane" for a number of reasons.<br /><br />first, the producers used real, genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super-giant snake that consumed an entire amtrak like train. how many movies have a snake gobble a train? as a result, "snakes on a train" ranks as the first movie to scale that height.<br /><br />second, this low-budget movie employs some grisly gross-out effects. the woman who coughs up baby snakes--real ones--was fantastic! the special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing! also, you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake. she was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years old or thereabouts, and she died screaming all the way as nasty ol'e giant mister snake head swallows her. not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten! this is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won't find in 99 % of all theatrical hollywood releases. of course, she wasn't eaten by a real snake, but it's the subversive thought that counts.<br /><br />third, it is one of those cursed upon movies where alma (julia ruiz of "that guy"), the chief female character--no heroine--has a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn't marry the man that they recommended. as a result, she is filled with snakes, coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake. imagine medusa, the mythical characters that had snakes for hair, only with the snakes in her belly. her psycho-shaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to l.a. on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal. talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines. prepare yourself for lots of slime, blood, and gore. <br /><br />fourth, the train had only about twenty or so passengers, not hundreds. nevertheless, it looked like the mallachi brothers filmed this above-average horror flick on-board a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks.<br /><br />fifth, the snakes slither around for the first hour, quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody. in other words, it's suspense, suspense, suspense, before people start dying from snake bites.<br /><br />up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it, "snakes on a train" is warped, wonderful, and way-out. it doesn't have the attention deficit editing of a big league hollywood movie. it's a fantasy about an unfortunate hispanic women victimized because of her feminist, at-odds-with-society attitude. <br /><br />altogether, you've got gory fantasy type stuff; suspenseful snakes slithering around the train, and am over-the-top gigantic snake at the end. incidentally, they get on board the train because a bunch of other mexicans have bribed a train employee and the mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free.<br /><br />i think it's better than "snakes on a plane" if you want a tough, little, independently produced horror movie.
