i grew up in new york city and every afternoon abc would show the 4:30 movie- saratoga trunk was one of the first movies i remember watching as a kid. i loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years. i recently watched it again and still thought it was great - maybe i am just a romantic - but i thought it was well done. i do not want to say this movie was good only because of the main actors - i really did not know who they were when i first saw this movie - i guess i just knew quality acting as a child. both bergman and cooper were excellent. i especially loved seeing old new orleans during the time period of this movie . if you ever get a chance to visit new orleans - you should watch movies that show the city during that time period - when you get to see some of the old homes in the french quarter(not just bourbon street) or uptown, you can truly imagine life as it was 100 years ago. <br /><br />i love old movies - this one to me is a good flick!!
