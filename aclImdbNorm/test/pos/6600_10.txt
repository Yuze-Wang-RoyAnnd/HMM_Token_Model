actually, i have more a question, than a comment. i loved z-boys, and the lords of dogtown. saw lords first, then the doc, and while i loved the story, i am curious as to why in the movie, sid was an important character, but in the documentary, he wasn't part of the team, and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew. does anyone know the story on that? the story of these boys was amazing. i never experienced the skateboarding craze where i grew up, but my kids have enjoyed it. what i have seen in local skate parks is what these boys had invented. i never knew that. when the film showed the competition, and z-boys did their thing, they put to shame the others in competition.
