clayton moore made his last official appearance on screen as the masked man in director lesley selander's epic adventure "the lone ranger and the lost city of gold," co-starring jay silverheels as his faithful indian scout tonto. selander was an old hand at helming westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit. this fast-paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of native americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since 1950 in hollywood oaters after director delmar daves blazed the trail with the james stewart western "broken arrow." racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the robert schaefer and eric freiwald screenplay. having written 13 episodes of "the lone ranger" television series, schaefer and freiwald each were thoroughly familiar with the formula, but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing. our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason. the mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don't have to guess what is happening.<br /><br />although the violence in this selander saga appears tame by contemporary standards, the fact that the lone ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a dastardly dame slays a double-crossing accomplice by hurling a tomahawk that sinks into his back between his shoulder blades was pretty audacious. the television series never went to this length, and when the lone ranger wielded his six-gun, he shot the gun out of the villain's fist rather than blow him away. the other discrepancy here is the indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information, but they are never brought up on charges from abducting this henchman. douglas kennedy didn't have the villainous statue of lyle bettger who menaced the masked man in director stuart heisler's "the lone ranger," but he acquits himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a qualm when the miscreant threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful indians.<br /><br />"the lone ranger and the lost city of gold" opens with a recap of the masked protagonist's origins as an ambushed texas ranger and his transformation into the lone ranger with tonto serving as his sidekick. this opening two minute refresher is an excellent way to get a series-oriented character off to a start so that everybody, including non-lone ranger fans, is on equal footing. the primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing hoods and called
