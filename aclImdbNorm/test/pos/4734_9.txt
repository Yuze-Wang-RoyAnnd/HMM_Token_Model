i watched a made for television film about the destruction at waco, texas. it was obviously heavily slanted toward the claim that david koresh was a murderous, child raping cult leader hell-bent on killing as many cops as he wanted and taking his people to the heavens on a blood stained stairway.<br /><br />the film was little more than propaganda further detailing what we had already read in the newspapers. i am more and more sure of that since i watched the great documentary waco: the rules of engagment. not that every assertion made in this film should be taken as god's truth, but it tells the whole story rather than regurgitating only what law enforcement decided to tell.<br /><br />for those who have forgot, koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement named the branch davidians. charges of drug use, kidnapping, illegal weapon ownership, and statutory rape (among others i'm sure) raised the suspicions of the local police, then later federal law enforcement. while attempting to serve a search warrant, the atf (bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms) and the clan participated in a shoot out that left deceased and wounded on both sides.<br /><br />it was then that the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) got involved. communications between the two were spirited but eventually broke down. the fbi prepared for an invasion by assaulting the building with flash-bang grenades and gas. when the building burnt to the ground killing many within, including koresh, the fbi refused to admit responsibility saying the "cult" inside must have set it on fire themselves. this hearkened images of jim jones and other violent religious organizations.<br /><br />the picture puts on many masks to tell its story. it begins with a sampling of the congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth," as far as the record is concerned anyway. what is eye-opening is how partisan the politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation as this. the democrats were concerned in nothing more than defending every single action taken by law enforcement. it was the republicans that seemed open to the other side.<br /><br />it is impossible to relate all of the new information and analysis provided by this documentary. additionally, a list would take away from the film opening up as it goes along. one example would be the heart-breaking fact that children died within the compound. the filmmakers probably side more with the davidians in general but stay relatively open to either side. in this instance the feds seem at fault for mishandling a situation that involves innocent children. but on the other hand the parents also need to shoulder some of the blame for leaving their kids in this harmful situation when they could have released them to any number of local authorities.<br /><br />probably the most damning new information comes late in the film and involves the fbi's claim they did not fire upon the building. this is left up to interpretation, and i will not reveal any more than to say it is disturbing and shocking what can and cannot be told.<br /><br />the federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than koresh. the largest condemnation seems to be leveled on the media, unwilling to tell both sides of a story. this element seems prevalent in recent documentaries, duly so i believe. it is time for the media to return to telling news stories and leave this relentless pursuit of what will draw the biggest audience and ratings.<br /><br />it is hard to mess up a documentary. in most cases switching on a camera and editing together interesting pieces of life is common and tells a terrific story. what few can do is shed such new light on a subject that the way you think about it is forever altered. waco is that kind of film. ***.5 out of ****
