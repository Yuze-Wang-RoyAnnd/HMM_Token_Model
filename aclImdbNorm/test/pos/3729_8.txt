i thought besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; capture true human emotions. the main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. the film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical sci-fi labeling and become a true drama. however calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. true this type of movie has been done been before but i think this one captures the joys and sorrows of that type of world possibly better than any other one does.
