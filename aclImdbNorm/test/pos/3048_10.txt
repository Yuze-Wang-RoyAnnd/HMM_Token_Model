all i can say is that each time i see conrack, dir. martin ritt, dp. john alonzo, i feel an utmost sense of inspiration and enlightment in what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple film.<br /><br />the motion picture conrack is set in 1969. it is based on a true story. it is a story about a white man (jon voight) who teaches a group of young black children how incredible the world is outside of their little south carolina island.<br /><br />the story places the job of a teacher as noble cause in changing children's lives.<br /><br />i highly recommend it.
