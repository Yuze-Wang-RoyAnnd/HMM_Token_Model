if you've got a box of tissues, a comfy couch, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a friday night, this is definitely your movie! its romantic, its hot and its challenging. for most of us gay people, religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and probably just starred at the alter boy and how cute he was! but in latter days, you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world revolves around belief's which totally contradict being gay. the two main cast members were totally hot, but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make me 'almost' cry (i have never cried in a movie!), which i thought was quite impressive for a b grade movie. i highly recommend this flick, you will laugh, you will cry (unless your me) and you will definitely drool! i love it so much i even purchased the dvd for my collection. its truly the most beautiful movie ever
