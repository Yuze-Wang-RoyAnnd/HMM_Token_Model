i absolutely fell in love with "living in a big way" when i first saw it! reason #1 is because i love, adore, and am a huge fan of gene kelly. he was such a wonderful dancer, actor, and choreographer. not to mention his extremely handsome looks and his sensual personality. i love his role in this movie. he was such a gentleman. this movie showcased his wonderful talent for acting. i enjoyed marie macdonald as well. it was my first time of ever seeing or knowing anything about her, and this excellent movie made me a fan of her's as well. actually, the whole cast in this movie was enjoyable and great. the humor between the butler,"everette hanover smythe", and the father, mr. morgan; mrs. morgan's courtroom humor, and especially grandmother morgan's immediate attachment to, and concern for "leo gogarty." and gene's number "fido and me" is adorable. the opening dance number with gene and marie is very nice too. i would recommend that anyone see this movie. it will truly remain dear to your heart forever. or at least it has to mine. and you'll fall in love with gene all over again. i rate it my #2 favorite gene kelly movie, and i've seen and own a quite many of his movies. they're a part of my daily routine! so trust me when i tell you, you'll love this movie! watch it and enjoy!!
