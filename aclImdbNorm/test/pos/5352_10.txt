having just come home from my third viewing of the curse of the were-rabbit, i decided to jump on imdb and see what others thought. i noticed a lot of brits loved it, while those in america just didn't get it. that really doesn't come as any shock, as america doesn't get what "english" is.<br /><br />wallace and gromit are very english. middle class english, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. the film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. it has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost, yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. there's some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes, drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. when people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world's messed up...<br /><br />one quick note to those (all american so far that i have seen) who think chicken run is a better film: chicken run was made to pander to your sense of humour, and i think it suffered because of it. curse of the were rabbit is witty, english, and intelligent. thomas the tank engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the americans and i'm glad nick park did not let that happen to another great british institution.<br /><br />to sum up: you can keep your chicken runs, your shreks, your madagasga's - that kind of crude, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is wallace and gromit in curse of the were-rabbit. english to the core, and long may wallace and gromit stay that way.
