even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group, i really enjoyed this movie. it's a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star. i know it was mine, to be sure! the first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy. once you get over that, you can really start to enjoy it. i loved the relationship between jd and jane - it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other. the soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well. i also liked the family set up for jane, her sisters seemed lovely. very well made film.
