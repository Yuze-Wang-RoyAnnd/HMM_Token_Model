i love ernest goes to jail. it's one of my top 3 favorite ernest movies. the others being ernest scared stupid and ernest goes to camp. in this movie ernest (jim varney) works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk. soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer felix nash (varney also) knocks him out and switches places with him! soon ernest is in jail and is forced to act like nash or else nash will kill charlotte ernest's love interest. when they take ernest to the electric chair thinking he's nash he gets so electrocuted he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves charlotte from the evil nash! filled with hilarious scenes and comics ernest goes to jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard! it still does to me! jim varney was such a fantastic actor! he did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy! varney was like his toy story co star tom hanks. no matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that varney's gonna be remembered forever for! r.i.p. jim varney 1949-2000. thank you for bringing ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
