this movie has to be seen for the music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by sergei prokofiev. obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. the cantata can be appreciated for itself, but having seen the movie helps.<br /><br />the story itself is fairly standard soviet wartime anti-german propaganda. an amusing anecdote is that stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing hitler at the onset of world war ii that eisenstein was seconded to a german movie for a short while, as penance.<br /><br />prince alexander nevsky (revered as a saint by the russian orthodox), having earned his nickname by defeating swedish raiders on the river neva, musters russian resistance against an invasion by the teutonic knights, and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would-be invaders.<br /><br />an interesting scene: alexander sees a convoy of russians being taken as slaves by mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop this, as the teutonic knights are his priority. the historical alexander nevsky paid tribute to the mongol khans, as his father before him, while working to consolidate his realm's future independence.
