the commenter before me stated this movie is the worst that was ever forced upon him/her as a child. i have to say though that i loved this movie when was little and i still love it today. the movie has the best running theme of all-family togetherness. considering the time period the movie was released i thought the movie was acted out well. i only wish i could still find a copy of it somewhere!! of all the 1980's films i watched as a kid this was on of my favorites. i know i probably watched it at least once a week with my brother and my mom. i would definitely recommend it to anyone i know-or don't know. so if you do find a copy of it i suggest watching it! it's wonderful and heartwarming.
