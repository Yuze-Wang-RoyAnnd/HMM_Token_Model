this movie was much better than i expected. ++++ jean peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights. (to the extent she may have a double doing the action, it's hard to tell...but peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it, and doing it well.) ++++ with a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. but it's basically cheesy. still entertaining however. ++++ not up to a regular jacques tournier film, but definitely above a regular jean peters film. color is typical of this '50s time period, ie. too garish and not realistic. the actors for blackbeard and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good. louis jordan was a bit weak. i don't think debra paget was right either. but certainly jean peters and debra paget were probably the two best looking female stars in the '50s.
