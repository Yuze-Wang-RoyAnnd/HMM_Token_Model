double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.<br /><br />it has all the elements we like in the columbo episodes. we get the laugh when columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in double shock. i can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.<br /><br />we also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles columbo. the end is the usual, we get the story about how columbo solved the mystery.<br /><br />this is another good columbo-episode, and i will rate it 7/10. it is close to 8/10.<br /><br />"just one more question" - the acting? peter falk is very good as usual.
