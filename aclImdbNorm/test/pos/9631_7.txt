it seems that all people didn't like steven seagal: just take a look at his nomination list, there are only razzie awards nominations (with one win) for him, but i think he didn't earn anything of it. i saw good movies with steven seagal, i saw bad movies with steven seagal. and the patriot (1998) is one of his best movies, nearly as good as under siege (1992) or hard to kill (1990). the patriot shows his activities to protect nature. surely, this movie is not a great one, and i must say that there is more violence than i like, and why must seagal's best friend l. q. jones die the death of a victim? the role of dr. mcclaren is one of seagal's best performances. he has, as always, a very good charisma. and in summary, the patriot is good entertainment-and with an average rating of only 4 points the most underrated movie of all time.<br /><br />regards, hans-dieter
