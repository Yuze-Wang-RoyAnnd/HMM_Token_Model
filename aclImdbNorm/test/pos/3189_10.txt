love in limbo is my all-time favoirite movie. (set in w.a) it is hilairious and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors, russell crowe (as arthur), back in the day when he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair. aden young (barry mcjannet), and craig adams as ken riddle.<br /><br />ken is a senior high school student obsessed with sex and becomes expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. he starts a new job at his uncles clothing factory and becomes close with another new guy barry mcjannet, who buys a car so that they can go out and pick up chicks. they become mates with the goody-twoshoes geek arthur baskin (crowe) and the three guys drive up to kalgoorlie to vsit a brothel and lose their virginity......<br /><br />watch it, its a classic!! for so long i have been trying to get a hold of a dvd or soundtrack, anyone let me know if you've got em.
