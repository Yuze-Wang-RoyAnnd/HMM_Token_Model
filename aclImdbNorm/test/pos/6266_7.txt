gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality...and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama....but i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years. immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss (who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma...hopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminess)....and charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer. radiant location photography (including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall) and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact. in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life...and making magic in the dark.
