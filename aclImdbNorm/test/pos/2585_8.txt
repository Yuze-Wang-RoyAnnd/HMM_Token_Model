me and my roommate got free tickets for a pre screening i guess you would call it in atlanta, ga at atlantic station. walking in i was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. but the film is much more than that. it's a story of two people helping each other. it's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.<br /><br />it's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. thats the beauty of it. if it tried to take itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, but instead it carries itself through humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good acting by ricci. although timberlake fails miserably in his role, the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend this movie, if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience.
