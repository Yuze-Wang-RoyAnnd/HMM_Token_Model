this movie is not for those expecting a martial-arts extravaganza. as for historical accuracy, i will leave that issue to those better informed on that subject. i thought the performances were wonderful. gong li never disappoints as the resourceful and (initially) loyal consort of the king of qin. fengyi zhang showed a lot of flexibility portraying a ruler descending into madness. he chose the "hannibal lector" route, rather than resorting to ranting. for me, the best performance was from zhiwen wang as the supersmooth marquis. the character came across as very oily, but in a subtle "sir humphrey appleby" - yes minister kind of way.<br /><br />the cinematography is the standout feature of this film. the scene when the marquis and his men stormed the palace was breathtaking. there are also a number of wonderful battle scenes. therefore, this film is highly recommended on the big screen.
