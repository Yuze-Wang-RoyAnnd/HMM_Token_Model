i have always loved brenda blethyn and "undertaking betty" was no disappointment. i saw it on satellite on dreary sunday morning. life has been stressful and this movie made me laugh and see things we usually consider dire in a mirthful way. i wish she would make more movies like this and "saving grace." brenda blethyn is a great gal for us approaching 60 to see in action. she is cute, beautiful and full of life without appearing plastic and phony. not many actresses are out there for us to relate to in a realistic, yet comical and/or serious way. brenda - if you see this - keep going with gems like this. we need more mrs. bennetts, bettys and graces.
