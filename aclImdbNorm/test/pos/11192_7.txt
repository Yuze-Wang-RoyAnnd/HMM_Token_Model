so, i won't disagree with the critics but i really was not all that moved by this movie. i was a little hesitant to rent it,as i am going through some of the same things the protagonist is supposed to be experiencing. yet, i did rent it thinking that i might experience some catharsis, or at the least understand that i am not alone. while i understood the protagonist's irritation with his careless cousin, i didn't feel his internal struggle with isolation as much as i would have liked. i felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin overstaying his welcome. it is a beautifully filmed movie, and i did really appreciate the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation.
