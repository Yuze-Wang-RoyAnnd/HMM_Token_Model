as i've said in the title of this review, it pains me to say this, but "hitch" reaches the zenith of what hollywood romantic comedies can ever hope to aspire to. i've been a critic of both the genre and it's namesake for as long as i can remember myself, but on an almost tragic note, "hitch" has caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile plastered across my face.<br /><br />this movie may be misogynistic and presumptuous at times but it nonetheless possesses a certain humor about it whose subtlety may only be described as british. this is a wonderful attempt by hollywood to make (or remake as the case may be...) a film which appeals to all of our wishes for a romantic comedy which can make us both think and laugh simultaneously. i grudgingly and most evasively give this movie a 9 out of 10... something you shall hardly see me do for a romantic comedy in the near future, or so at least, i hope.
