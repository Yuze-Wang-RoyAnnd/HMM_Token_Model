the main reason i loved this movie is because imx (formerly immature) were in it. they were in house party 3 when they were 11, but they are all grown up now! i was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but i had to realize that they were not my little boys anymore. i think chris stokes did a pretty good job, considering that is was his first movie.
