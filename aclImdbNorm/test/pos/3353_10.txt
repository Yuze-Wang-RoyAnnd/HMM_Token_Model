this is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. i mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! there is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? this belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including debby does dallas, deep throat, and behind the green door. i think the problem with "pornographic movies" these days is that it's all about the "pornographic" and not about the "movie". alice in wonderland has graphic depictions of sex, sure, but it is actually telling a story at the same time. not one of the typical "oh, mr. police man, don't write me a ticket" plots, this takes it another step further and makes it a musical! fabulous! if you want to see an example of "good" porn, this is one of the best.
