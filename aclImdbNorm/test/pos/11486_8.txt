once the slow beginning gets underway, the film kicks off and really becomes quite a lot of fun in many unexpected ways. the ensemble cast is really good, with heather graham perhaps being the weakest of them. casey affleck as her brother is really good and extremely likeable , if you catch my drift.<br /><br />i highly recommend the film if you just want to have to good hours. teenagers should really enjoy this film - it says a lot about relationships.
