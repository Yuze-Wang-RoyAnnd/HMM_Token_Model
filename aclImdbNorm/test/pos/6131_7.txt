this is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it really happend! in case you haven't noticed: it's based on a true story.<br /><br />(possible spoiler)<br /><br />imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once a ss officer in ww ii.<br /><br />it's a very intriguing story and i'm really surprised the movie is rated a lousy 5.3 here on imdb.com.<br /><br />my rate: 7
