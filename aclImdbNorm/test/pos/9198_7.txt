i had heard interesting critics on this movie. i believed it was a love story but i wasn't sure what was the plot about. so, when i finally saw it, i found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex-con isabel (isabel ampudia) and the junkie rufo (sebasti'an haro). so, a love story but not probably what i was expecting.<br /><br />the movie is focused on isabel, as she struggles to get back into society. she doesn't want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without a home or anywhere to go. so, while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across rufo, an old acquittance of her which while she was in had become a junkie and lives on the streets. not having where to go, and without money or feasible source of income, she decides to join rufo on his residence: a covered area on a lonely street.<br /><br />the story by itself is moving. it explains how the, impossible, relationship between isabel and rufo gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie.<br /><br />definitely, the movie is worth watching. sebasti'an haro is splendid in his role of the junkie. a person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street scum. just depending whom deals him with. i believe his role.<br /><br />on the other hand, i don't quite believe the role of isabel ampudia. although the movie tries to show the bitterness inside her through several scenes, she is not capable to make me believe it. she is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation.<br /><br />the movie tries to show a love on a desperate situation. it is a enjoyable movie. but the feeling i get when the movie ends is that isabel, with the way of thinking and acting she has, would never have arrived to that situation. her role, partly because of the script, partly because of the acting is difficult to believe.<br /><br />i specially like the ending, and because of it i have raised my rating one or two points. i liked its bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes, survival instinct is above other more spiritual considerations as love.<br /><br />summarizing, an interesting movie, but it lacked some punch to be a total "must see".
