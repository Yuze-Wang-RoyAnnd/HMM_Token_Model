there was a lot about little vera that was strange to me. all in all i did enjoy this movie, but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what i was used to. for example the environment that vera's family lived in was very tense. almost every time the family was together they were either drinking, fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three. after i had viewed the film i felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it. i was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class russian family. throughout the entire film we are reminded of the industrialized state of russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen. it gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life. the characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. there was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film. the only time a character was not yelling was when vera first fell in love with her fianc'e sergei. this was very short lived because the viewer later discovers (after sergei locks vera's father in a bathroom and vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab sergei) that he is abusive. another time vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment. it is very interesting watching how both vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior. the film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of russia.
