it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it...so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women. first of all...this is a true story so you cant say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid. personally i think this was the best love story i've ever seen. and i am very pro gay. i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex. and it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so many other shows. maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv...plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things.<br /><br />if you want something funny with one of englands best (lesley sharp) and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you. i know i love it
