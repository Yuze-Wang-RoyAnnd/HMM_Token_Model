this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen. danny de vito plays owen perfectly. momma is excellently portrayed, and was one of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />at the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect. larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles. larry teaches a writing class and owen tagged after larry trying to get him to read his story. owen eventually asks larry to kill his mother, and in return owen would kill larry's ex-wife. the whole movie was really hilarious.<br /><br />one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when owen writes "throw momma from the train". larry gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot. it turns out that owen wrote a children's pop-up book.<br /><br />i would really recommend this movie. i gave it a 10.
