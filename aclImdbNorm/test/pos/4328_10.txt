jack, sawyer and sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted desmond. his traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. sayid plots a plan with jack to surprise "the others" in case michael is double-crossing the group. john locke convinces desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by mr. eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.<br /><br />this episode is one of the best of the second season. unfortunately, we lovers of "lost" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans. in the usa, the air date of this episode was 24 may 2006. therefore, along this period, fans have to wait for the third season in a very suspenseful situation, with jack and his group surrounded by "the others" and finding the truth about michael and the death of ana lucia and libby; john locked inside the hatch without the intention of pushing the button and mr. eko in despair outside the hatch. i hope the fate of "lost" be better than "angel" and its very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. my vote is ten.<br /><br />title (brazil): not available
