as a non-theist im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. nuff said there then.<br /><br />the film was produced by the bbc, and to be honest, it could quite easily have been shown on television. while the acting is superb, the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release. that said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then so be it. but i have seen many period style dramas on bbc tv and they were well up to the finished standard of this. just don't expect too much of a big budget thrill ride when going to see it.<br /><br />in some ways, i found the movie almost going out on a limb to apologise to religious fundamentalists. while it attains a good sense of tension the whole way through, i couldn't help wanting it to get to the publication of the origin of species much quicker than it actually did (you'll wait right until the end for that). and it seemed to dwell much more than i was ever aware on darwin's struggle with himself and his wife emma, portraying him almost as some kind of insane lunatic at times - which is hardly true. there are many other errors and facts missing in relation to the real story of the lead up to the publication of origin too, but the whole premise of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty darwin faced domestically with the book, and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter annie. this gives the film its most moving scene, where annie passes away as she asks one final time to hear darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan which died of pneumonia. though, you'll probably feel a bigger connection with the primate in that scene than with darwin's daughter.<br /><br />with the early controversy apparently surrounding the movie in the usa it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will get to see it. but to be honest, there is actually very little in it that insults any mythical godhead. its hardly headline news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all. but, as fundamental christians (and many other religions which we're all well aware of) like to wave a placard or two whenever possible, i guess this movie is as good excuse as any. personally, i cant see what all the fuss is about. but maybe they're just monkeying around...
