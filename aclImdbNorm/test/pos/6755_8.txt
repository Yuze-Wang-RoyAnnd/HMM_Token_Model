one of starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. with the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz's films. the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz's old style of puppetry. live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz's utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil's club scene. twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. overall, starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.
