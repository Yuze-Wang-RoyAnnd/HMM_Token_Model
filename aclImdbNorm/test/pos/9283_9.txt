yes non-singaporean's can't see what's the big deal about this film. some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually 'get' it. but i plead with you, foreigner, look at the other crap that's been churned out from singapore and compare it to this film. it's like comparing a mule's diarhhoea chunks to a little diamond. this film is the first to truly show some the singapore's seedy underbelly - something the forces that be, pretend does not exist. and there's a part in the film where a gangster(ah-beng in our unique colloquial 'ingris') curses in 4 languages, namely tamil english malay and hokkien. well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time. the sad thing is that viewers from foreign contries will have an easier time getting their oily little claws on this gem, in its country of origin, it was banned initially, only to be given and r-rating, and that too with about 20 cuts to it. it's nice to know you that one of the best, creative, edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to obtain unadulterated, uncensored; halfway across the world than in your own nation.
