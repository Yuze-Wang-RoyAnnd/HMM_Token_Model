i love this film...! i've seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it. it has it all, comedy, awesome action and incredible stunts/fx. samuel jackson steals the show here big time. i dont think there isnt a moment that he's in that he isnt funny! "everyone knows that when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of you and umption"!! the f/x are great! the bridge/truck explosion is incredible, although the sound isnt all that great!when samuel drives out of the truck, the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless!!! for those of you who own it on dvd, put the audio in french!!! it's halarious!!! even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that sam's/charlie's daughter is his, is great... this is a great film that no action fan can do without... i also reccomend cutthroat island... aside from all the negative publicity, it kicks!!!!
