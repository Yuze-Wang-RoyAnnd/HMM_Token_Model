wicked little things was a really good movie.i will say at some parts it seemed really unbelievable, and others it seemed as if there just wasn't enough thought put into the actions of the characters, but overall it was exciting and entertaining.i don't understand why this movie's rating is so low.nor do i not understand why all the afterdark horrorfest film's ratings are so low.these are b-movies people, and nothing more.they provide great entertainment and most of them don't have many flaws at all.this is definitely worth a look, because you won't be disappointed with the outcome.wicked little things is one of the best 1st annual afterdark horrorfest films, and compared to a lot of other films in the series, this is one of the best overall.
