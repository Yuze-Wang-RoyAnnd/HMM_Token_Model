with the fairly recent release of carlos saura's 'fados' in the united states (albiet a limited art house only release),it's high time for a re-release of this fine documentary on amalia rodrigues. this film is a treasure chest of vintage film clips of amalia on portugese & american television,as well as various other film clips,including one of her & her mother that could easily reduce the most macho man to tears. i first saw this fine documentary a few years back,when it received the unjustified "art house" release (it deserved far better). fortunately, various recordings exist of amalia's best recordings on various "budget line" recordings (which are generally available in places such as k-mart,or best buy),or if you do a little searching,one can fine some of the original releases,either on e-bay,or one of those distribution services that specializes in pricey european imported cd's. there are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation (the original portugese version,with no english subtitles, and the u.s. version in portugese with english subtitles,except the european version cannot be played on most u.s.dvd players,due to the pal colour line system). not rated by the mpaa,but contains nothing to offend.
