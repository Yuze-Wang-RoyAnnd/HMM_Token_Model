following a mugging incident at new york's grand central station, an innocent bystander (kevin spacey, "the usual suspects") is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. we can understand why they think this, considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really bright." and so prot (as he identifies himself, pronounced as rhyming with "goat,") is shipped off to the psychiatric institute of manhattan, where a weary workaholic doctor, mark powell (jeff bridges, "the big lebowski"), attempts to understand this man's so-called delusion.<br /><br />prot's manner is courteous and cooperative. when asked why he believes he has been institutionalised, he matter-of-factly replies that it is because "you think i'm crazy." within minutes, after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for earth-fruit, the completely forthright prot has revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet k-pax, which resides 1000 light-years away, circling the binary star system agape and satori located in the lyra constellation. he also details how his infinitely-more advanced species has already mastered faster-than-light travel, through harnessing the energy of light, an accomplishment that is allegedly eons away for the human race.<br /><br />powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, though he is nevertheless fascinated by them, and commits himself to understanding how prot came to believe such a thing. meanwhile, prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, eventually offering everybody around him something to live for, and hope of a cure. on july 27, prot later reveals, he will depart again for k-pax, and he can only take one human with him. of what will actually happen on that date, nobody is certain.<br /><br />originally slated to play dr. powell
