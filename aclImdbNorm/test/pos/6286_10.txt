this was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. the movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. still, an unlikely match for rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. when he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. when she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. you kind of learn what a good friend crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. when her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks crawl and puts him on the spot. he tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. well they never really show a close up of the ring). the message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after rebecca,(amber thesan) and crawl, so that rebecca would have broken up with crawl, thinking they were a couple. although they were not, rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but i think they were starting to like one another. and i think she thought there was more. the movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. they never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. that was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. and she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. rebecca almost did. even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. in the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which crawl proved to be, through his friendship with rebecca. but when i saw the movie, i must admit, if i went for looks, i thought i would have gone for the first boyfriend. still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.
