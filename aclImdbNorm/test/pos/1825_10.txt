valley girl will always hold a special place in my heart: i would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen-sex-comedies, but that is a back-handed compliment. this is a good movie, period. it is very specific in time and place--nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot--yet its story remains timeless. (this is just romeo and juliet, minus the death, after all!) nicolas cage is wonderful, showing all the early promise that, it turns out, he has squandered on overblown action crapola. deborah foreman is the revelation of this movie, and i can't believe she didn't go on to have a bigger career; someone rediscover her quick. this is sweeter and gentler than most films of the genre--the requisite nudity seems thrown in by contractual obligation--and, while not groundbreaking, it certainly is nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and doesn't crucify its shallow young girls for having fun--even foreman's crew of best friends, misguided by peer pressure, are never presented as villains. (indeed, her friend stacy, forced to doubledate w/ cage's friend fred, has a good time despite her protests, and makes out w/ fred in the backseat.) this will take you back to the early 80's if you were there, but it holds up quite well today. warning to those unfamiliar with the movie: do not watch one of vh1's seemingly continual showings of it--go rent it in its unedited glory. otherwise, you are missing some of the movies' most potent, time-specific dialogue. and one can't write about valley girl and not mention the fabu soundtrack of great 80's tunes--most of them by one-hit wonders, which are not only integral to the sense of time and place in this movie, but thematically well-chosen. see it--awesome little flick! fer shur!!
