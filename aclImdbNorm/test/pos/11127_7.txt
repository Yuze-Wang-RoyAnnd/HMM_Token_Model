if your looking for a movie with fantastic music, nice cast and a storyline that is not to difficult to understand; fame is for you.<br /><br />i have several scenes that i love in this movie; some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. the editing i think is wonderful, really fast and often funny. shure, maybe there would have been some more potential in the whole thing, all the story's stay somehow on the surface; maybe a bit too many characters are involved.but i don't care, because the real stars are...<br /><br />...the musical scenes! one of my favorites: the hot-lunch-jam sequence. that piece is just so raw, funky and filmed in a special way (handcamera-style in "music-hell-breaking-loose"), its just electrifying! i miss this raw energy in todays music-clips; the only similar energy i found perhaps in bette midlers "the rose", all of the concert footage.its about capturing something "wild" that is "realy" happening, and not doing it just perfect; take by take.<br /><br />so, fame is a wonderful nostalgia-trip to when synthesizers where heavy and walk-mans not available.i recommend it once a year; sure not for everyone.
