_the wild life_ has an obvious resemblance to _fast times at ridgemont high_, and _the wild life_ comes up short.<br /><br />------------ <br /><br />some other stan wrote the above comment. of course the wild life is no ridgemont. ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. however, the wild life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). the little latino from scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful ("i got visa...masterrrrr charrrrge!!") the colonel also makes an appearance ("lawsuit..."). rip the colonel 1931-1997.<br /><br />this movie is no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres, btw. it is no worse than a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies at that. it does very much have the feel of a cameron crowe movie. only staniels gave it a 5.
