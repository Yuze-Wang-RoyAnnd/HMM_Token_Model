okay. here's the thing. i've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, darkest, blackest comedy ever made. whiffs of tarantino, etc. well, not exactly. but, guess what? it's still an enjoyable and, ultimately, funny film. not brilliant, not trash. liv tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her. she's a woman with very strong decorating ideas...matt dillon, a greatly underrated and under-used actor, is wonderful, as ever. he always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul, and he pulls off the comedy beautifully. ditto john goodman (though the religious overtones, probably funny in the script, really don't work). paul reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on tv.<br /><br />the usually unbearable michael douglas is actually great in this role. as for his coif, well, see the film. between this and "wonder boys," you're actually reminded of the fact that douglas can act. the movie will make you laugh in parts. okay, not exactly belly-laughing, but definitely in the i'm-amused-i'm-very-amused category. if you're renting this expecting to see another "pulp fiction," forget it. but if want something kinda hip and kinda fun, this is a damned good choice.
