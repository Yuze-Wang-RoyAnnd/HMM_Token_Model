i saw the movie in izmir as the closing film of izmir film festival. i didn't know anything about it but right now i'm glad i didn't refuse the chance to see ding-a-ling-less! it is one of the funniest movies i've ever watched and believe me i've seen zillions of movies!! (i'm a film critic!) clever script and dialogs... smart details... what else can i say? an indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor... one can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now. ding-a-ling less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director onur tukel is more mature now. i heard that his next feature will be a political satire and i really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like "house of pancakes"...
