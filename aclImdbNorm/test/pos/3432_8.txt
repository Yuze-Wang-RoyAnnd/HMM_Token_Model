very funny film with some of the best swedish actors. it's all filmed in black and white with the true 40-ish feeling. most of the film you are aboard a train headed for berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns. i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh.
