but george and gracie's are not among them. the movie is fun and the pool table scene with wc fields has to be among the funniest i have ever seen but gracie and george are more irritating than comical in their roles, partly from script deficiency and partly from their interpretation. i gave it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, wc is a treasure of comedic timing and energy in this one.
