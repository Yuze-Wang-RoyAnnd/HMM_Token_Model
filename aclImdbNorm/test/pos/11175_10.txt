first i played the second monkey island game, and i liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound. then a few months later, i found out a new game was made. i tried it out and liked it a lot. first thing you notice is the great graphics. the areas are huge, colorful, and detailed, with lots to explore. the game requires you to use your brain, a lot, as always. the game is challenging, with all point and click games, frustrating. the jokes haven't gotten old a third time around. the animated cut scenes are a great addition to the game also. this is the best mi game out there, perhaps the best p&c game too! if you like cartoony games that play like a movie, get this game!
