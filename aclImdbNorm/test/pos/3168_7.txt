i thought this was very "different" compared to most modern interpretations of shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly. it would not be useful for those studying it at school etc. as it does not show the traditional shakespeare character interpretations (i.e- miranda is portrayed quite punky compared to your traditional shakespeare lady) but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch. it does not include also the correct format, as in the layout of acts and scenes as i am currently playing miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and i would definitely recommend it as a must-see even if just to say you've seen it! shakespeare fans would love this!
