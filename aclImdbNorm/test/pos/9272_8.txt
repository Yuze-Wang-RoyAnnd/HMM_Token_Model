remember greg the bunny? it was this show that started on the independent film channel, but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox. my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny, beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tv-pg material. puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe, where puppets live in the same world as people, and like us, take on jobs and lives of their own. let's just say if you couldn't handle that, then don't bother watching pwk, as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of society's good graces through drug abuse, hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a half-way house. there's plenty of violence, sex, and bad language (so it would never make its way to u.s. network tv). as if sociopathic puppets weren't enough, the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing (btw, the government pays for this), and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this. i don't know where you can get it in the u.s., beyond extra satellite tv, but i'd advise you give it a try. really funny stuff. (it airs on the comedy network in canada)
