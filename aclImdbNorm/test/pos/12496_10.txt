i love this show. my girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched wonder showzen one night. luckily, she killed herself before the baby was born. though technically i think it was considered a murder-suicide.<br /><br />my first thoughts upon seeing wonder showzen? now i know what god watches when he jerks off all the time.<br /><br />wonder showzen is to television what a toaster in the bathtub is to my self-esteem.<br /><br />you know how george w. bush makes speaking gaffes all the time? tyler wouldn't. tyler's good. tyler cuts his nails. he's tyler. he's good. tyyyllerrr...
