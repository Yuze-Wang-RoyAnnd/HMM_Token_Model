everybody interested in texas needs to have this dvd. it's just a good movie about real texas with great scenes. it took a bunch of texans to do this right. hollywood never would have gotten it. there are so many subtle things that tubb put in the movie and may not have even thought about, but it makes the show.<br /><br />guest cameos are not seen as cameos at all. each star fits in perfectly and does not distract from the film. many of the guests spots blend so perfect that when the credits roll you will go back through the movie to find the character. strait's roll is dead on, it could not have been done any better in real life.<br /><br />the second half of the movie is completely different from the first, it get's a little "hokey", but that's alright. somehow the storyline works. the "hokey" stuff is like an after school special but it looks believable and natural.<br /><br />i have never heard anyone use the sonny pruitt line before, other than locals that i grew up with. that was the icing on the cake for me.<br /><br />definitely a collectible, right up there with pure country, sugarland express, jr. bonner, texasville, the last picture show, giant, and of course hud.<br /><br />gig'em aggies '86
