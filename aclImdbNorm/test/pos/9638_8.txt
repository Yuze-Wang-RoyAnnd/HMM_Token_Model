in my personal opinion - <<the patriot>> is one of the best steven seagal movies.<br /><br />i've heard people say it's the worst one ever, it's not like ss etc. i disagree. as a highly spiritual person, a great master seagal established a good tradition in action movies. he always has a good background, great action, high professionalism and a clever message. this movie has it all. you have good shooting scenes, great aikido. although there isn't a lot of it, it shows us its peaceful side. this change in his film making only proves his spiritual growth (he doesn't kill chisolm's buddy in the end).<br /><br /><<the patriot>> is definitely one of the best films from the <<filmmaker's>> point of view which i have seen lately. you have great panoramic shots of montana, we see real american nature and beautiful wildlife(among others - horses and flowers). the soundtrack also deserves a few words. during the film i had a great opportunity to listen to classical american-cowboy-western music(not country though). similar music was heard in <<back to the future prt.3>>. ss's acting has greatly improved since his last films. his role is unfamiliar to him(unlike cops & commandos), but he does a good job playing the-retired-doctor-from-the-government. his acting is convincing and his lines are good.<br /><br />i was really pleased with the cast. lq jones proves that life & death walk the earth together, whitney yellow robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist, camilla belle makes a great appearance as mcclaren's daughter.<br /><br />mr.seagal discusses the much debated <<real american>> tradition and the militia squads, providing his own point of view(he likes the constitution just fine, but chubby bearded men have nothing to do with it). also good points are raised regarding the eastern-western medicine system and nature.<br /><br />seagal's best. and opening new horizons in his film career.<br /><br />
