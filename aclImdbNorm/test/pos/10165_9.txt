the movie, which was directed by alfred hitchcock, was brilliantly made. it starts with a family of three, a doctor (james stewart), his wife (doris day)- who is a former stage singer, and their young son- my guess is about 10 years old, who are traveling through morroco for leisure. on the bus, the bump into a french government agent, and they are a little too nice to him. he is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought. he wants to carry this information out to someone, so he goes to the only person he, even slightly, knows: james stewart. the antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. stewart has to travel to london, because that is where his son is, and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be. the movie is very suspenseful. there are many twists and turns (typical hitchcock movie). also, it has just the right amount of comic relief. in addition to all of that, it won an oscar for doris day's performance of "que sara, sara." this movie is very good. it is hard to find a problem about it. i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. i give this movie an "a-" only because it is a little bit predictable.
