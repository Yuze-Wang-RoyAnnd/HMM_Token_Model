the visual effectiveness of this film is unmatched by anything i've seen. and the work required to make achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious (you don't just stick "kodak grainy film" in your camera to get this look). don't watch this film to be entertained, watch it to be visually stimulated, watch it to be challenged and provoked in your thoughts on film and any other topic that comes to mind, religion will likely be one thought.<br /><br />
