i decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on imdb it is cited that john woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-american years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest, made in us films, plans to remake it. well, here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: the plot of the film is simple and even clich'ed by today's standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads, unique direction by mellville, cinematography, music and its style. there is no way any director today can make such film, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's box-office targeted movie business. <br /><br />john woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from melville's le samourai - the killer, but remember, it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but cheap (in acting merits) actors. so what i'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made, together with another film by melville - le samourai. watch it. and even if the remake will be made, try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.
