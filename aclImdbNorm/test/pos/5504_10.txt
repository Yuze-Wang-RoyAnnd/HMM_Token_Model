i think this movie is the most misunderstood film in jerry lewis career. it's little slow starting, but after it gets going is very funny & jerry's use of irony like never before in his earlier films..., ie, who's minding the store, the nutty professor, etc., the idea, is clear, it's a mock of the dirty dozen, instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that film, you have 4, 4-f's & 2 tag alongs. including the former l.a. dodgers all-star centerfielder, willie davis as linc! hilarious! love that movie!
