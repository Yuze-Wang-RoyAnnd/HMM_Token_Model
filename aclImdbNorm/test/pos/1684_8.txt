over the many years, there are some films that just slip by & hardly anyone views. <br /><br />choose conner is one of those films.<br /><br />this small gem played at some festivals & had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in west hollywood making all of about $ 5500.<br /><br />it is now on dvd i do hope many more will now see this,.<br /><br />it is a strange drama of a shrewd youngish politician, who influences a very bright 15 year old lad.this politico also has a handsome nephew (about 17 years old) who befriends the 15 year old lad.<br /><br />the above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs, so is the film, & that is what i appreciated, we do not get all the facts,much is left to our own thinking. you will hear dialog that makes this logical..<br /><br />steven weber (wings) is our politician,his role is slightly vague,this is another point for the audience to ponder<br /><br />alex d.linz is our 15 year old, he was about 17 when they made this movie, but easily can pass for younger. he has been in films & tv since he was a young child, he is a very good actor & is quite convincing.<br /><br />escher holloway is the older teen, this role is his first major part & he too is excellent.<br /><br />now i am saving the best for last, the writer/director,<br /><br />luke eberl is not yet 23 years old. for a first effort a big thumbs up. i do hope he as well as our 2 lads have a long career.<br /><br />ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points(out of 100) imdb 8 (out of 10)
