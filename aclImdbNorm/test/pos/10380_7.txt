nva combines eastalgia-humor, military comedy and teen movie. although it is somehow typically german-movie-like sentimental, i think it's a great and very funny movie. you will not only laugh in nva but also get a bit of an insight in the eastern germany armed forces of the late 1980ies and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the german democratic republic.<br /><br />you will enjoy nva if you liked sonnenallee (another movie directed by leander haussmann), but not necessarily if you enjoyed good bye lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny.<br /><br />the acting is acceptable. but watch for former boy band singer kim frank who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked saucer-eyed!
