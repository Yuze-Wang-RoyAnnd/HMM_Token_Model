i had the privilege of attending the uk premier of inglorious basterds this evening! having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)<br /><br />i was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. the film is rich with interesting dialogue, perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.<br /><br />the crowning glory of this film though lies with christoph waltz whom no fault or error can be found. he manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite "theatrical" (couldn't think of a better word). he definitely deserved his prize at cannes and is heading for an oscar no doubt!!!! hoping to see him in something again soon!
