working at a movie theater as a projectionist, i have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. when i first saw the trailer for 'black snake moan' i laughed and thought, "great. another 'snakes on a plane' samuel l jackson movie". but of course, i wanted to see it for the laugh factor. many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that justin timberlake is in the film. personally i loved every second of this movie. it tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. the story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. of course, i do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from sam jackson, christina ricci and,yes, even justin timberlake, i encourage you to see 'black snake moan'.
