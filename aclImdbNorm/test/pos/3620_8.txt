obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious "mandingo," this crassly pandering hunk of blithely rancid italian sexploitation junk really pours on the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint: the evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky both each other and their various slaves. director mario penzauti and screenwriter tecla romanelli cram this fetid filth with a teeming surplus of sizzling sleaze: we've got nasty rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stud while he's tied to a cross), copious female nudity, brutal whippings, vile degradation, lots of lurid soft-core sex, and a severely twisted tragic surprise ending that mixes elements of incest, murder and miscegenation in a questionable attempt at making a statement about the horrid inhumanity of slavery. special kudos are in order for foxy brunette actress paola d'egidio, whose lusty and uninhibited portrayal of depraved and lascivious wicked bitch rhonda positively burns up the screen. moreover, marcello giombini's funky, throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot. maurizo centini's fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick. a satisfyingly seamy chunk of slimy swill.
