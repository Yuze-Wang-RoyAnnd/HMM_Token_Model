my god, this is funny stuff. yes, it's puerile in the extreme, but also rather witty ("here's the page with all the wines on it." "it's a little early for us, i'm afraid." "well, what are you doing up then?") and the fight sequences are second to none. despite what you may have heard, the laughs *do* keep coming, and at a surprisingly generous rate. the sheer comic abilities of rik mayall and adrian edmondson help keep it riotously funny. wringing every drop of comedy from the script. i can only compare it to "fear and loathing in las vegas" - you either find that film hysterical throughout or not at all; the same applies here. it's probably the funniest british film since "withnail and i", but to say it's an acquired taste is something of a gross (sic) understatement.
