it has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. initially, i was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. i thought that such a sensational subject needed the ken russell treatment to take it way over the top. i now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by mishima's widow) to be an asset. some of the more lurid aspects of mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels. i think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me. still feel the film overall could be a little tighter and warmer, but it's genuinely unique, and deserves serious attention. love the fact that the japanese characters speak japanese - not english. the philip glass score is mesmerizing.
