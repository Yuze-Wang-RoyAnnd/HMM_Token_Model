i saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. the cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. if this movie does not do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve to. before this film, i didn't realize how charming shia lebouf could be. he does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. there's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. the other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. <br /><br />this is one i'd recommend to anyone.
