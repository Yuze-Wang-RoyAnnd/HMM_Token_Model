hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. watch out cause slaughter is back in town! if you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in mexico. but if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. why, i don't know. was 'hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? any who. the movie starts off with the old "assassination from a plane" routine. we all know that that is the most effective way for taking out one guy in a picnic, full of people. needless to say slaughter survives the ordeal, but cmndt. eric lassard, sorry george gaynes i mean isn't that lucky. smack!! also slaughters best friend pratt is killed. this is the start of a grand adventure, filled with the hippest, funkiest music james brown himself has to offer. that's right 'the godfather of soul' has put his trademark up on this bad-boy. in addition to jim brown in the lead part, this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene has to offer. how about scatman crothers, dick anthony williams, gloria hendry and brock peters. in other parts we see none other than judith m. brown and last but definitely least the fantastic don stroud as the evil henchman.
