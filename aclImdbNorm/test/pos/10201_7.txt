western union tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west. siblings dean jagger and virginia gilmore work for western union, and randolph scott and robert young work for the creightons. indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop america's progress. this sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and vibrant color photography. scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways, and both he and engineer young vie for the attention of the perky gilmore. lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward.
