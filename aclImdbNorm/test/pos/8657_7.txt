the bothersome man is a smart, surreal movie that makes you reevaluate what you're doing with your life and what makes you tick. when you see these people in zombie like trances doing everyday events and realize that's what we do and what we want in real life it really hits close to home. this is a surprisingly effective movie that at the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much the movie. <br /><br />andreas is the main character whose life we get a 3rd person view of as he tries to adapt to a new life after being relocated. in the beginning he seems to be the most popular guy in town as everyone at work caters to him and he's invited to dinners etc. a good example of this is in the scene with his new boss who offers him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying "here's a little something to get you started". andreas even gets a girlfriend 20 minutes into the movie, which he eventually moves in with. this seems like an ideal living situation as his girlfriend is an established interior designer, attractive, and doesn't ever nag about anything he does. but andreas is unfulfilled with their relationship as with everything else in this world. he then begins an affair with a coworker named ingeborg who he eventually leaves anne for and claims he is in love with. after telling ingeborg how he feels she tells him that she is also seeing other coworkers and says all of the relationships are "nice". soon after we see andreas at a train station where he tries to end his misery and to the audience's disappointment doesn't come about. still looking for salvation andreas meets hugo who has found a hole which music can be heard coming out of. so they embark on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or will it be worse? <br /><br />"the bothersome man" shows us society's obsession with appearances and its materialistic mindset. it does a great job making fun of us by filling homes with ikea products that the characters spend each lunch picking out. i think he is mostly poking fun at the dull scandinavian society and its high suicide rates. for example there is a scene in the movie where andreas comes across a man who jumped out of a building and onto a spiked fence. also, andreas fed up with this world cuts his finger off and then later jumps in front of a train; this is one of the most weirdest/outrageous scenes i've seen. this world created by lien is equivalent to purgatory where there is no punishment or reward. in this world drink after drink andreas never got drunk, sex was unfulfilling, and no matter how many times he tried he couldn't kill himself. this movie reminded me of "fight club" and how both main characters were kind of out of sync with the world around them. in "fight club" tyler durden creates a second persona that does everything he wouldn't and in this movie the awakened andreas is the equivalent to tyler durden. after a while he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life he is now apart of by escaping through a hole in a wall. <br /><br />lien does a great job with continuity in this movie meaning when a character has a half full cup in his hand and they cut away then come back they have the glass in the same hand and its not full or empty showing that the shot was done another day. nowadays directors are more worried about the sound effects and overlook the little things like is that character wearing the bracelet on the same hand as yesterdays filming? since i took tv production for three years in high school it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice overs which drive me nuts. lien does the little things well he's got great lighting in each shot, never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and brings about an interesting topic. this film really worked for me because it not only mocks scandinavians' but the western society and what's wrong with it. the only real issue i had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a spiked fence. because you eventually find out this world has no death but he laid motionless forcing you to assume he was dead and this never gets answered in my opinion. <br /><br />andreas is the only main character as others come and go and never do more than support his him. his first girlfriend anne britt is an interior designer who at the surface seems perfect for him but eventually turns out to be dull. this leads him to ingeborg who he starts an affair with and falls in love with. he soon finds out that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. andreas eventually meets hugo in the bathroom of a bar complaining about how nothing tastes good anymore and how he can't even get drunk anymore. he follows hugo home to find the hole in the wall with that is filled with children's laughter and birds chirping. <br /><br />lien doesn't have a lot on the resume but "the bothersome man" is more than a jump start to a great career but a preview of an up and coming director. if this is any indication of his talent and potential as a story teller, lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future movies don't take so long to make it overseas for our viewing pleasure. so take a seat and enjoy the ride as director jens lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the dreamlike world that is "the bothersome man".
