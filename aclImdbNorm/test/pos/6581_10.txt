i saw this on dvd with subtitles, which made it a little frustrating to get through, because of the film's length. but i was riveted throughout all of it. that i was fascinated by the characters and always engrossed in the story, despite the subtitles, is a testament to the film's power. it's an amazing piece of work. i have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time. it's easily the best foreign film i've seen in the last twenty years or so. i would like to know the full story behind the making of this film. it must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations. its use of some hardcore scenes (on the tv in the motel room) may unfortunately make some people choose not to see it, but if you don't mind those, you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this one!
