one true thing proves that it's the characters which make a movie. streep will surely receive an oscar nomination for her role. a beautiful drama, one true thing is a prime example of movie-making in the late 1990's - there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. it's no best picture or anything... don't be silly. but the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock-wave. i cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for a 24 year old man.
