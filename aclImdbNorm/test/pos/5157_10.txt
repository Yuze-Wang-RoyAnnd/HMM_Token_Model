minor spoilers will follow.<br /><br />this movie is even more odd and unconventional than "songs from the second floor". there is no main character we follow around. there is no "plot" in the conventional way. there is no emphasis on an happy end. there is no crowdpleasing. in other words roy andersson is back with a vengeance. instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula roy andersson concentrates his film around an idea. i will not go into what that idea is, but even if you don't "get it" i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film. the majestic scenes from "songs" pale in comparison here. a work of visual splendor.<br /><br />so be kind to your fellow man, because after all "we are the living", and only you and i have the power to change our lives. that is at least what i thought when i saw the final scene in the movie, with the inhumane bomber planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away. <br /><br />and of course don't forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you. this is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person, like de sica's "bicycle thieves". a very warm and humanistic film.
