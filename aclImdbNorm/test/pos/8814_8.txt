every time i watch this film, it just really makes me wanna go out and have a good night! my mate uses "the weekend has landed" speech to psyche himself up before going out! and so do i...sometimes. <br /><br />this film is a great debut for the writer/director - well done mate!<br /><br />the acting is great, all the characters are believable and are larger than life! the 'weird' scenes are a joy to watch, jip's running mr floppy flashbacks/explanations/visualizations are all great! the scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone stands up and starts singing the mock national anthem is a laugh too. there's loads of comedy here - howard marks' 'spliff politics' speech is hilarious!<br /><br />oh god, you just need to see this. mind you, i felt the film did somewhat glorify the use of ecstacy, but hey, that's the truth of the matter eh? at least the film doesn't shy away from this fact. i suppose the film does carry a decent message to it as well - don't take life too seriously, you have to let you hair down sometime. and of course the chat in the pub when moff tries to explain to his mates that he's coming off the drugs is a sure reminder that when the come down's out-way the good times, you know the party's over!<br /><br />this is at times a very clever film in it's use of the camera, lighting, etc. it was a realised piece of cinema, and a great feel-good tale of mates, love, clubs, and drugs.<br /><br />get outta the 'rat race' people!!!<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />enjoy!
