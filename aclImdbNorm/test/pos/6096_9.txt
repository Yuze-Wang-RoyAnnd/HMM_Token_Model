this must be one of the funniest danish movies ever made. ulrich thomsen and thomas bo larsen are hilarious, as they drive across sweden. i don't know how ulrich thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. but if you don't understand danish (i am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this
