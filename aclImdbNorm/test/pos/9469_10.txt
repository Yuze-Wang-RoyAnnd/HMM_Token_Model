i thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. i already knew it was going to be a funny movie, but it was funnier than i expected. sure there were some lame jokes, but they cracked me up. i thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad, but the actors were good in acting out this comedy. i have to give kudos to amanda bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy. as for the other actors, they were funny as well. of course there were moments where you yell at the screen "how can you not tell?", but that's all part of the fun. in the end the plot turned out pretty well. there's a happy ending, but what'd you expect. <br /><br />overall,just hilarious.
