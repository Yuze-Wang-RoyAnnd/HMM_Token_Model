this is one of my favourite westerns. what a cast! glenn ford plays his role in his usual mild, controlled but firm manner. ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory. edward g robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch and barbera stanwyck plays his sly scheming wife. there is plenty of action in this western that is quite impressive, the scenery is delicious and the letterbox scope photography is breath taking and the soundtrack is stereo! i would say that this western had a size-able budget it looks expensive. one of a series of great glenn ford westerns.
