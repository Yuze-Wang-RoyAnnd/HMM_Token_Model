before seeing this picture i was quite skeptic, i don't like movies with an agenda nor do i appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer. i was also afraid this would be like the 2-part mini-series "10.4" which had a far-fetched concept, little relation to the real world and very poor execution. at the beginning is says: "this film is fiction, but the events portrayed and the information about uk emergency planning are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you're not being sold on an idea, but that you're being taught a lesson in civil awareness. the message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start: it is coming and we're not prepared. the use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen - there are plans for when it does - all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have, on even the most cynical of viewers. the movie's perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heart-breaking personal moments, which won't convey the message, so none of the romeo-juliet drama we're used to.
