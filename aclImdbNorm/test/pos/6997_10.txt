i really enjoyed this movie. it was edgy without being sociopath. vin diesel brought the riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels.<br /><br />i also saw iron giant and vin is perfect. (the snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called "triple-x," or "xxx" - was a weak example of his work.) in pitch black he plays an anti-hero to the max. i don't think you can go wrong when vin stars in a movie. unfortunately, hollowood might type cast him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! i think the script for "xxx" was weak for which vin couldn't act down to it.<br /><br />anyway, pitch black is a great scifi - see it!<br /><br />-zafoid
