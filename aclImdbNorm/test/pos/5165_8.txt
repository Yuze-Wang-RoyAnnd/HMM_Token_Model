i've already seen spin-offs of cartoons such as the flintstones, scooby doo, tom and jerry and looney tunes and most of them are great.<br /><br />when i saw the all grown up pilot in 2001, i thought it was interesting to see how the rugrats would look in their pre-teens/teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert, going to school and being grounded.<br /><br />the actual tv show is better because the rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and angelica doesn't get punished as much as she did in the original rugrats series. tommy and susie get punished in this series.<br /><br />i've also noticed references to rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the rugrats looked in the original series. they actually talk to the adults in this show because they're 10 years older.<br /><br />this show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original rugrats. viewers of the original show may like this.
