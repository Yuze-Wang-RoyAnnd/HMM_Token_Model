i watched this film during a special advanced preview in reading, berkshire.<br /><br />the two main characters, michael and rory strike up a friendship, when rory is introduced to the care home that michael already resides. michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him, as until now his cerebal palsey made people think that he couldn't communicate. <br /><br />rory introduces michael to the life that he's missing. rory is a feisty character, who doesn't let his condition (muscular dystrophy) get to him.<br /><br />they bond and apply for independent living, and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream of.<br /><br />don't go to see this film if you are after some "entertainment". do go see this film if you're willing to see something a little different.<br /><br />the storyline is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is uplifting.<br /><br />i thoroughly recommend it. though if you are anything like me and prone to crying - take tissues, as you'll need them!
