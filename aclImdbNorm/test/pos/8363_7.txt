the kid power hour featured two segments: hero high and shazam. let's start with hero high.<br /><br />hero high was intended to be a new archies cartoon, featuring their superhero identities: pureheart the powerful (archie), captain hero (jughead), superteen (betty), and evilheart (reggie). however, filmation couldn't get the rights to do it so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this. here's the breakdown of characters: captain california (archie), glorious gal (betty), weatherman (jughead), dirty trixie (veronica), rex ruthless (reggie), principal samson (mr weatherbee) and miss grimm (miss grundy). the show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. the humor was the typical lame filmation jokes, but at least it had a sense of fun about it. it was entertaining enough for kids, though not quite up to previous standards.<br /><br />the other segment was shazam!, which was very faithful to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. all of the major villains made appearances, as well as the entire marvel family (including freckles marvel, in at least one episode). uncle dudley had the correct wc fields voice and shady character, as well as his perpetually acting up "shazambago". burr middleton, a veteran of 70's tv shows, like fish, voiced the big red cheese, while alan oppenheimer (rudy wells in the early 6 million dollar man episodes and voice of skeletor in he-man) handled dr. sivana.<br /><br />the marvels had always had a sense of whimsy to them, so little alteration was required for their adventures, to meet the broadcast standards and practices requirements (the censors). as such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. amongst the villains who appeared were: dr. sivana, black adam, mr. atom, mr. mind, aunt minerva, ibac, and the crocodile creatures. mr. tawky tawny also made his on screen debut.<br /><br />hero high is due to be released from bci, but shazam! is still in limbo, as well as the live-action show. hopefully, the proposed movie will help shake them loose on dvd. it is well worth watching and deserving of dvd treatment.
