my family watches this movie over and over. even our 3 year old loves it. i like the "goodness" in the movie. giving the stranger a chance...showing goodwill to one obviously in need of some unconditional acceptance. the movie gives a feeling of goodwill and victory. one other aspect of the movie that makes it so appealing is the personalities of velvet's siblings. the bird lover. the bug lover. the boy lover! very cute and happy movie. there is one thing, however that is irritating about it. that is how mrs. brown often makes mr. brown look foolish or unwise. she, at times,comes off as a know it all, and he as a dimwit, which he is not. too bad to put that into such a nice story. nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful, old movie!
