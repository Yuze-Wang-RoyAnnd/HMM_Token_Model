if it had been made 2 years later it would have been banned! the number one must see recommendation of the day!. the best rouben mamoulian film i have seen this far (have but have not yet seen j+h).<br /><br />there's no wonder why this film got less than 200 votes. a bigger greyzone that could not care less about what's proper would not be seen again until the 60's. as morally ambiguous and dark as 70's grit but with a certain charm as well. of course this had to lay low in the later 30's and sadly it does not appear to have been re-discovered.<br /><br />seriously. this got it all. great actors: gary cooper, sylvia sidney and the this time not so lovable guy kibbee. and a mighty good director. this far i haven't been rm's biggest fans but i have liked his films a lot and with this he steps into a new league. one of the best 30's films i have ever seen! this is something i never thought even existed! 9.5/10
