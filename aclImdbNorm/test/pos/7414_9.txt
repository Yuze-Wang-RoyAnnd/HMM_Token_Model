how on earth this film isn't more widely regarded is beyond me.<br /><br />i picked it up for lb1, and i'm not exaggerating when i say it's the best pound i've ever spent on a film.<br /><br />the thing that usually lets films about the club scene down is either the music or the actual scenes filmed in clubland.<br /><br />here, the music and club scenes are completely credible,using some big tunes of the time, and filmed in real clubs, with people actually looking like they want to be there.<br /><br />the performances from the actors are of a high standard all round, although jason donovan in particular for me stands out (he was playing frank n furter in the rocky horror show in london at roughly the time this must have been filming, so his drag phase was in full flow!), and of course tim curry who's eloquent drug land boss is convincing.<br /><br />simply put, if you're a fan of british film you have to see this, it matters not a jot if you're into clubbing as the film is strong enough as a story anyway.<br /><br />highly recommended.
