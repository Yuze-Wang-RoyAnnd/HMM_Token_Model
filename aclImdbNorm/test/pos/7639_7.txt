i gave this movies a 7 out of 10. i think the general dislike of this movie is due to people not really understanding the plot. if you think about the story line this movie actually makes perfect sense, it just doesn't ever give you a dumbed-down explanation. its true that the special effects are sub-par and it appears semi low budget, but i think the originality of the plot keeps you drawn in. people say that the vampire genre is overdone and clich'ed out, but with bled, what you get is not your conventional vampire flick. its a dream/alternate reality story- line with a vampire/eternal life spin on it. i loved it. the only thing that kept me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that i personally dislike movies where most of the people have accents. but like i said earlier, if you really get the plot this is not a bad movie..
