frankly i just enjoy watching james caan. wonderful actor. with such simplicity you know exactly what he's thinking. a true pro.<br /><br />i have watched the show from the very beginning and found it different - that's something that is unique in hollywood - a new idea - not a 3rd version of a current hit show - <br /><br />i also find the show fun and exciting -i like the pacing - you're never bored - i especially like the mystery in each episode - the way it unfolds. i am a big mystery fan and have read a lot of the great mysteries but i find the stories in the show well written and the outcome is rarely obvious. also extremely interesting to me, probably because i am not a gambler, is the different cons that the 'gamblers' come up with - i was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to rob las vegas. the music: i like the music at the top of the show. absolutely perfect for the show...sets the tone and atmosphere . just marvelous. and of course, there is james caan.
