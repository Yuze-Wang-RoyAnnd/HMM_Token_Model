i just rented this movie from the video store last night. it being new and not released long ago here, the rent was only overnight. me, my little sis, and my older brother who usually hates watching these kind of movies sat down and watched. once the movie started and after sitting there watching it for a while we were all laughing historically. even my brother. this movie is hilarious, i actually laughed. no matter how funny some movies are... even if i think its funny i sometimes can't seem to laugh. but this movie... i laughed. my brother ended up thinking it was the best "that type of movie" he had seen. i ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later.
