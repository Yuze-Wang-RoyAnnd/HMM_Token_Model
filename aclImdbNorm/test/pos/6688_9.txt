i'm a fan of jeff bridges so i snapped this up on dvd without having seen it previously. i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey, also.<br /><br />the general plot of "alien in human body" has, in my experience, been done to death, but i liked the approach taken in k-pax, which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most. bridges makes an excellent doctor (you *want* to tell him what's on your mind) and spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role.<br /><br />the interaction between prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful, particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour.<br /><br />the ending is bittersweet - i like prot's choice, but the final scenes (with bridges) made me teary.
