didn't sound like it was from a fantasy film. the film is dark, with dark overtones. the soundtrack way too uplifting to the point it intruded on the visuals. i'm sure they were aiming for something militant, but it just didn't work. the scene when astin is attempting to escape is a perfect example. why does it sound like the goonies? there is no comedy, there is no brightness to this!! <br /><br />the idea of the movie is great, and the acting is very good as well. i enjoyed everyone's performances. it's available on netflix's online viewing. <br /><br />definitely worth a viewing, but write your own soundtrack!!
