this is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci-fi movie. balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together. she spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions. very atmospheric and effective. it is true that kinski does not appear very much in this film, but the staring actors are very good. there is only an english dubbed version available in the us, and the dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. the cinematography, by academy award winner vittorio storaro is excellent. an earlier giallo by director bazzoni, the fifth cord, is also excellent, and also lensed by storarro.
