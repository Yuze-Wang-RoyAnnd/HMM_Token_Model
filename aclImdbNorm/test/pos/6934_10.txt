just watched this one again. i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. this is why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and zombie bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone i have showed it to.<br /><br />the story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse. when a scarecrow (that is actually a demon i think) gets disturbed, it comes to life and re-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies.<br /><br />i loved this movie! from it's different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and great music, there was always something going on and it never bores you! sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. i have read other reviews and all i can say is that these people have missed the point. if you want 35mm full moon fluff, or if you are into modern stuff like urban legend, then i say pass on this. if you like low budget stuff like gates of hell and evil dead, i say buy this now.<br /><br />the make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. there is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! it is actually one of the better b-movies i have seen in ages.
