this movie almost has everything. the action is cool, it's funny, 2 great leading men and a truly nasty villain that i really hated. not a lot of films have bad bad guys. just mainly comic book villains. he really does deserve a might ass kicking.<br /><br />jake scott really does have his fathers talent for knowing how to make great visuals. the direction is faultless and has an irresistible lighthearted feel. i don't usually like films set in the old days but this i liked a lot because it makes a point of boring like so many other period films are (sense and sensibility, age of innocence and the absolute worst...lady and the duke). this will restore your faith. thanx mostly to craig armstrong's amazing score. the music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in scenes of action it is very exciting.<br /><br />the dvd is in dolby 5.1 and has a very grainy and muddy looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture.
