ok, if you would judge the movie to now a days it wouldn't fit in to well.if you watched fi now the stage and everything was pretty cheese ( i agree)but weren't all the movies in the 80's like that(gilligan,wonderwoman,aso).but too the people born in the early to mid 70's or earlier it has a cult status. evertime the plane was on approach tattoo would run up the tower ring the bell and with his accent would yell "da plane boss da plane" and you would wonder what everybody's wish would be.people who are born in the mid 80's or later wouldn't understand the hippe because if you watched it now.it don't have a harry potter,jurassic park computer animation fx.it was just a stage where you probably could even almost see the wire attached to a guy who's wish was too be able to fly.but to us during that time it was a fantasy island.
