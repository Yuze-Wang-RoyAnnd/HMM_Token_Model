based on the true story about christopher boyce (hutton) and daulton lee (penn), and their involvement in selling american secret government documents to the soviets during the 1970s. boyce works for the government, and his job is to guard these particular documents, which ultimately disillusions him about his country's affairs and practices. he then enlists his drug-dealer friend, daulton lee, who has become a wanted man, to be the courier for these sensitive documents. lee infiltrates the russian embassy in mexico, and makes contact with alex (suchet), and they both begin to play the espionage game.<br /><br />lee's interest is purely about money whilst boyce is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in. alex believes lee to be the inside man in the american government. things start to become array when lee's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the courier position offsets both alex and boyce. lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved.<br /><br />this is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action. the character motives and analysis of real-life subjects is sympathetic but very well written, and the film cleverly interweaves the real-life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behaviour. where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations. well directed, and intense in parts, especially where the protagonists become immensely in over their heads in the spy game. timothy hutton and sean penn give amazingly riveting performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system. the plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within 'the falcon and the snowman', and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society, human relationships, and the american system. great film!<br /><br />****1/2 out of *****!
