i have never forgot this movie. all these years and it has remained in my life. i have looked for this movie on so many sites and stores. if anyone ever reads this and has a copy i will pay you for a copy of it or please let me know where i could find one. this is a movie that should be a classic romance known as well as my other favorite, somewhere in time. it was truly brilliant. if the right actors would remake this film and give it the patience it needs, to be the right acting, it could be a block buster.a love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see. i remember how sad i was at the ending and it really came as a shock. i believe with all my heart that johnny really loved the woman and she him. this was one terrific movie and it is a shame that it is not available for us to purchase. please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - i want to give my thanks to a wonderful lady that responded to my message almost a year later. she had a copy of the movie and was so kind to send it to me. she is a great fan of this movie as i am. with her help, there have been 3 happy ladies to receive these dvds'. she is waiting for the book that it is based on. i am checking with my local library for it, titled 'mrs maitlands affair, by margarett lynn. i am sure it is great also. many thanks to julie for her graciousness and friendship. i am your friend always,/ sharon
