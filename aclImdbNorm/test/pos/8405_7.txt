overall, i enjoyed the movie scarlett. i am a huge fan of gone with the wind. i have read the book and seen the classic movie many times. i even have a small collection of scarlett o'hara ornaments and other things. i must admit that gone with the wind is my all-time favourite book and movie. vivian leigh and clark gable are remarkable actors and two of my favourites. unfortunately, i was unable to read the book scarlett, but i was excited to see the movie. truth be told, the movie is not any where close to the calibre of gone with the wind and neither are the actors. however, joan whalley kilmer and timothy dalton were pleasant actors in the roles and at many times joan sounded like vivian leigh in her portrayal of scarlett. dalton also portrayed rhett well at times. it took some time getting used to the different actors, but overall i really enjoyed it ,being the fan of gone with the wind as i am. one major disappointment was that joan did not have green eyes and scarlett o'hara and vivian leigh both did. i also found the lord fenton absolutely appalling and i did not like his character. if you are a gone with the wind fan and/or enjoy romantic stories, see the movie scarlett. however, do not expect it to be remarkable like gone with the wind. it is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on. i am happy it is not a remake and some of the events in the story was what i imagined the continuation to be of the scarlett o'hara and rhett butler love story. if you haven't seen it today, get it tomorrow
