eisenstein's first sound film retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the russians under alexander nevsky defeated the livonian knights, eager to bring russia under roman catholicism. made in 1938, nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the nazis. the butchery by the knights when they enter a russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of world war ii. the film ends with a warning: those who came to russia with the sword will die by the sword. made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked eisenstein's return to official favor. by the late 1920s, stalin wanted soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the russian public. that stopped eisenstein's career in russia for a decade, and in nevsky he came back with his more accessible film. nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would be so vivid in the screen. another strong point is prokofiev's beautiful, haunting soundtrack (using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time). one of its weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simpleton russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful russian peasant) is really jarring.
