this movie tries to run away to the typical 'i'm fighting because i'm obliged to defend the fatherland. the nazi's are all bad guys, i'm against them' (typical of german war movies). how? by not talking too much about it, and just referring the war and the pow's. nevertheless i would like to see a german movie which would be something between the extremity of come and see and the "bad nazi's" das boot. i say this because, excluding this factor, the german movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the german side. you easily see some of the german hierarchical relations, very different from the ones in us army.<br /><br />this is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was stalingrad, and i was not there, and i doubt most people were there now, but if i would choose one movie depicting this battle, for sure would not be the all american enemy at the gates. why do i say this? because even the best soldiers are not hero's, and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland. this goes for all the ranks, and in the end you see von paulus giving the example.
