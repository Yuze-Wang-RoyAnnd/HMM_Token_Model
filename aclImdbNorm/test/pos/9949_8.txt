i remember running home from school almost every day to catch ktla's channel 5 monster movies, but never did i run home faster then when this movie was scheduled. somehow, the idea of being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend appealed to me in a very unique way. sure, i pretended to be spiderman, batman and other superheros, but i really wanted to be johnny sakko over any of them. <br /><br />i have not seen this movie in 30 years and i can still remember it vividly. who can forget the way giant robot shot missiles out of his fingers! or how about the way ghuillotene threw his fingernails to make explosions! geez, i can even still whistle the theme music that plays at the end, which is so tragic that i remember crying myself to sleep a number of times!<br /><br />only one other movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and that is the wizard of oz. but i have seen that movie many times since i was a kid. of course, the wizard of oz is a true classic whereas voyage into space is low budget nonsense. these two films shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence but to a young boy it isn't high production values or continuity that capture your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots!<br /><br />p.s. my cousin use to do a very accurate impression of giant robot (he pronounced it "giant robutt.") if you recall, giant robot had a particular way of shooting his missiles and my cousin had it down cold. i made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal amusement.
