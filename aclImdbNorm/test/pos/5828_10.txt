yes, this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the plot lines became over the top, melodramatic and very unrealistic, however, it didn't matter because the show is great. you really get involved in the characters and every character, no matter how minor or major, is perfectly cast.<br /><br />i can't imagine anyone else except jk simmons play the neo-nazi racist rapist leader, nor anyone else playing tobias beecher except lee tergesen. the transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing. however, the character that made oz oz was chris keller (played by christopher meloni). he didn't have relations with anyone else in prison except beecher (well, except ronnie barlog, but that was only to get ronnie to stop playing around with keller's lover boy, beecher). their relationship transcended sexes and tom fontana actually made us care about those two and want those two to be together.<br /><br />i loved vern's soft spot for his kids in the show and how fontana made sympathetic characters out of all these heinous criminals that we grew to adore, even simon adebesi. <br /><br />however, some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic: * a guy building a bomb in oz * guys standing in a spotlight in their windows in their pods looking at other men plotting something in their mind - too over the top. * drugs getting in oz * everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and sister pete never helped anyone in six years. * people getting killed in the gym, supply closet and kitchen. * no one hurting ryan's mom * no one fighting cyril outside the boxing ring (except vern of course) * two inmates with tools being left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dying with no investigation. * karl metzger (guard) gets killed and no one investigates. * governor holds all his press conferences at the prison * all an inmate needs to do is say "i want to see glenn" or "i want to see mcmanus" and they are taken to them no questions asked. * people die every week in oz * on the outside, people kill someone and get 20 years, up for parole in eight, but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately * there is no on site paid staff in the kitchen or mail room - inmates run both departments no questions asked * aging drugs for inmates to substitute as time served * ryan has no friends or associates but he never gets hurt, killed, maimed, raped or beaten. * the guys never flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw up. * an nba scout comes to the prison to recruit for an nba player (yeah right)<br /><br />however, with all these flaws, this show is still awesome. it's gruesome, brutal, sexy, edgy, raw and innovative. dean winters, scott william winters, jk simmons, christopher meloni, luiz guzman, adele (the guy that played simon adebisi), eammon walker, lee tergesen, terry kinney, mums, male alexander, ll cool j, etc, etc, etc. all are awesome and made the show worth watching. <br /><br />i highly recommend renting this on dvd. season six comes out 9/06 (next month). first five seasons are on dvd - watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary. i loved the director's commentary with chazz palmentari. the sequence with andy schillinger running down the cafeteria tables and then falling into the hole was an awesome, top notch shot!!!! kudos! and kathy bates directing family business and the famous wrestling scene between beecher and keller - simply amazing!! brilliant!!! that'd have to be so weird for meloni to touch tergesen's private part in front of an icon like kathy bates in that one scene!! wow! pulled that off beautifully, pun intended!<br /><br />i'm waiting for oz: the next generation!!!! (like with star trek, etc.) c'mon!!! let's get it started!!!!
