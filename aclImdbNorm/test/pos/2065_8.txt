not a box office success; no-one really knows why. it may have failed simply because of its title. it looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - "die hard", "lethal weapon", "hard weapon", "die lethal", etc. - talking about "the long kiss goodnight" will get you nowhere. but for once renny harlin has made a good action movie. a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, samantha, earns our affection and interest early on. as she becomes charly again, we're torn: we certainly want charly to thwart the bad guys, and all that; but we don't want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so - even though we like charly, too. geena davis bestows all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character. samuel l. jackson plays second fiddle for a change. it turns out he's good at it. that was a compliment.<br /><br />intelligent, far superior to anything in the "die hard" series - if i were more cynical i'd add, "it's not surprising that it didn't do well", but i don't really feel that way; it is surprising that it didn't do well.
