simon wests pg-13 thriller about a babysitter who gets disturbing prank calls while sitting at a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good film. although there are some elements of suspense, good eye candy and decent characters, the film is just another i know what you did last summer, as it falls short of being taken seriously. the performances were alright, but nothing special with this flick, i say skip it, unless you are looking for a mediocre movie, you can find better films than this on lifetime sometimes, okay maybe not lifetime but at least usa or somethin, haha.... <br /><br />7/10
