i loved this movie. my daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. there are not any movies for young children. i loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said "stupid". i applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie. i rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. my daughter can not stop talking about it. it goes along with our lifestyle. we live in east texas. i hope to see more family films like this one. she even named one of our calves "hokey pokey keen"!!! i can not say enough about this movie. i look forward to many more films like this one.
