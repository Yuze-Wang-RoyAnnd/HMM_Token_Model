i must say i thought the show greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. since i am part of a sorority i didn't want them to make greek organizations look bad....<br /><br />but i think greek is hilarious. yes, they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor.<br /><br />all the characters are pretty likable minus rebecca logan (i just can't stand her), casey and rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. then there is cappie. who doesn't love a guy like cappie haha his character brings so much to the show. rusty's room mate, dale played by clark duke, is hilarious as well.<br /><br />it's definitely fun to watch so tune in for season 2. i can't wait till it is back on!!
