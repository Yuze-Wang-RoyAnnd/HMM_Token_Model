it is depressing that many people don't understand this movie. to get caught up in the peripheral elements is to miss the true meaning of this film. this film speaks to the minority of people who actually believe in love and truth. it points out that in todays society too often people say what sounds good at the moment with no intention of backing things up when things get rough. as someone else stated that is evident in the number of divorces. some people actually believe marriage is forever. forget about stereotypes or anything else, but rather focus on what is important following your heart and fighting for who you believe in. i liked the ending because it would have been easy to go with a sappy one but came instead with the reality that committent is great, and you should fight with everything you have, but sometimes that still isn't enough. too often people just give up and forget about the magic of love. late.
