after learning that her sister susan is contemplating divorce, kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. when kate arrives, however, susan is nowhere in sight. that's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. as a storm rages outside, kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! in her first post-bewitched vehicle, elizabeth montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance. merwin gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by mcknight malmar. malmar's tale was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of boris karloff's thriller anthology series. thriller stuck very closely to the story, which is kind of a pity, for it could have used a little punching up. granted malmar wrote a moderately creepy number, but gerard (creator of the one step beyond show) adds several clever ingredients that heighten the tension and suspense.
