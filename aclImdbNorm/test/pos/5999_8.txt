swift's socialism and pacifism come through against all odds in this well done remake. (did you know there is no hyphen after "well"? fact.) he meets warlike miniatures, socialist giants, head-in-the-clouds (literally) philosophers, and pacifist horses who rule over yahoos -- nearly neanderthal humanoids. (is that where "yahoo" came from?) we also meet the dastardly dr. bates, the devoted mary gulliver, the sweet and devoted son thomas, and the full cast of a truly horrific 19th century lunatic asylum. suspension of disbelief comes easily, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and i did. (sorry for the length, imdb requires 10 lines.)
