this is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. bette midler comes as close to real magic on screen as anyone has in her turn as gypsy lee's blustery, bosomy, brave and very scary mother. she evokes a sense of desperation that is at times both comic and tragic but always genuine and quite beautiful. such charm and grit she is indeed a pioneer woman without a frontier. that frontier is discovered for the children. who in turn must forge their own in a world ruled by their domineering mother.<br /><br />this particular version is, as i understand it, in it's entirety including the brilliant choreography of jerome robbins, as well as the original stage directions.
