i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could. the writers were "smack on" and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.these characters were so real. one could tell that from the two main actresses ms. toussaint & ms. potts that their relationship on & off camera was genuine it didn't just end when you hear those familiar words "cut" at the end of a "take". the show has thought me a lot about life for e.g. historical struggles, tragedies and triumphs,relationships,every day situations, every household have same situations no matter who the members are, it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of every episode, you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself "now what did i learn from this particular episode".<br /><br />i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.<br /><br />now you know why i gave it a 10+!!
