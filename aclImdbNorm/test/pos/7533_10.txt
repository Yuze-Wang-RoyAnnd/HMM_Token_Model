"nagisa no shindobaddo" or "like grains of sand" is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are. this movie isn't about homosexuality, but it is about sexuality.<br /><br />aihara, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl. does she love yoshida? or does she love ito? or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the "incident"? (i doubt it).<br /><br />and what about yoshida? does he realize that he loves ito in the end? well, we all know he loves him as a friend. but you'll never know once you see this movie... haha :) in the end, aihara (along with ito) delivers an exceptional message to the audience: which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl. and i have to tell you, i'm so dense that i didn't get it at first. ^^;; it's because of the whole no talking scenes... you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say (especially the final part... whew, boy, that was confusing!) it's a confusing story, but it is beautiful nonetheless. :) this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen (and trust me, i've seen plenty).
