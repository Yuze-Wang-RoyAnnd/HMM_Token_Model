ed (coincidentally an editor) is hired to cut horror films down to be favorable in europe (where standards are much more rigorous). but he finds the films very mind-destroying and starts going a little bit mad. okay, "a little bit" might be an understatement.<br /><br />let me just say this first of all: best. opening. scene. ever. a man in an office who blows up his head with a grenade. his boss then says -- with a straight face -- "you're fired". the entire film does not keep up this level of intensity, but it certainly tries.<br /><br />take the shotgun scenes, the decapitation, the clips from "lost limbs" (which my friend jason wishes were a real film). the writer of this film thought up the idea of a woman who gets raped by a beaver and then immediately after gets shot in the face with a bazooka. that is something you won't find in any other movie (at least, i'm pretty doubtful you will).<br /><br />this film's biggest flaw is the quality. the picture isn't as crisp as a 1997 film should be, and the sound could be touched up (though it's not bad). i thought i was watching a 1980s film. although, that gave it a bit of a boost in my mind -- the film also had the 1980s style of writing and directing in it: a sense of fun and giving the audience a little something extra over the top. i do miss those days.<br /><br />i wish i had more to say, though at the moment i cannot think of anything strong enough to praise this film. i do think you ought to see this. you've seen the box in your video store with the ax splitting the head... maybe you've passed it up a few times. maybe you thought it would be cheesy. pick it up. savor it.
