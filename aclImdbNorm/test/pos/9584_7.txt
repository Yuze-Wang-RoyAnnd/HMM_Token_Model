ok, so i admit that it often seems like most of the sylvester/tweety pairings have exactly the same plot: sylvester tries to get tweety, but repeatedly fails and always gets maimed in the process, often with the help of a bulldog. i guess that it's sort of like wile e. coyote chasing road runner (in other words, mammals should never go after birds). "all a bir-r-r-rd" has the same plot and sets it on a train. in a way, the best part of these cartoons is seeing what sorts of schemes sylvester comes up with to try and go after tweety. we know that he's going to fail miserably, but it's also funny to watch tweety turn into a bad-ass (if you've seen his really early cartoons, you'll see that he was not "cute" at all, but in fact had a cruel streak). this one mainly works as a way to pass time.<br /><br />by the way, i thought that i saw - i mean, i taut i taw - sylvester pass a piece of baggage with the name friz freleng on it.
