an apt description by spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the enterprise. this was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first sulu & kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an earth of many centuries past. but he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on mccoy's medical tricorder. the officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like some bad cosmic penny, trelane keeps popping up. he brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. the dilemma now takes on elements of 'the most dangerous game' out in space and there's an exasperating, even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power.<br /><br />what really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. his character is obviously an early version of q, who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the tng series. trelane's confrontation scene with spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. as usual, kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outmatched. the answers to exactly what or who trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so, when we do learn the truth, it makes complete sense in view of campbell's pitch-perfect acting. he indulges himself constantly, preening before some unknown audience, remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down at first, but there's something missing here. every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. in a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. actor john de lancie captured that similar tone as q on the next generation series.
