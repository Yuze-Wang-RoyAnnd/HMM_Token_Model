i first played this around 98' or 99' when i was with my friends.i thought the game was really great,and loved it.<br /><br />the game is simple.on one player mode,you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic wasteland or a city.my favorite was one with a tank.on two player mode,you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight.through out the area you are in,you will find ammo and weapons to help.from hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work.<br /><br />again with player two mode,there are lots of places to go,and some to unlock.i find this game really fun,but also very suspenseful.because,you never really know where your opponent is,and it's surprising to see them behind a door where you are going.<br /><br />this game gets ****(1/2) stars or of ***** very good!go play it sometime!
