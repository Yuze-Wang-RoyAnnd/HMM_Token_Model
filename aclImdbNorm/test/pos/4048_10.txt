i have probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. every time, i get more and more impressed by how far the wish of a young heart can go, and the strenght of both kai and gertha to struggle for what they believe in.<br /><br />and the whole story is presented in such a way, you just get transfered into the plot and before you know it, you are there. you can see... yeah, there's kai... working hard on the mirror... a little jump.... there's gertha, fighting for her love..... and there's the snow queen...<br /><br />it's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, tension.<br /><br />it's brilliant 10 out of 10
