i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great. it's an adult entertainment, full of issues that a grown person can relate to. the acting is superb. it's fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle-aged couple. who knows how much of it came from their own marriage? susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character, aretha. raul julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd. the scenery in greece is spectacular; the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center. fantastic score by stomu yamashta. with so many things going for it, why isn't this a great film? it's a bit rambling and overly long, unfocused, and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama. still, it's engaging, entertaining, and deeply thoughtful.
