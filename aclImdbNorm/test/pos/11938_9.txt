this is one of those movies that are very underrated. again i am voting for an underrated movie. this movie has a good story line, maybe a bit farfetched but it could happen. sean astin(one of my favorite actors) again shows us a good performance. the guy does a great job in acting but never gets recognized for his roles. he has done well since the goonies. not only him but louis gosset jr. does a swell job. i thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters but who cares about money anyways. all around this is a good movie that will have you at the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving itself. i enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you will as well.
