of all the seasons and episodes of the twilight zone, after seeing all the great, mind boggling, thought provoking stories, this one stands on top. that's right. this story, this one entitled the hunt tops the large number of the finest scripts in television history.<br /><br />true, there are no interplanetary space flights, no inexplicable cracks in time. there is no living nightmare, no sudden changes of setting. there is seemingly nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist to deal with.<br /><br />the main character, played by veteran character actor arthur hunnicut, sets out from his cabin in the hills, accompanied by his faithful hound, to hunt raccoon. because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is by moonlight.<br /><br />the man and dog soon encounter a large raccoon, who hops on the dog's back and attempts to drown the hound in a pond. the man jumps in to help his dog. there is a sort of almost black-out, after which the pair are seen on the shore, in a lying, almost sleep like position.<br /><br />calling his dog by name, (rip, i think) the old man sets off to return home. when he arrives, he finds the wife weeping and unresponsive to his conversation. he also observes visitors coming and going to his house, paying respects and giving words to console his wife.<br /><br />still seeming puzzled at the strange reception and goings on around the home cabin, the man and rip take off on a long walk down the road, where he remarks out loud that he did not remember such a long fence in these parts. he eventually comes upon a rather large fellow, dressed in garb similar to his-overalls, hat, work shirt. they are at a gate, which leads to an area where a lot of smoke is freely rising up. the gate keeper is overly eager in his persuasive pitch in trying to get the man to enter. rip sounds displeasure. the gate man tells the old man that he may enter, but the dog would have to remain outside, offering to watch the animal for him. the man will have none of it and the two continue on their way down the path.<br /><br />after a little more hiking they come upon a second gated entrance where the gate keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him. when the old man reports what has happened down the road, telling him of how the guy at the other gate tried to separate the man and dog, and added, "with no dogs allowed, that must be a hell of a place!" the 2nd gate keeper stated that he was right! "that's exactly what it is!" <br /><br />our family had lost our 1st dog, lady-a mixed lab, in october of 1981. about 6 months later, as good fortune would have it, the wife(deanna) and myself along with our 2 daughters (jennifer 9 and michelle 6) viewed this episode on tv, wgn tv, channel 9 chicago. well, it all made perfect sense to us at that time.<br /><br />we're certain that anyone who has had that relationship with a family dog, would agree. the episode still brings a condition of watery eyes to this now 60 year old writer.
