i saw this film some years ago and promptly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent. bacharach's music is endearing and should be given the recognition it richly deserves. the cinematography is awesome. critics hated it, but they hated home alone too. i haven't found it on video but welcome anyone who can find a copy.
