this movie is quite better than the first one "ast'erix et obelix contre c'esar", but it is far away from perfection. the adaptation of the comic book is good, some of the pictures and the dialogs of the movie are the same as in the book. but there's few things that made the movie not as interresting as the animated movie released in 1968. for example the fighting between numerobis and amonbofis. this wasn't necessary or even credible, either for the little love story of ast'erix. there were also some stuff missing, like the songs that are in the animated movie, and some other things... i am deceived by the movie because they cutted in the stuff i was expecting tho see and they showed things that i did not wanted or needed to see. i know that it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same than the comic book or the animated movie, but that's what i expected. in conclusion, even if the movie is good, i still prefer the animated movie, wich is in my opinion, far better.
