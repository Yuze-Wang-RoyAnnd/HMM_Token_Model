when in 1982, "the thing" came out to theaters everywhere, it had a cold reception and very poor box-office results, becoming almost a failure in john carpenter's career as a horror director; however, time has proved that "the thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film's fault. nowadays, john carpenter's "the thing" has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without a reason, as this new version of john w. campbell, jr.'s story "who goes there?" (previously adapted as "the thing from another world") is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia.<br /><br />the plot of "the thing", begins in the winter of 1982 in a u.s. research station located in the remote territories of antarctica, when the members of the crew notice a norwegian helicopter coming their way. the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a husky dog who makes its way into the american base. after the norwegians are killed accidentally, the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane. soon they'll discover that the husky dog the norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog, but a creature able to mimic every living creature, and not only that, it has a tremendous hunger.<br /><br />director john carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher "halloween", where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock. "the thing" could be seen as an evolution of that style, as even when carpenter makes great use of rob bottin's special effects (which were labeled by critics as "repulsive" on its day), the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent (and very well-done) displays of gore. the feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing, even our main character, r. j. macready (kurt russell), ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted.<br /><br />this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not completely a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel. bill lancaster's script handles the characters with brilliant domain, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to completely trust them, making them an essential factor in the film's haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie. the mystery and the suspense are at the max, as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal, enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results.<br /><br />the cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real. carpenter's regular collaborator kurt russell as macready carries the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse. definitely one of his best performances. wilford brimley is also terrific as dr. blair, a scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing's purposes.<br /><br />"the thing" is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, although they exist. the most notorious being the very low-key and at times unappropriated score by ennio morricone. it's not exactly bad, but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it's not one of the best works by the legendary composer. also, due to some misshapes with the special effects, some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes, although nothing of big importance or actually annoying.<br /><br />when talking about john carpenter's films, most people will almost instantly name "halloween" as his favorite film, but personally, i would go with "the thing", as i consider it carpenter's greatest achievement so far, and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made. i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made. 10/10
