i am a huge rupert everett fan. i adore kathy bates so when i saw it available i decided to check it out. the synopsis didn't really tell you much. in parts it was silly , touching and in others some parts were down right hysterical.<br /><br />any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small identifying traits with the main character. (of course there are many they won't, but that is the point)<br /><br />if you like any of the actors give it a watch but don't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun.<br /><br />i might also mention you can see how darn tall rupert is. i mean i knew he was 6'4" but he seems even more in this film. he even seemed to stoop a bit due to the other characters height in this. he is tall! i mean tall!!!! and for you rupert fans there is a bare chest scene...wonderful!
