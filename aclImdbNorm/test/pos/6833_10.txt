surprised to know that the director (sebastian gutierrez) was a young venezuelan (28) and bored with so many predictable movies, i was delighted with the script showing so many small stories and cues spread here and there. directed with black humor and taste, i loved the tension between the very boggart rickman and the very natural but beautiful thompson. each member of the gang deserves attention, gil bellows at his best.gugino is remarkable.
