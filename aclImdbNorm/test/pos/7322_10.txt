this is one particular stooge short that actually uses satire in conjunction with slapstick, a rarity. as mentioned, the title and concept for this short was "borrowed" from a feature film from the same year with clark gable called "men in white". it's basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for "duty and humanity". i saw this recently and almost treated it like the stooge version because it does take itself a little too seriously. in any case, "men in black" is so well written, directed and not to mention original, it didn't borrow a thing from chaplin or any of the others, that the motion picture academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934. some stinky short called "la cucaracha" outdid it though and stole the award. some producer's brother in law must have been on the academy's voting board. "men in black" pokes fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the marx bros. always did at this time. may not be a fair comparison but i can see the marx bros. in this short. in fact in their feature "a day at the races", there is a scene where there's "medical things" going on and they cause anarchy as usual. my guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place. try this in fact: watch this short first and then watch "duck soup" or "day at the races" with the marxes and then see if there isn't the same great quality of comedy.
