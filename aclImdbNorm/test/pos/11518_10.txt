lights of new york was the first "all-taking" feature film, coming in at a brisk 57 minutes and directed by bryan foy (of the famous vaudeville family).<br /><br />the story has two dopey barbers (cullen landis, eugene palette) yearning for a chance at "big city life" and getting involved with gangsters and bootleg booze. one of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is saved at the last minute by a gun moll (gladys brockwell).<br /><br />much of the story takes place in a night club called the night hawk, which is run by a crook named hawk (wheeler oakman) who has his eye on a pretty chorine (helene costello) who is the girl friend of landis. costello gets to do a brief dance, and we hear harry downing (made up to resemble ted lewis) sing "at dawning) in his best al jolson style.<br /><br />the acting ranges from good (palette and brockwell) to awful (oakman). a couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene. as noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2-reeler and was made on a shoestring budget. yet the sound quality is surprisingly good, the voices all register clearly, and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette death.<br /><br />the film was a box-office smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not wired for the new sound technology. no one expected this little film to gross an amazing $1.3 million. it briefly made stars of costello and landis and certainly launched palette on his long career as a star character actor.<br /><br />co-stars include mary carr as the mother, robert elliott as the detective, eddie kane as the street cop, and tom dugan as a thug.
