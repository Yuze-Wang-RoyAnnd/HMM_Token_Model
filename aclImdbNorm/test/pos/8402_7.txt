i am a huge gone with the wind fan, and i read "scarlett" before it was a miniseries and loved it. this is a sequel of sorts. like you didn't expect it with that "frankly dear, i don't give a damn" ending. timothy dalton was great as rhett, though no one will ever replace clark gable. joann whaley-kilmer, on the other hand, could give vivien leigh a run for her money (though i feel almost guilty even saying that.) her attitude and presence in the film fits the character to a tee, making you love and hate her at the same time, which is how most feel about ms. leigh's portrayal as well. the film does move slowly, mostly because it follows the book so closely and was not released as a feature film. excellent choice on the producer's part. i think this movie deserves some recognition for the great storyline, the revival of characters that had been gone for almost 50 years, and for being something that even margaret mitchell herself could have been proud of.
