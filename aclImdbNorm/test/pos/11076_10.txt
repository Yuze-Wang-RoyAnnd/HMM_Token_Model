i just wanted to inform anyone who may be interested that the the movie "new jersey drive" was my personal favorite off alltime. i admire the work nick gomez and spike lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. this movie made quite an impression on me because of its realness and its appreciation of detail of life in urban new jersey. it struck a chord with me, personally, because i grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie. it further made an impression with me because i used to spend time in teaneck several years ago, so some of the characters were kept "real". at times, this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know whether or not these were real events taking place. although movies like "boys in the hood" and "menace ii society" grab more attention, i personally feel these movies were somewhat "enhanced" to appeal to a broader audience. "new jersey drive" was an uncompromising piece of "in your face" reality. lee and gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music, clothing, slang, and location.unlike some of the movies i mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they weren't "actors". nothing was compromised in order to make good "theater". the only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people "slept" on it. i look forward to more works of art from nick and spike in the hopefully near future.
