the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! <br /><br />one of the most hilarious three stooges shorts is men in black. in this short are bud jamison, jeanie roberts, phyllis crane, dell henderson, 'little billy' rhodes, billy gilbert, and ruth hiatt the acting by these actors are good especially by jamison and roberts. there are many funny scenes here that i think most three stooges fans will love! in my opinion this one of the most different three stooges shorts. i recommend this one to all!
