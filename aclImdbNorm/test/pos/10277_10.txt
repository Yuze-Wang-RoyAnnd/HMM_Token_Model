this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of.it's all about the obsessive love 5 people have for eachother in paris, (un)lucky coincidences, false identities.the music makes it really gripping.there are hardly any flaws in the characters,just the end is not very credible,but a definite "must-see" still.
