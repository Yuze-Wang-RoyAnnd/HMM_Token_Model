the comments of the previous user are harsh indeed. one wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet film. as for being so nasty about it in front of the writer/director..well thats just plain rude! for those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artful piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced. irish film-making sure has a lot of bitter angry people involved with it and the spleen venting comment made about this is evidence of it.. as people we have a choice; give out and moan about the people who actually go out there and make stuff or make something yourself.. i know which one is easier... do yourself a favour and watch this film and see how a short film is made... you won't be disappointed
