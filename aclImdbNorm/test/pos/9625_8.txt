this is my favourite kung fu movie. it has a very authentic flavour, seasoned by an eerie music score (of tradition chinese instruments, i think), and some wonderfully over-acted melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily affected comedy. indeed, while attempting to create their own "western" (i.e. cowboy film) genre, the chinese concocted a whole new animal, marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects.<br /><br />the story of five fingers of death is simple, a story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the "iron-fist-technique" that will enable him to wreak holy vengeance on his enemies. there is even a love interest, though the awkward, polite kind (found in most chinese films of the period). the end result however is great and much more authentic than any bruce lee movie.
