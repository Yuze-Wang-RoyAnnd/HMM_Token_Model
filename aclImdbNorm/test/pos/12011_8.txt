i think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the east german regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti-fascist protective wall. it is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed. i would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape. it did not happen in or around berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the berlin wall. the escape balloon was flown over the iron curtain which not only divided germany but it divided the whole of europe at that time. the balloon took off from p"ossneck, 170 miles south-west of berlin in the german democratic republic (east germany) and flew 14 miles to naila in bavaria and freedom in west germany. the opening of the iron curtain in hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the berlin wall later that year. whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema, it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from east berlin, other parts of the gdr or other soviet-controlled states.
