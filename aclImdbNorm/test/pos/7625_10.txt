once a wise man from india once said, "first they will laugh at us. then they will hate us. then they will fear us." know that yes this film's budget was a bit off, but even then with its story still takes our interest many yrs later, regardless of how it may have looked. but know soon, in due time "masten thrust" will arise to the big screen once again. then he and the new redesigned t-rex will more then shock you. it will scare many for centuries to come!! this film is in current pre-production and will be nothing like anything you have ever seen before! <br /><br />this will be beyond thx format.....right into 4-dx format. <br /><br />"be afraid, be very afraid!"
