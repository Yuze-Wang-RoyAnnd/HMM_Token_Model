such an awesome movie -- i was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end! the two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and i thought the comparison/contrast between their respective home lives vs. health situations were made so very real between them. the success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors, ep's, producers, writers, directors, and all of production i say, "well played!" having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was being shown on hbo), i was so very surprised that i had to actually research (albeit briefly) the internet in order to find the title of this movie -- something so great should have been known by me -- a clear indication that this movie must be re-released!
