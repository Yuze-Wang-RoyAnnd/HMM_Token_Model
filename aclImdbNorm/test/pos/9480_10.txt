the first time i've seen this dvd, i was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything, but also because the dvd itself is extremely loud. jimmy page obviously can't live with quiet music, i guess. i do must say though that during the concert at royal albert hall, they expanded 'how many more times' and 'moby dick' too long. other than that, it was exquisit. my favorite song of all time is now on that dvd. trampled underfoot. it's either that one or 'in my time of dying'. in that song, jimmy really plays that thing good. ever seen randy rhoads play? well, jimmy plays just like him, except his guitar is lower.
