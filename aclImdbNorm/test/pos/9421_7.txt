basil rathbone and nigel bruce as sherlock holmes and dr. watson respectively, the second of the universal series, where it's again established by means of a written prologue that the famed detective is legendary and spans time. this helps to comfortably set things up here in the "present" era of the early 1940's.<br /><br />in this offering, holmes goes through a few different disguises (with rathbone's very prominent features, is it likely that people really wouldn't recognize his true identity?) as he protects a physicist from the hands of the nazis as well as from holmes' greatest nemesis professor moriarty (now played by lionel atwill). the scientist has developed a bomb sight which will greatly aid in aerial bombardment, and he's promised his plans to the british. but moriarty wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the nazis.<br /><br />a good entry boosted a bit by the participation of the properly villainous atwill now cast as moriarty (though george zucco was no slouch himself in the adventures of sherlock holmes). it's always intriguing watching holmes and his greatest enemy engaging in witty banter together ("the needle to the last, eh, holmes?").
