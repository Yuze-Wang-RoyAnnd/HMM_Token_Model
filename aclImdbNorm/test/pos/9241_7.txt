everyone who has ever wondered how to make a film on no budget should see this documentary. the determination of everybody portrayed in this project was very moving to me, and should connect to those of us who have ever ventured into any part of show business, be it film, music, or writing. i think the film makers could have done a better job with foreshadowing the events that led up to this film becoming a documentary, perhaps by use of a narrator; other than that, the film comes off as a real example of how show business isn't about "the show", but rather "the business".<br /><br />i hope that the actual intended project, "repo man ii", gets to see the light of day. i think the film makers did a fine job on it with what little they had to work with, and all that they had to overcome to complete it.
