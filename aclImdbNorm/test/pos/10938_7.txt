i enjoyed this movie okay, it just could have been so much better. i was expecting more action than what i got...which was more of a comedy than anything else. granted, it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. which is hard to do with a vampire movie. a vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another, his sister is going through a difficult break up, but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things. granted, this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood. so that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power. some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it, that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too. one minute action, the next pure comedy. however, the girls were cute, there is good action, the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and jackie chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two. this movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all. so for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good...though why was it rated r? i have seen stuff we have made that is pg-13 that is a lot worse than this.
