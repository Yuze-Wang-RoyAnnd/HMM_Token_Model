it is now clear that the true golden age of american film was from the mid-60s until just before the release of star wars. before then, there was too much hays code-constricted pap. with star wars, the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons, a practice which continues to this day. the seven-ups, truth be told, contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue -- "we can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way" is one -- but i'm damned if i can find anything else wrong with it. (in fact, that line may not even have been stale when this film was made.) the seven-ups demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age: sparse dialogue, realistic acting, real locations (winter in a dirty new york has never looked better/worse), propulsive stories, and, yes, the best car chase ever filmed. bill hickman is the driver scheider is chasing (you will recognize him from bullitt), and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the mcqueen one, but i prefer scheider's facial intensity here, the pacing, the terrific close-ups of the schoolchildren, and the shattering conclusion. (that vw bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the bullitt chase.) a stringy, screechy score by don ellis sets the perfect mood. the seven ups: bleak, grim, action-oriented, grown-up. this is a film that couldn't be made today; there's no "gimmick" for the kiddies or preposterous ending. thank you, philip d'antoni, roy scheider and tony lo bianco: for as long as cop films are watched, the seven-ups and its 1970s brethren (e.g., the french connection), will set the standard.
