this mini-series is iconic of the australian spirit. while there may be what are perhaps considered glaring inconsistencies, the film portrays a spirit that is unique to australia, and one that should be cherished. if anything, this mini-series demonstrates the aussie sense of humour. the ability to laugh at the supremely ridiculous. our willingness to have a laugh in even the most dire of situations. while a large part of this series focuses on mateship and how humour can be used as a means of survival, it also has elements of drama that are evoke real emotions. the main actors who appear are absolutely sensational and very convincing in their different roles. capturing the essence of their characters perfectly. this mini-series should be mandatory viewing for all australians.
