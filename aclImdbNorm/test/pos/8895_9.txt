for those who have enjoyed the asterix books and films, you'll love this film! yes, i will admit that it does mix some of the books and films, but the characters are brilliant and it's not just people showing off their cgi left, right and centre. i've already seen it several times and laughed my socks off at it.<br /><br />of course it contains the main heroes asterix (ast'erix), obelix (ob'elix) and dogmatix (id'efix), but this time they have someone new to... deal with.<br /><br />with a sense of humour like that, the gauls will go on and on and on. bless 'em.
