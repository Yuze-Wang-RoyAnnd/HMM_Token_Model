"alexander nevsky" marked director sergei eisenstein's return to film-making after a period of exile, and what he produced is a bald-faced propaganda film proclaiming russia's superiority over germany.<br /><br />there's very little plot: russians unite to battle germans; russia wins. the film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed in with some moments of german brutality (like a rather shocking scene that shows german soldiers throwing russian children onto a raging fire). this was eisenstein's first sound film, and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. indeed, this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added. there are some dialogue scenes, but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen, and the pacing is all off, as if the actors weren't actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them. eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing prokofiev score over the proceedings, and indeed, that's one of the film's biggest assets.<br /><br />say what you will about eisenstein's ability (or lack of) to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect, and "alexander nevsky" over all shines through its deficiencies.<br /><br />grade: a
