"five fingers of death" is a classic of 70's kung fu cinema. as the film that "broke out" hk cinema to the west, this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre. it's also a damn entertaining film, with hard-hitting, non-stop action, solid and mostly believable fight choreography and great over-the-top 70's era dubbing ("oh i see ... so you want it the hard way!! hwaa!!").<br /><br />"five fingers" is an eye-for-an-eye revenge tale ... and i mean literally, eye for an eye! it's great to see lo lieh portraying a hero. he played so many great villains later in his career - including pai mei in the classic fist of the white lotus, which was one of the characters tarantino used in creating the pai mei of kill bill.<br /><br />my only complaint is that i wish there was a better quality dvd - mine looks like it was a vhs transfer. overall this is a great film - don't miss it!<br /><br />bart blackstone film club - hollywood, ca
