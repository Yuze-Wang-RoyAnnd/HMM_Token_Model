i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie. i actually ran across this movie by accident. i was taping another movie on showtime one night, overnight and this movie came on afterward. so i sat and watched it and boy was i blown away. the acting is absolutely superb. kathy bates...who has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values (religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family. martin sheen is superb as the "tough" patriarch who is really not in control of anything in his life or family. the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home. it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain. this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen it. this is a must-see for anyone who wants a true drama, this is not too melodramatic and preachy, but pulls at your heartstrings like none other
