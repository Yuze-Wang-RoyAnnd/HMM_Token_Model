this movie exemplifies a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the troma movies (with which it shares certain qualities). the humour is rough and ready but fast and furious. if the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds don't make you shrug with boredom, reach for the six-pack of beer and enjoy the best "chucky" film yet.
