as an adult, i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen. during the time, i was experiencing familial problems. this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a closeted world. how much peer pressure is too much? i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience. how far might an individual go for social acceptance? who is the "bad" crowd? teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions, but ultimately...who is the "pack leader" if there must be one? is it the strong? the beautiful? perhaps the person we just all seem to like? could it be the moral character? as far as the movie goes, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me. i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more.
