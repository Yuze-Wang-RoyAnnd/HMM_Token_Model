the famous closeup of their breakfast meat, crawling with maggots still is recorded by fire in my neurons or the wind filling the right places of the sails, the fog better than carpenter's the fog cos is the real terror bursting out from human history instead of pirates ghosts. but , i tell ya' something: not even the magnificent scene in homenage performed by brian di palma with the excellent music of ennio morricone in the untochables (filmed in slow motion)can equal the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd climbing down the ladders. we see not merely the baby stroller but i remember the hand of a baby stepped by militar boot, someone with no feet escaping at the last minute, someone wearing glasses (then a cut edition) and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that passed through....mini stories in a single scene.
