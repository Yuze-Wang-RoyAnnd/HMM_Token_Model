this was on the saturday before halloween this year (today, at the time of this writing) and it has to be the best horror anthology out there. i am normally not a fan of horror movies - largely due to the volume of crap that's been recently released. however, the director of campfire tales has the hitchcock-esquire gift of suspense - unlike other contemporary films, it doesn't take every opportunity to scare you silly, instead using foreshadowing and 'near-misses' - incidents that seem like the instant that the climax will occur in the instant before, but turn out not to be.<br /><br />i didn't catch 'the hook' or the first main segment, but from what i have read here, they were the two you could afford to miss.<br /><br />'people can lick too' was full of suspense - this short keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders about her yard and house looking for her soccer ball and later her dog. she encounters so many near-misses that the suspense reaches heart-stopping proportions before the climax of the short, when the girl gives up and goes to bed, thinking her dog is underneath it. she reaches her hand down to let him lick it, and she feels the touch of a tongue on her hand...before noticing that on her mirror, written in blood, is 'people can lick too'. i'll leave the last few seconds for you to find out, my reader, for at this point the short could have taken any number of turns.<br /><br />'the locket', however, was the unarguable masterpiece of this film. it begins with a man on a motorcycle, simply driving...towards what he does not know, but he can feel himself getting closer. as he's driving along, a storm breaks out, and he's forced to find shelter in the house of a mute girl. the two quickly cozy up to each other, but before they can do anything besides kiss, the girl reveals through writing that ghosts inhabit her house. they quickly begin packing up to leave, but they are caught in the middle of a reenactment of a scene decades past - a father, coming home to his daughter and her boyfriend preparing to elope, murders the both of them and then commits suicide. i'll have to leave you to discover the ending here as well - i couldn't hope to do the story justice in any case, and what i've said so far is just a brief summary of the story - i couldn't hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that add to it.<br /><br />'the campfire', being the connecting thread between all of the stories, is a fairly interesting rehash of the car accident theme, and the girls are very much attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this film are good-looking. anyway, despite the fact that it's chopped up, the story is given justice, and the ending is difficult to predict if you're preoccupied with the other stories. however, if you pay enough attention to the segments of the campfire spread through the film, it's certainly possible to predict the ending, especially if you've seen movies based on the same premise. (mst3k fans, remember soultaker? same premise, but without the god awful writing of vivian schilling, and the bulk of the movie. if you've seen the first 30 minutes of that you should be able to predict the ending.) all in all, the best horror movie i've seen in a long time, and the only horror anthology worthy of a buy.
