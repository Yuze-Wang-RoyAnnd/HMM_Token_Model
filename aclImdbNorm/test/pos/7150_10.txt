i was surprised that " forgiving the franklins " did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival. there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie. the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues . you know little issues like religion, sex and the truth. lots of comedy's seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations, many leave you thinking " i know they ripped this off from some sitcom " .this film takes off on its own unique direction . i really think that jay floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film.
