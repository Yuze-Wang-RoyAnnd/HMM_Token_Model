i've been studying brazilian cinema since 2004, when i stumbled onto "cidade de deus / city of god". let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or better than "city of god".<br /><br />the acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. i have not been to brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of s~ao paulo.<br /><br />i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.<br /><br />something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on.
