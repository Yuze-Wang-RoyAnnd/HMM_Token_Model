krajobraz po bitwie like many films of wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the "rest of the world". story based on the few short stories of tadeusz borowski, who during wwii was the prisoner of oswiecim, dachau and dautmergen camps. borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. he describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. ironically, after the returning to poland he stopped writing artistic prose and became communistic propagandist, producing stream of anti-imperialistic and anti-american press publications. after few years he committed suicide. in the movie wajda changes point of view. vorarbeiter tadek - character created by the tadeusz janczar - plays only supporting role. story is focused on the poet, destroyed, burned out by the war and imprisonement and his one-day love affair with nina, jewish girl who escaped from communistic poland although she actually hates jewish life and mentality. as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so-called "dipis" (displaced persons) life, who after the liberation are settled by the americans in ss barracks. marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and/or prostituting german girls.<br /><br />
