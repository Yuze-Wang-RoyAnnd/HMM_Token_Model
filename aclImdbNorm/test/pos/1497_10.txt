star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />mr bean (rowan atkinson) is in this world, but not of this world. his mind simply doesn't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this, getting himself into constant mishaps and far out, zany situations, which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks. but he never gives up and, despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him, applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end.<br /><br />to look at the sorry state of modern british humour, with all it's focus of sex and general vulgarity, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time. there's nothing unsuitable going on here, just good, clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the 50s. and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as i did when i was a young boy in the early 90s.<br /><br />although i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye. there must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him. as others have noted, it looks like he may have a type of autism. in fact i'm so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him, i think mr bean could be the first famous, fictional character to be diagnosed with something like asperger's syndrome.<br /><br />if you'd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at it's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then this would come highly recommended. shows like little britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest. shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once, and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon. *****
