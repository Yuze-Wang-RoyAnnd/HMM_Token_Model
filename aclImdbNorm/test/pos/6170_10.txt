since growing up in czechoslovakia i was following history of raf pilots and crews in wwii great britain, their stories and tragic ending either in the combat or in communist prisons and camps. this is without any doubt more than dark chapter in our history, although the fact that those brave men we're able to go through all this and recover afterward is amazing. to all people who want to see great movie...this is the one! during recent visit of czech republic i saw this movie three times in three days (they we're just playing it for three days...otherwise i will go to see it even few more times!!! it's worth of it!) i hope you will enjoy it, although it requires a little more thinking and knowledge of background information behind the story, pretty much same way that the movie "kolya" was. it's not a simple movie because of it's deep story, and the way its told will most likely make you crying...it did to me three times in row... zdenek sverak did as always a great script, his son jan made a great movie and the cast? without doubt all of them did great job, i was amazed by ondrej vetchy, by great role played by oldrich kaiser and all other actors which made this movie simply great!!! if this is not an oscar nomination i think that i will be on strike in holywood.
