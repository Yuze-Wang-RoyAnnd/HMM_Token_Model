this epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to life that i find difficult to explain. to immerse oneself in die zweite heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. the language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. the film inspired me to go to munich and visit some of the locations, including the edgar reitz office. from then on, i vowed to improve my german skills - after die zweite heimat i feel almost german, as if i am in the head of the characters. i also try to match the piano playing of henry arnold (hermann), but this is the one thing that will always elude me ! this drama is unparalleled and i have been fortunate to see it on bbc2 in the uk and sbs in australia. the sequel, heimat 3, is currently being filmed in germany.
