i really liked this one. (spoilers??) it had a really good plot, the main female in this movie is really kewl.<br /><br />despite the fact that she's the only one left alive and her lover dead, it seemed to be much like ninja scroll. another kick ass movie. ;)<br /><br />watch it in japanese with subtitles. i don't know where the idiots who learned to speak english are, but for some reason all dubs get an f in translation techniques. the subtitles are more correct.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />quality: 7/10 entertainment: 10/10 replayable: 9/10
