burt kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel. kennedy was a well known good writer & director, mostly westerns.<br /><br />robert mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this. this role was like many he had made already,one can see why he was a big star for so many years.<br /><br />he filled this role easily like a well used glove.<br /><br />the title character is played by robert walker jr. (his father a fine actor robert walker--died tragically at age 32---his mother is noted actress jennifer jones).<br /><br />robert was of slight build & even though he had talent only made a few films. (he was in rita hayworth's near last film.<br /><br />road to salinas ---the same year & was very good).<br /><br />he looked very much like his father, but seemed to lack his fathers charm. he made only a few more movies. he is still living & i wish him well.<br /><br />most of his scenes are with another son of a hollywood great. john carradine's son david, who is still making movies. they made a nice team.<br /><br />in westerns you always have a female character & usually she is a dance hall performer. (today they call them hookers), angie dickinson assays this role nicely. also featured are western stalwarts, john anderson & jack kelly.<br /><br />it was film in old tucson )outside of downtown tucaon az,. & the scenery is gorgeous.<br /><br />typical of the older westerns, there is not too much action,there is some good humour & the usual ending shoot out.<br /><br />it is a fast enjoyable 89 minutes.<br /><br />ratings: *** (out of 10) 84 points(out of 100) imdb 7 (out of 10)
