"tourist trap" is an odd thriller that came out in the 70's, it's about 5 friends molly (jocelyn jones), jerry (jon van hess), eileen (robin sherwood), becky (tanya roberts) and woody (kevin mcdermott), who stumble upon a cloesd down museum slausen's lost oasis, a curious and eerie roadside museum. this goldmine of decaying, but strangely life-like mannequins is run by slausen (chuck conners), an eccentric, but seemingly harmless has-been. slausen has one warning for the youngsters: stay away from davey, slausen's reclusive and disturbed brother.<br /><br />the youngsters' curiosity gets the best of them and they go exploring. the trap is sprung! amidst flying objects, slamming doors, scarves that strangle on their own, empowered by some hidden force, the trap slowly closes in on the group. the "creature" davey and his army of murderous mannequins make quick and brutal work of the friends, until only one remains.<br /><br />although not a slasher movie "tourist trap" still contains elements of slasher movies such as the chase scenes and the stalking and the fact the killer wears a mask.<br /><br />the seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock bolts and animate the wax dummies, is used to great effect. perhaps the scariest thing about this movie are the mannequins, which are admittedly scary enough to start off with, but are rally spooky here. the film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget. these wax figures are blatantly plastic shop dummies- but this only goes to serve as even more eerie when their eyes move with an incredible human the acting is actually pretty good, chuck conners gives a well rounded and creepy performance as mr slausen, jocelyn jones is great as the female lead.
