i watched this series on tv in 1990 and absolutely loved it (i was nine years old). i bought the first dvd box about six month ago and got the second a couple of days ago (thanks to my dear husband). gosh...it was hard to get any sleep with all the thoughts in my head...what was gonna happen to madeline and george etc. slave issues and civil war has always fascinated me (a 25 year old finn).i advise to read slaves in the family by edward ball for those who want to take a peek in the past and try to understand what really happened.<br /><br />i'm not sure if i want to see heaven and hell after so many people have told here that it wasn't really that good.
