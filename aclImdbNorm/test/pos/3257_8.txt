this deceptively laid-back, low-key, casually paced aussie crime thriller unravels with a casual ease and relaxed self-confidence that's a delight to behold. eager beaver working class kid jimmy (an appealingly feckless heath ledger) yearns to make something out of his unrewarding ordinary life. jimmy gets his big break when local crime kingpin pando (an outstanding bryan brown) assigns him an easy courier gig which entails delivering $10 grand to an old lady. jimmy finds himself knee deep in serious trouble when he loses pando's money. writer/director gregor jordan's engagingly simple tale of how things aren't always what they're cracked up to be, young love, all actions having consequences and that hoary old chestnut about how crime doesn't pay works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well-observed minor quirky details, a strong subtext concerning man's duel capacity for both good and evil, a nice sense of unforced irony, the chillingly matter-of-fact way the violence is presented, and the marvelous grounding of the assorted complexly drawn warts'n'all low-life characters in an instantly recognizable and totally believable banal day-to-day reality (e.g., panda is shown playing scrabble with a flunky and at one point interrupts a business conversation with a fellow hood to talk with his son over the phone). judging from his finely shaded and two-fisted portrayal of the cunning, not to be trifled with pando, bryan brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the finest actors to ever grace celluloid. a sturdy and satisfying little sleeper.
