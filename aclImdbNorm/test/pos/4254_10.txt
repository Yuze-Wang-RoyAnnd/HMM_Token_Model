i saw this movie in its brief run in "art house" cinema in '69. i found it so funny that i literally spent part of the movie on the floor, having laughed so hard i fell out of my seat. in retrospect, years later, i thought it had been done by melvin van peebles. when i mentioned it to a friend, he said that a friend of his, downey sr., filled virtually every non-acting role in the flick: director, writer producer, etc. he was right of course, and my memory was wrong, except that this was one of the funnies movies ever made. the part of "the arab" was particularly priceless.
