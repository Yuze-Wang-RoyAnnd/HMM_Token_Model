michael sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a comic genius. if you are familiar with kenneth williams' mannerisms and diaries then this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. when i read about kenneth hoovering in his swimming trunks i laughed and then it was brought to life on the screen, but this time i didn't laugh as it was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man. it must have been such a lonely existence being in kenneth's skin, craving attention but shunning it when it truly mattered! the last 20 minutes are heart-breaking as you see kenneth gradually sink to the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative. i have seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he bids goodnight to louie. i cannot recommend this drama enough. sexually explicit but it drives home the fact that kenneth couldn't let anyone invade his world and this is where the sadness of the man lies. for a genius who brought happiness to so many, it's such a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. pauly.
