for a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million, this little movie that could deserves a 'best we could' award. interesting premise (aside from the usual meteor stuff) with solid perfs by a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. advice to the other reviewer: don't be afraid to say you liked something.
