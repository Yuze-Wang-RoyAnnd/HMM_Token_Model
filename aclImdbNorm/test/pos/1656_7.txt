"rififi" is a terrific heist movie, and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since. jules dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live---you will not find here the hollywood glamour of "ocean's eleven." the robbers in "rififi" don't rob for the thrill, and they're not playing a game. they rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. the much-lauded heist scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence. i did have the feeling that the plot went on a bit longer than it needed to, but the high-speed race to deliver the child to his mother that ends the film is classic.<br /><br />be warned---this movie is very bleak. but it's also very good.<br /><br />grade: a-
