one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time. bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint.<br /><br />this movie has you guessing throughout, and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen. there are no bad guys or good guys, bechard makes sure of that. the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them, you care about what they have been through.<br /><br />bechard's use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of "fast food movies" and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you love the feeling it gives you.<br /><br />i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell. thank you gorman bechard for proving that false.<br /><br />run, don't walk, to see this movie.
