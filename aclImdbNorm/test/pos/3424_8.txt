not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission, i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. i started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from bbc2 earlier this year) but once i'd started i had to watch to the end.<br /><br />the down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. like a good novel, i couldn't put it down. all the way through, i wished i was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice. what happened to its release in theatres? i'm an admirer of chiwetel ejiofor since i saw him in dirty pretty things, and hilary swank looks terrific in this - very female and sexy for a change (possibly out of place, but she adds to the visual attractiveness of the film).<br /><br />this picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting.
