this movie will send chills down your spine, even if you don't understand german. i first saw this in my german class in high school and found it for $5 at my local wal-mart. i've seen it at least 20 more times since *this being only a couple years ago* and it's great to watch on a movie night. the plasticized bodies are mostly real, used from body worlds. this movie was an out-lash to that. a german dr. *nicknamed dr. death* began plasticizing human bodies for display and now body worlds is a touring deal, right now in chicago il. many people were opposed to this and so a great german horror movie was made. i personally love this movie and would recommend it for all who like thriller slasher films.
