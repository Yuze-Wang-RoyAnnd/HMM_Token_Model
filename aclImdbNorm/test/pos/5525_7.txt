the title refers not to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic players. they come in twos: charles ruggles and mary boland as a couple driving to california for a second honeymoon, george burns and gracie allen as another couple who go along to share expenses, and w.c. fields and alison skipworth as a sheriff and a hotel-owner in a tiny nevada town. no attempt is made to fashion a coherent narrative
