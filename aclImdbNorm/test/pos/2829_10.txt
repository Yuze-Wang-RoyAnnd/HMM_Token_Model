and that's saying a lot. rent this if you want to be staggered by oddness, blown away by one of the most bizarre scripts, direction, and casting in the history of films. i'm staggered. i can't believe i watched it. i'm a big bernadette peters fan, normally- but this tested my resolve. don't read any more reviews here, it's best if you know nothing about the plot. just rent it. you won't believe what you're seeing.......
