this is a very well written movie full of suspense right up to the end! the setting is beautiful in contrast to the frightening action taking place there! it is not your typical suspense movie, but a movie well packed with interesting twists and surprises which leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel. i recommend this film to all suspense lovers!
