"hit and run" is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who "has it all" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. hence the title. the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns, but is frightened away by angry passers-by who think the hitter abandoned the scene. this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story.<br /><br />colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away. her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self-loathing hole, causing her to make a bad situation worse.<br /><br />this is a very thought-provoking story, and one can't help but to feel this lady's pain, wishing throughout that she would simply come clean.<br /><br />as a tv movie, thanks to colin and a strong script, this is a well above average tv movie.
