this one of those social dramas that wb knew how to put together and were guaranteed boxoffice hits in the thirties. this early "dead end kids" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. cagney, a gangster as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school. he doesn't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. the idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it's a movie. it's a lot like boys town with a slight darker tone. a useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good. wb would later make this same movies with bogart in the cagney/fatherly role.
