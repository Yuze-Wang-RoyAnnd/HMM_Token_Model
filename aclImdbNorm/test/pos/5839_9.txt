i can't stand people who comment on this program or other hbo programs as "too graphic" or "unnecessarily graphic" or that they contain "gratuitous nudity/violence/sodomy etc".<br /><br />guess what? prison life isn't pg-13. the "gratuitous" graphic content is true to life of this situation. prison contains inmate rape/killings/drug deals and showers. if you don't like it, then don't watch the program. i'm certainly no fan of prison rape, but if it was left out of the show i'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility. if the prisoners didn't curse, it would just be silly. sure it's gratuitous language, but that is realistic.<br /><br />the show is good, some of the viewers....not so much, i guess.
