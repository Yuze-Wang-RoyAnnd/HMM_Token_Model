i like this movie above all others. it is "multi-layered"; there is so much to see and appreciate. every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line, the plot and the characters. faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it. i love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. ralph fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by colin firth. the scene in the sand storm where catherine & el-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts. the other relationship between hanna & el-masy is yet another "layer" of the movie which is totally enchanting (and heart-rending). a worthy winner of so many awards.
