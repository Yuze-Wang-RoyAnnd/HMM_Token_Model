saw this film at the nft in london where it was showing as part of the bfi's john huston season. i wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away. in fact the rest of the film continued to give little away! no real plot, no action, no suspense, very little drama and, except for a short section at the very end, no scenery.<br /><br />the result of lack of all of these features was, however, a wonderful film. i don't fully understand why, but i think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect. the acting, script and, most important of all, the casting were all spot on and i can't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good, but i still can't work out why. i just know that i will be getting the dvd (this is one of those films that will, i am sure, be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience, provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it!) and i will be watching it again soon. i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it. i'm sure that it will not be everybody's choice but i am convinced that a large number will agree with my view.<br /><br />9 out of 10.
