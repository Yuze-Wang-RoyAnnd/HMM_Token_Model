this movie is brilliant.<br /><br />i don't remember this movie even being in theaters, so thinking it was a "straight to dvd" i have fairly low expectations, even though i am a big fan of mike judge. it has some of the same kind of comic future satire as "brazil" and "demolition man", but taken to the next level.<br /><br />then i saw the cast; luke wilson, maya rudolph and dax shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles.<br /><br />needless to say, this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes, where it shows above-average people having fewer children and the poorest, stupidest, trashiest people having lots of ignorant children, and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution. it takes that concept, and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool.<br /><br />sadly, i don't think it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably only about 50. i already see the shocking rise of "mild retardation" in the general populace, media and culture. people who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected. the lowest common denominator seems to rule, especially in hollywood and on tv (eg, "jackass the movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money).<br /><br />all of the political/social satire aside, this movie is also just laugh out loud funny! and i don't say that lightly; few movies make me actually "lol", but this one did.<br /><br />a lot of the best jokes are word/sight gags in the background, so you really have to pay attention to get some of them. i even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them (like when joe got his government id and for "hair" it said "yes" and for "eyes" it also said "yes"). also, the prison has engraved on the front "house for particular individuals", since the cops in the movie (much like real life cops) call everyone "individuals" instead of people, etc. again, this was on the screen for just a moment...this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny.<br /><br />also, i normally watch movies with the subtitles on, and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix, for instance, the police constantly talk about people "excaping" instead of "escaping", and there are many other mis-pronunciations that just cracked me up. but again, i might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with music/sound effects; it is very subtle but still hilarious.<br /><br />additionally, the special effects were really good for a sci-fi/social satire.<br /><br />i could go on and on, but overall, i think this is one of those movies that if you don't think it's funny, it's probably making fun of you! i plan on recommending this to many, many people!
