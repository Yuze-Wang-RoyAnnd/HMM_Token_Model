don't let the rating of 5.9 (as of this writing on 12-8-02) fool you, this is one excellent film.<br /><br />i cannot fathom how this got such a rating considering being so solid at all levels. the direction, acting, cinematography--all good. the story is interesting and original and my only inkling as far as understanding why the rating is such, sits in the fact that it is probably the type of movie that people rating might not normally see.<br /><br />i equate it to playing modern rock for an 80 year old. you might be young, brought up on it and love it, but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste--doesn't care for it.<br /><br />if you like films and can handle movies based more on real people versus those comprised of mindless action, enormous flashy budgets and mediocre talent, give this one a try next time you see it on...<br /><br />
