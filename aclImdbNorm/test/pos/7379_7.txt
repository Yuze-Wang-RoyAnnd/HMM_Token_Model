this was an interesting study in societal sexuality, as well as the "dark interests" of man.<br /><br />while i can't say the wife was a strong character - she was the wrong choice for the part, in my opinion - she was a rich kid in search of escaping her drool life. she was a rebel in fact, and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (rickman). it's obvious he married her for her money and to cover his sexual desires, which is taboo. rickman played his part to a tee, his flirtations with the young man, and very subtle undertones of gayness. the young man was gay to the hilt! when he did marilyn impersonation that should have told the wife everything. he was perfectly cast as well. he has hustler written all over him.<br /><br />i was not crazy about the ending, as i knew what was coming. overall though, the acting from rickman was great, reedus was good, walker was okay but i had misgivings. for a gay themed movie, it was average, but not blatant at least. it's worth viewing if you don't have "truly madly deeply" lying around for a spin.
