my family truly enjoyed this movie. as far as what this movie will do for rugby in the usa...well i am sure that will be debatable. but as for me and others around me, i know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and i personally gained more respect for the game. you may wonder how this possible, especially since the movie does not dive in and explain rugby. but the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life. the film was inspirational as well as entertaining. it made us laugh and cry. the chemistry between sean astin, big budah and sean faris worked well. some may think the movie is a little clich'e, but i seriously wish hollywood made more movies like this. i couldn't help drawing analogies of the game and life's struggles. at the end of it i found myself examining my own life to see what i needed to do better, in order to be the best person i could be. honestly i was grateful this movie taught morals, values and teamwork, there is so much to the contrary. after watching this i really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like coach gelwix.
