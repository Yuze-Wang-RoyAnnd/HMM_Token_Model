this gem captures early 80's life brilliantly. as a grad '83 boy<br /><br />myself, i must say that valley girl (along with fast times at<br /><br />ridgemont high )stands out as the class of the teen sex film<br /><br />genre. the characters are accurate representatives of the era; the<br /><br />vapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are all<br /><br />represented here.<br /><br />i have seen this over ten times now. the music in the film was top<br /><br />notch. unfortunately, these tunes could were never as popular in<br /><br />their era as those by arena cockrockers like journey, styx or<br /><br />loverboy. before the soundtrack existed, i searched out records<br /><br />and tapes (it was the 80's after all !) of josie cotton, sparks,<br /><br />plimsouls and modern english.<br /><br />this movie deserves respect. it isn't just a good 80's teen flick. it is<br /><br />a great film. period.
