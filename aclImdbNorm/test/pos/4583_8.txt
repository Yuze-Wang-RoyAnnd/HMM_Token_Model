this must be the dumbest movie i've ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award. ok, so it begins pretty good, logical, humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh f@rt,@ss, f"ock stupidity that makes total sense. the strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it, though i guess it is supposed to be funny, with a very serious message. after a moment of thought why i didn't laugh, the answer was pretty clear... this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be. so it is extremely dumb, yet very wise if the object was to reach people which aren't 'blessed' with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes?). this movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience!<br /><br />although they probably just laugh.<br /><br />ah well, nice try...<br /><br />i am now editing (well adding to) my comment, cause i read some of the other comments. first i noticed some people see racism in this movie. well, that did not at all cross my mind when watching it. however, i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective, you will see some. we could of course debate the link between intelligence and race, but i think this is not the place to do so. i wonder, if we were to rate the huxtable family here, would you complain about them all being black? i don't think so, but i guess you could... (aside from that, from the 2 wisest people in the world, half, the woman, doesn't seem totally caucasian to me, so 'what the problem is?')<br /><br />secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings; from 1's to 10's and everything in between, but a lot of polarisation there, which means the movie does its job very well! it stirrs people up, makes them want to speak about it and judge it. that means it is a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. after 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even, yet you keep watching this utter crap. i guess you keep hoping that it isn't so. or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents. well, this is one for sure.
