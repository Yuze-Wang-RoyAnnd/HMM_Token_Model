joe (wes) & jim (adam) re-acquaint us with the beauty, isolation (psychological as well as physical) and utter terror of "murder most fowl" in the navaho southwest. characterizations, settings and plot continually build .. . even if at times the personal asides leave us wanting "more" .. . with some interesting alternative choices as to "who done it?" flashbacks (e.g. peter fonda . .. good to see him) provide clues but they don't go where you might think. comic asides (e.g. the preacher) are mild and appropriate. where "skinwalkers" and "coyote waits" start to drag .. . "thief" engages the clutch and four-wheels you around the next corner, never quite sure what's there. disagree with joe leaphorn's manic comment to jim chee to "slow down" for the potholes. wrong ... there are no potholes in the plot, just tracks to follow. on to the next episode! great photography (as always), appealing characters and more to explore!
