the ma & pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial. the films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. one obvious reference is 'the beverly hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. you could even say the 1980s sitcom 'newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. still, i wonder if betty macdonald, the washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good. her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness. (the real life family that macdonald based the kettles upon, successfully sued...claiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less-than-flattering references). sure, it's comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun moments...and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. but i think macdonald could've still written these characters more sensibly and universal international could've had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity (there's such a thing as good taste). the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. for their part, the kettles have to realize that they don't exactly fit into a modern world. that's not a joke...that's a sober truth.
