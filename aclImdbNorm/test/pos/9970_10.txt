i am always impressed when a director (and this case director/screenwriter) takes a piece of classical text - and makes it come alive. sure, shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with self-importance, but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so - by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe-inspiring. there are many troubling things about the play. it is a racist play about racism - and that still sticks. i have never accepted jessica's desertion of her father without any acceptable reason. i have never accepted the christians' position of sanctimonious self-righteousness. but, brilliantly, there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set, and mercifully, much of jessica's part is cut.<br /><br />the text is quite stripped down with many passages cut. but, i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. this economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie - not just a film of the play.<br /><br />and at last, there is a rationale as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserving/unrelated bassanio - you can almost feel antonio's pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of bassanio passing by in a gondola, or arriving for a visit. but it is as subtle as that - no more. i was spellbound.<br /><br />there were many other highlights. i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking. and, the suitors' trials are hilarious.<br /><br />add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times, and you'll understand why i can't wait to see it again. and again.
