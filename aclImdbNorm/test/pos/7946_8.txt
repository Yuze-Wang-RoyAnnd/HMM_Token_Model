many accuse rod steiger of overacting, and anyone who has seen the amityville horror and the 'fly' section would struggle to say otherwise. that said, he's brilliant in this.<br /><br />it's never on tv, you can't buy it on dvd (legitimately). in 1988, when channel 4 still had a prescription for innovation, they showed this amongst a small amalgam of 60s films, privilege etc - and i remember an essentially theatrical experience, transposed well to film. the great thing about theatre is it's enclosed - how do you make it available and interesting on screen? ph just about pulls it off. because this sort of film is never even on cable or sky tv anywhere it's hard to get a debate going, but for anyone out there who has seen it or can remember, my memories are of a forthright, almost strident performance by sally geeson 'thats all taken care of' (which eschews the almost diffident general performances of her and her sibling in many early 70s offerings) she says ref conception. there are several of these - key lines you remember years, decades on. that's the power of a film like this.<br /><br />ps i just saw it again and its just as good. one day, tv too will be enlightened.
