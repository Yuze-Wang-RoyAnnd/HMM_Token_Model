it's a talking, trigger happy, alcoholic ass cop! i have seen the first and second episodes. the artwork and animation fits very well (note the facial expressions, lol). the main character being a gun toting, badge wearing, pair of butt cheeks, shooting at whoever he thinks to be offensive or "guilty". so far, the episodes have had simple and followable plots that work very well with assy's investigations. don sanchez, assy's partner, play's the sobering retort to assy's a.a. antics and random "i've got a hunch" leads. assy's lines are very funny and clever, here's one for example, "i've got one bullet and its got your email address on it, don't make me hit send" *bang* "looks like your in-box just got some new mail." the think box at assy mcgee's headquarters are so far, consistent and on cue. as for the sound, it's perfect, the sound effects and voice work are 9/10. assy sounds like sylvester stallone all boozed up, don sanchez, the mayor, the chief of police, all have voices that "fit" there persona's very well. i recommend this to anyone who wants to catch a few laughs before they go to bed, as it does air on adult swim on sunday nights. very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10/10
