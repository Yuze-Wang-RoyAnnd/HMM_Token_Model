a great performance by emily grace! i stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. i was high entertained and had much compassion for the character "alice" played by emily grace. the story had me guessing in what would happen to alice and was not predicable. the overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. the ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. i will purchase this dvd to add to my library. i am a new fan of emily grace and i high anticipate in seeing more from her performances.
