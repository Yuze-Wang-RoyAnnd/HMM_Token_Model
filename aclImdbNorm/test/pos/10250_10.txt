this film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast. glynn turman, (preach jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend. lawrence hilton jacobs, (cochise morris) was an outstanding athlete at the cooley h.s. and even won a scholarship to a famous college. there are scenes in this picture with the chicago police department chasing all these dudes in a cadillac and a visit to the lincoln park zoo with monkey dung being thrown around. the music is outstanding and there is great photography around the city of chicago. great film, enjoy.
