this is one of those films that looks so "dated" that being that way is part of the fun. you see and hear things you would never see or hear on the silver screen today. some of that is good; some it too corny for words, some of it bad (depending on your viewpoints on certain cultural issues.)<br /><br />for instance, in this short (68 minutes) 1931 film you have:<br /><br />the grandpa of the family that is featured in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why one should speak up against criminals for the good of the united states (picture that in today's films!)<br /><br />a district attorney (walter huston) almost begging for death penalty sentences and the populace shown as supporting it 100 percent (once again, picture that in modern-day movies.) <br /><br />along the way you have some shocking violence, such as a young boy being picked up a few times and literally thrown head first into a closet, and his father being picked up and swung repeatedly head-first into a wall. this is a tough stuff, to say the least. <br /><br />yet the film is dotted with comedy, mostly by the patriotic grandpa, memorably played by charles "chic" sales. there are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film. and, for soft touches, there are the two young boys, one of whom - dickie moore - went on to become a pretty famous child actor in his day. here, he is just a little tyke of about 5 years of age who, understandably, is far from being a polished actor, but you can see stardom for him on the horizon. in fact, he did just that the following year with a solid performance in "blonde venus," starring marlene dietrich.<br /><br />anyway, this is an entertaining film because of an effective mixture of violence, comedy and sentimentality....and it has a nice feel-good ending and a thought-provoking message. it was up for an academy award, too, for "best writing, original story." i am sorry to say it is only available for viewing on cable tv as it has never been put out on vhs or dvd.....and that's a shame.
