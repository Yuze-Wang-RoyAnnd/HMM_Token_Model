while some of the things in haggard are dumb and unnecessary, the overall package is good. <br /><br />haggard follows ryan dunn and his friends valo (bam margera) and falcone (brandon dicamillo) trying to win back glauren (jenn rivell), ryan's ex. <br /><br />the story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of jackass or viva la bam, although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story.<br /><br />and, for all the bam fan boys (and girls) there are multiple sequences of bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even don vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll.<br /><br />if you are hoping to see a comedy and escape bam's craziness, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. there are some truly funny scenes in this film.
