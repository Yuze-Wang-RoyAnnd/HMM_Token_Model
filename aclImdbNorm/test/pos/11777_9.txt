i just got the dvd for hardware wars, in a shiny new package, looking irresistable. stuck it in my dvd player to find a slew of extra fun stuff. the extra content on the dvd is even longer than the movie. for those of you that have (shame!) never seen hardware wars, it one fantastically silly star wars spoof (of episode iv, of course). household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuums, and a waffle maker) stand in for ty-fighters, x-wings, r2d2, and the death star. instead of princess leia, we have princess ann-droid, complete with cinnabon hairdo. you get the point, i'm sure. mad silliness, and a fun ride for any star wars geek (like me!)<br /><br />now, the dvd - wow! a director's commentary where he basically goes off on the movie, making fun of himself and the project throughout. an interview with fosselius on creature features (remember that?!) and hilarious "director's cut" and "foreign version" of the movie (all jokes of course). anyway, this is great. i loved hardware wars in the theater, and am so glad for having the dvd in my collection - wedged in between mst3k: the movie and thumb wars!
