i absolutely love this show!!!!!!!, its basically fox's improved version of the simpsons (cau'se lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you're above the age of 9. it's political, irrational, and irresistible. anyone who says they don't like it is lying, there is a character for every one. peter, stewie, & quagmire are my favorites. peter because he is rude, obnoxious, and just doesn't give a crap. stewie because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it. and quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes. also there is an episode for everybody too. if you're the political type there is mr. griffin goes to washington (vol.2 season 3). if you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible (vol.2 season 3.). or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit janet (vol.1 season2).basicly what i'm saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone. giggity giggity gooooo!
