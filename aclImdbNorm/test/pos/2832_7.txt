on the whole one wishes this was a better film, but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while. peck made this film during the same period that he made the gunfighter, before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor. a pity! he was a fine actor, perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable, and to do them extremely well. the character he plays here is driven and, when necessary, ruthless. given the mission the character has been assigned, and the "men" with which to do it, those characteristics are essential.<br /><br />without being a spoiler, think of this film as an early, grittier example of the dirty dozen genre. <br /><br />the dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling. it contains good work by all the character actors and even barbara payton turns in a credible performance.<br /><br />this one isn't often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. go ahead! devote an evening to it. it is worth your time!
