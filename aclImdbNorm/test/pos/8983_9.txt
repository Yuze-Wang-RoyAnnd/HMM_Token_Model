this film grabs you from the opening scenes and never lets go. you watch indulgently upon viewing janos szaby's excitement over coming to america. he's a likable fellow. you cannot help being fond of him even when his eagerness is replaced by bitterness as his fortunes turn. you know that in his circumstances,you would be forced to make the same choices he does to survive. this movie comments on society's worship of beauty and all things superficial and is only more true in the culture of the twenty-first century. janos himself becomes victim to this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you're young and beautiful; if you could see, you would have the world." and like many a modern gangster movie, when her safety is threatened, he extracts a powerful revenge. his innocence is not altogether lost however for he demands an equally high price of himself, knowing he deserves his fate.<br /><br />peter lorre is in fine form in this starring role. only a few actors could convincingly accomplish this character's transformation from innocent to embittered criminal in sixty nine minutes. lorre is well supported by all the cast making this a real ensemble picture and not just a vehicle for one star. with a bit less preachy dialogue, this movie would be a 10. highly recommended.
