this is an excellent movie and i would recommend it to everyone. mr. drury's acting is top notch as it always is and he blends well with the other actors in the movie. can't give away any of the suspense or drama found in the movie. hell to pay is a must see movie!!! the plot was very suspenseful. i would watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great western movie. it was very authentic in how they displayed the components dealing with this movie which includes the guns, horses, and clothing. the soundtrack is enjoyable and adds flavor to the movie. james drury has the right touch when picking out a movie to be involved with. this is a another winner for the western genre. !!!!!
