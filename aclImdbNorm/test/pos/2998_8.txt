i don't go for that many "heist" comedies, and i might not care for this one if it weren't for the actors, when it was made, and when i first saw it (just a few years later). it's almost too similar to "the happening" (even though it's obviously a much less serious comedy than that one) - mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping, or rather, turns it in a different direction altogether. of course, raquel welch didn't play the kind of sharp character faye dunaway did in the happening, but that doesn't make it a sexist film either - she was practically playing a stock character, almost her version of a "moll"! but, i'm completely biased - it's among the first films i ever saw with her, and at the time i saw it, you couldn't turn around without seeing a poster of her (luckily). i think robert wagner was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor dis-likable leader of the group, as were edward g. robinson (naturally) and vittoria de sica. and godfrey cambridge, an actor who always managed to be funny.
