a very sweet movie about a young chinese man enamored of western technology and an englishman trying to make his fortune showing movies in china. it's a very interesting story that is presumably based on true events, although i'm assuming it's more fantasy than real. it's got a fairy tale quality you rarely get in real life, and it's also got 8 people credited for the script, so they must have been making up stuff right and left.<br /><br />this is a very likable movie that conveys how magical film was to people who had never seen it before. it is not an especially deep movie, touching briefly on the loss of tradition and the encroachment of western culture but mainly just being a pleasant little movie. it's actually a movie i enjoyed very much that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. light as a souffl'e, but i enjoyed every minute.
