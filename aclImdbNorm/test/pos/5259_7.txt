mary haines (meg ryan) a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (eva mendes). she doesn't know what to do and friends sylvia fowler (annette bening), edie cohen (debra messing) and alex fisher (jad pinkett smith) try to help.<br /><br />ok--there was no reason to redo the 1939 movie. that's a true classic and doesn't need to be updated and redone. naturally it was done. this has gotten some of the worst reviews i've ever seen for a motion picture. i love the original and have seen it many times--i was constantly comparing it to that. now this isn't a classic but it's not that bad.<br /><br />**minor spoilers!!!** first the bad--the story is old and was (badly) updated. really--a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today. meg ryan (a wonderful actress) is pretty terrible here. her face seems unable to change expression! i couldn't believe how bad some of her scenes came over. eva mendes is bad too--but it's not entirely her fault. her role is badly written and she has to compete with joan crawford from the original. smith's character (a tough lesbian) goes to pieces in an operating room. it is funny...but it's showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an emergency. also the script inserts some clumsy passages where ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself. in those moments it seems more like a lifetime movie than anything else.<br /><br />now the good--this movie retains the originals' decision to never show a man on screen. this movie is about and for women--men aren't needed (btw--i'm a man). bening is just great as fowler--whenever she's on screen the movie makes a great leap. also smith is just wonderful--she doesn't overplay (or underplay) her lesbian character too much. messing is good too but she's not in this much. bette midler is just hysterical in a small role and cloris leachman pulls off the nothing role of a housekeeper. the direction is good too--especially during a fashion show sequence. i heard director diane english purportedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full-length movie but it doesn't show in the final product. also there are some clever references to the original (mostly certain lines) that were inserted with no fuss.<br /><br />i saw this in an audience full of women (there were a few guys but not many) and they loved it. the movie ends on an operating room sequence that had everybody howling. so--this wasn't needed but it's not the disaster people are saying it is. also--people are saying we don't need a movie with all women. well--why not? i see plenty of movies with all guys in the cast and no one complains about that! ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this. with a better performance by ryan i might have given this an 8 or 9 but, as it is, i can only give it a 7.
