i can barely even remember what decade i saw this film. it was when i was a teenager, i think (i'm 37 now). i started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. seeing other comments, i had no idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. i don't think i've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.<br /><br />but half a lifetime later, i still remember much of the movie that i watched late at night so long ago. i think the innocence of the charactors, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period of time, left a long term imprint for reasons i don't quite understand. maybe it is because i was a teenager at the time i saw it, and it touched me somehow..... i really don't know! i also really wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened. oh, the agony!!<br /><br />i've not seen it before, or since, but i would love to. i keep a casual look out for it, but i now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. but i'd proberbly miss it in the tv guide even if it did show up. pssttt!!!<br /><br />reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. if anyone knows of its availability in australia, by all means email me and let me know.<br /><br />oh, and sean bury... nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here. i've had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a james bond film. what are you up to these day? oh, and do you have a copy of the film? cheers!!!
