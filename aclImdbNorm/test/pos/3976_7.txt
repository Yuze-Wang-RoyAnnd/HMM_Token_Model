i saw the trailer and read some reviews, and i had low expectations for this movie. i was pleasantly surprised. while the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. the writing and jokes are far more literate than i have come to expect. better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.<br /><br />the main reasons i wanted to see this movie were justin long and lewis black. long is from "ed" and the new apple computer ads. he was just coming into his own as an actor in "ed," and he was excellent here. he's a natural in front of the camera. lewis black is a social commentator who pulls no punches. he's on "the daily show" on comedy central about once every two weeks, but he really shines in hbo's "red, white, and screwed." i regularly catch him on xm radio's uncensored comedy channel. give black an idea and let him improvise. whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter. he's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst. one thing about black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. it just seems like he's having a conversation with you, and i think that makes him unconsciously more effective.
