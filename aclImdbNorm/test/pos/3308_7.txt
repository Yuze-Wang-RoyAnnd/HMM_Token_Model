a hugely enjoyable screen version of rona jaffe's best-selling pot-boiler about the trials and tribulations, (and, naturally, the loves), of a group of women involved in one way or another in the new york publishing business. directed by jean negulesco, fairly fresh from the success of "three coins in a fountain", and the prototype for the likes of "sex and the city", except that here the sex all takes place off-screen.<br /><br />the bright young female talents of the day, (hope lange, diane baker, suzy parker, martha hyer), are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor who could probably eat meryl streep's miranda priestly and spit her out; with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie. the men include stephen boyd, louis jourdan, (if it wasn't rossano brazzi it had to be louis jourdan), robert evans, (before he decided, wisely, to go behind the camera) and brian aherne. there are more suds on display than you will find in your average launderette but if, like me, you enjoy "desperate housewives", not to mention carrie bradshaw and company then you will probably love this. a very guilty pleasure.
