amateur camera work aside, i thought this movie was very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts i have read, i got something totally different out of the ending than others. the premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church. how they must adhere to all the rigid rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have problems staying on track, what with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language. yet she prays a lot, as does her family. then one day they are headed to a church picnic and are in an accident. from there the parents and her brother change; what with being knocked out and "saved" by jesus. warning: major spoiler alert. or so we are led to believe. i think if you watch this movie from the point of view of the daughter only, then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we, the audience, thinks is an actual occurrence with the parents and son, is in fact all a dream, and from the daughter's pov. this would explain a lot of the actions portrayed by the parents and the son, which were totally opposite of how they lived before, especially the sex, and also would also explain why peggy got away with murder, etc. look at how perfect that pie is, but go back and look at the cake betty makes. that is unless caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced. and also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents, laying there in each others arms, and her brother, all whom of which seemed to die very peacefully, even if being poisoned, fits with a dream sequence.
