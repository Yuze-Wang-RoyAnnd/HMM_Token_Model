this is a "docu-drama" of (mostly) the later years of kw's life, with nearly all the parts played by actors (but spot which tv quartermaster plays himself!). it was made for the bbc4 arts channel but my guess is there will be syndication and dvd releases soon. kw is ably played by the excellent michael sheen, here repeating his previous stage role with great success. most of the supporting cast are also very good, and a nice touch is the recreation of period tv appearances with the new actors. this is not, however, light viewing - anyone familiar with kw's diaries and general unhappy demeanour will already know how twisted he could be in later life - so don't expect 80 minutes of carry on styled buffoonery, since the emphasis is decidedly downbeat throughout. recommended, but it's tragi-comic, indeed.
