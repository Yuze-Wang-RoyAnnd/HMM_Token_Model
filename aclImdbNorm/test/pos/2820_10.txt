i'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. however, seizing me is really an amazing piece of work. the story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. my partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. it was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to "get tea" and i felt compelled to have a shower. the story was gripping but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in one straight shot. (it delves into the gritty and grimy side of people, but doesn't leave you there). i thought about the characters and deeper meanings for a long time. i would highly recommend this one. still be prepared for an experience you might not be expecting.
