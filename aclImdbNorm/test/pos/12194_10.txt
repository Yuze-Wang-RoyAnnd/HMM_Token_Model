i've seen this movie countes times now and still can't get sick of it. it's like a frickin' drug. i know a lot of people don't like it but there's something about it that just draws me in. every single performance is spectacular, but aaliyah is the one who steals the show. she not only played the role of akasha she became it. her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well. it's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an egyptian queen (no, i'm not predjudice against white people, i am one). true it's not known what color the ancient egyptians really were but this was a nice change. stuart townsend completely made me forget about tom cruise's portrayel of lestat and marguerite was striking once again. all in all it was a good time at the movies. for those who haven't seen it, be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously. i mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. take it as that.
