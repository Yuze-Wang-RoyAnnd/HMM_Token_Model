i first saw this masterpiece on vhs 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation on angry-kid-painfully-against-established-society it carried stayed in my heart since then. director hector babenco is such a good humanity, who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class. even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams. but the corrupt reality never gives a chance...<br /><br />thanks to the publishers for the recent dvd release, i now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection.
