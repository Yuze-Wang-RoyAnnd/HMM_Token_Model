burt reynolds directed this action movie and (surprise!) he is actually a pretty good director. this movie starts off well as burt's attempted bust of a drug dealer is botched, and he is demoted down to the vice squad. the ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes as brian kieth is always eating something, bernie casey has more class than all of his co-workers combined, and charles durning loses control of his squad.<br /><br />the vice cops stumble on a high-priced call-girl ring that may have something to do with a series of murders. sharkey spends days staking out dominoe's (rachel ward) apartment, and starts to really adore her from afar.<br /><br />just when they are getting close to the crime leader, dominoe is murdered. i won't give away any of the surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this film is great.<br /><br />unfortunately, the screenplay gets very clich'ed and unbelievable after that.<br /><br />why would burt reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret? sure it makes the guy sweat, but it causes many more cops to be killed. and it is not believable that dominoe and sharkey would make love after they have know each other for one day, much less while their lives are in danger. and at the end, what happened to all the police that run into the building with our heroes? isn't there a swat team? also, the film never actually tells you how all of the bad guys are connected, and why they have to kill so many people.<br /><br />there is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film, which is probably the only really nail-biting scene of the film. it is a shame that the climax is a typical shoot-em-up. still, this film is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action movies. don't think about the plot holes, and you will have a good time.
