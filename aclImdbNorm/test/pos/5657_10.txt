this is one of the most anti-traditional war movies about was i have seen. instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps super-human characters (like john wayne), this film is the exact opposite--stressing the de-humanization that also happens in war. the story concerns the japanese who are stranded in the phillipines after the us returned in late 1944-early 1945. by the time the movie begins, the japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of bushido, they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender. at one of many poignant moments, the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isn't capable of fighting due to his tb. the problem is that the hospital won't accept him, so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospital--and if they won't accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade! well, this happens just in the first five minutes of the movie--a lot worse things befall this soldier and the few stragglers because they won't surrender. plus, there is a case in the movie where a soldier does try to surrender but is gunned down. this happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering japanese soldiers booby-trapped themselves to blow up when they came near. in addition, the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film i have seen. in addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty, realistic and depressingly realistic film. you simply couldn't have made a better film of this type. horrible but great.
