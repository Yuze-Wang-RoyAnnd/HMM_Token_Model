***spoilers*** this film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of johnny carson to determine who would succeed him. the impersonations of david letterman and jay leno are performed in a satisfactory way by john michael higgins and daniel roebuck, though the performances weren't great. reni santoni is the best-performing of the "execs" (he plays john agoglia of nbc), and warren littlefield (played by bob baliban) is a close second. i was shocked at the way in which littlefield eagerly discussed dumping johnny carson. this was johnny carson! this scene evinces the cut-throat, what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of television. kathy bates delivered the best performance of the film as jay's agent, helen kushnick. another commenter asserted that leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. i respectfully disagree. the relationship with kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence. she orders him around, and, when he rebels against her at the end, she tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when jay terminates their relationship, she turns violent again, screaming "don't you leave me, you two-faced bastard!" before smashing a picture on the floor. overall, the movie is hilarious, and i wish that it were shown more often.
