this movie is beautiful in all ways. it is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. the acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. ben daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. there is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. it is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience. it isn't a movie for anyone who wants normality.
