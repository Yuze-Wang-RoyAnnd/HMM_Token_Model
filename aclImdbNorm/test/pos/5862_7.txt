barbet schroeder's "murder by numbers" starring sandra bullock is solid work, though not particularly compelling. i am a big sandra bullock fan, and she is effective here as forensic detective cassie mayweather, who is not very likable and a broken person too. however, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the story structure. it's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers, richard (ryan gusling) who is the cool one, and justin ( michael pitt) who is the sympathetic geek. basically, richard and justin kill a young woman, because they have nothing better to do on a school night. they are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing, but it just doesn't work here. tony gayton's script does a great job of detailing the investigation of a puzzling murder, and it is truly by the numbers. we have these two punk kids flaunting their superiority, and we just want them to take a fall. <br /><br />this is not a great exploration into the dark side, like schroeder's "reversal of fortune" about claus von bulow. there are interesting turns in "numbers". the movie is not so much a thriller, but rather a character study of cassie. sandra bullock balances the bravado of cassie, her fear of letting people get in with her, and her secret past. bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. her partner and sort of love interest, sam (played by ben chaplin), is more a plot unconcealing than a real character. though chaplin does the bewilderment thing very admirably. the other nice touch is having richard and justin involved a strange sexual attraction. the most interesting thing about "numbers" are pitt and gusling. <br /><br />there are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie. everything is done very competently. i saw the movie about a week ago, and in retrospect i like it a little more than i did when i saw it. however, it is just not inspired work. sandra bullock and barbet schroeder deserve a lot better, and so do we.
