talk about your classics! ernie fossilus (the foss from here on out) came up with a cute and creative trailer totally spoofing star wars. this gem is so jammed packed with tributes and gags i laugh every time! not only that, when star wars did a re-issue with new special effects, hardware wars did the same! talk about a spoof that just won't die! there's a reason george lucas calls this his favorite parody. he was so impressed, he even hired the foss to work on "return of the jedi" (don't believe me, check his entry in imdb!)<br /><br />this has to be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. i think the special edition was a bit overdone, but on reflection, i think it's perfect for the modern day re-release of star wars, and goes to prove that sometimes, it's wrong to mess with perfection.<br /><br />yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth your time.<br /><br />you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $3 goodbye! well, maybe 15 for the dvd, but you'll be real happy you did.
