if you watched this film for the nudity (as i did) you won't be disappointed. i could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though. some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it was i think h.o.t.s. has to be the best of its genre.<br /><br />it is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times.<br /><br />i would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any day.<br /><br />it is a shame that the dvd doesn't have any extras but as they didn't have dvds when this was filmed that is understandable. i would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end.
