rent this, i own the dvd, got it for $9.99. a steal being so under-rated. sure, there are better movies. movies with fewer or no holes in the plot or action. but i don't have that problem with this movie. for me if a movie stays true to itself, honest and exploitive of its flaws (and virtues, obviously!) in the name of entertainment, then it has fulfilled its purpose. i got me to care, because its makers cared. the entire movie is preposterous from beginning to end, but its makers took the whole undertaking seriously, and i did not feel manipulated into taking the movie seriously. and that is so true, because i want to take every movie seriously yet many, oh so many, let me down. for all of its preposterousness, this movie is almost perfect, and completely entertaining!what a funny screenplay! it also has become eerily relevant in light of the events on 9/11. in no way do i seek to minimize the loss. but this movie incorporates the tradegy of the wtc collapse before it happened in ways that we will never see had the movie been made after those events.<br /><br />"...it's either gone for good, or here to stay." "wouldn't you agree?"
