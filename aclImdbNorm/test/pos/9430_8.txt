dr. franz tobel, a swiss scientist, is smuggled out of his home country by sherlock holmes in order that the nazi agents spying him do not get his invention of a new bomb sight. arriving in london, he takes residence with holmes and watson, but goes out for a visit with his girlfriend, charlotte eberli, where he leaves a clue for holmes as to the locations of his bomb sight, which he has divided into four pieces, but holmes' eternal nemesis, professor moriarity, is also seeking the bomb sight to sell to the nazis, and abducts dr. tobel and the clue left at charlotte's, a code series of dancing men, which both holmes and moriarity are both unable to decipher completely. holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb sight, but moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable. very good entry in the holmes series with plenty of mystery and guesswork to go about. atwill's portrayal of moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning sort described in the doyle stories (or george zucco's performance in the adventures of sherlock holmes), but atwill's skills as an actor makes his moriarity quite the benevolent fellow. the script and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well. great job on the cinematography as well. rating, 8.
