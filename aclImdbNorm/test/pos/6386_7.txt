an unusual movie, which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country. but a twist soon turns the tale upside down. most of the film hits the right buttons: the story develops smoothly, acting is solid (sienna miller's drawl is priceless, she really can act!), chemistry between both leads works, and rolling american rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time. the mood, which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times.<br /><br />at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like, but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat. alexandre montin, paris
