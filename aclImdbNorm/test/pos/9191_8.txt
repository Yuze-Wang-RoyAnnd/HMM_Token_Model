this existential thriller, in portuguese with english subtitles, is a modern version of the american filmes noires of the 40s, complete with a surprise twist at the end. it is riveting from beginning to end. my only criticism is its poor production values. the film looks cheaply made, and it probably was, so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of godard in vivre sa vie, to cite another film noir of more than 30 years earlier. most maddening of all, the subtitles are often hard to read. when will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background. i'd give this an 8 overall, although with better production values it could have been higher.
