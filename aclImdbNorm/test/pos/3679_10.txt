what an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and i stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in north texas. kathy bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing. it is obvious that we as a general public are being force-fed that which has been deemed "great and wonderful" by the powerful and influential while true gems such as "unconditional love" manage to shine thru all those pretenders to really enjoyable cinema. rent or buy this movie.....you won't regret it!
