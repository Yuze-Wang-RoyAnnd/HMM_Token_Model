i found this movie on one of my old videos, after "godzilla vs. the sea monster" (which should instantly give you an idea of it's tone) and i hadn't seen it in a while so i decided to watch it. i didn't remember much about rainbow brite except i used to like the cartoon and that it was cute. most people feel that way about her. you probably do to.<br /><br />well, when the movie started, i wondered if it was the right one! it didn't fit the mold of rainbow brite as i remembered her. but it turns out she kicks butt! this has to be the strangest animated movie ever! i can't believe these characters were so popular (the series isn't much different) while being so bizzare. as soon as i watched this movie again, it became one of my favorites.<br /><br />i really don't want to give too much away. just know that if you see the movie in the video store, rent it and watch it. no questions asked. you will get a kick out of it. especially the outrageous princess character. and the robotic horse. and the hypnotized sprites. <br /><br />if you can't tell by know, this is an 80's cartoon that is really an undiscovered "head" movie in disguise! have fun!
