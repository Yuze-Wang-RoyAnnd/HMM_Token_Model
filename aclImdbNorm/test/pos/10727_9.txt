if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951's streetcar named desire. i imagine i'll discover some others that qualify, but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. so its a very satisfying experience on that level: just watching the marvelous, probing performances of dustin hoffman, meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular. one of the best child performances ever.<br /><br />but i also find it very satisfying to watch, because its such a thoroughly involving story - it always makes me forget my own problems. it has such excellent narrative drive. once you stick kramer vs kramer on, and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. and even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again.<br /><br />make no mistake - kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved.<br /><br />10/10.<br /><br />for one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between benton and hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. not to mention what a great, involving story it is. put simply, a perfect film.
