it's the best movie i've watched this year! excellent detail and storyline (for a remake).<br /><br />it presents to you a "what if" situation wherein the island of japan could totally be wiped out of this earth. a thought-provoking, life and death situation and not to mention all life on earth (well in this particular japan). it also presents a great and genius solution to this massive tragedy.<br /><br />horror, action, suspense, sci fi, documentary, love story and all the human interest story you can get you'll find everything here! but i also warn you that it is a real tearjerker! the casts, actors and all are all excellent, better than any hollywood movie! <br /><br />the thing is...this could really happen to anywhere on earth! now let me ask you this after you've seen it..."what would you do if you are faced in this life and death situation"?
