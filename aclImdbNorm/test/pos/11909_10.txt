i liked this movie. that's pretty much all i can say about it. lou gossett did a good job, even though i'm still very disappointed in him after all the iron eagle movies. and even if i was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies (i won't give it away) it was done in a nice, fitting fashion. pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! it's another one of those movies i found real cheap, so i bought it, and i recommend the same.
