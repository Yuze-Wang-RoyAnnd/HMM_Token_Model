"talk radio" is my favorite oliver stone movie, though he has made many great ones including "salvador", "jfk", "natural born killers" and "platoon". but i like the intimacy of "talk radio", a cinematic expansion of eric bogosian's searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a dallas talk show host. working with ace cinematographer robert richardson, stone turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse barry champlain and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. alec baldwin, as his alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. ellen greene is fantastic as barry's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. stone and bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. john c. mcginley, as barry's long-suffering screener/technical producer stu, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great michael wincott. the film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. the stewart copeland score is brilliant, too.
