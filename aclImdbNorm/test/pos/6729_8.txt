i remember watching this as a child as part of the children;s film foundations friday film specials on cbbc and have recently happened upon a copy.<br /><br />in the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothing.<br /><br />it is an atmospheric tale which entices with cornish folklore and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young miner billy.<br /><br />shot in the wonderfully scenic port loe area of cornwall the film utilises the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable.<br /><br />there is much packed into this cff drama, something long since lost from children's television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy.
