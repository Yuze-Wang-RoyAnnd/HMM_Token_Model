sexy murderess tiffany (jennifer tilly) still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex-boyfriend, crazed killer charles 'chucky' lee ray. after getting her hands on the mutilated good guy doll that last played host to his spirit, and doing a spot of repair work, she conducts a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy.<br /><br />unfortunately for poor tiff, the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she traps him in a cage, with a bride doll for company. eventually, a rather angry chucky (voiced by brad dourif) escapes his confines, electrocutes tiffany in the bath, and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution.<br /><br />realising that they are now both in the same predicament, the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for hackensack, new jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts. tricking trailer park hunk jesse (nick stabile) and his tasty girlfriend jade (katherine heigl) into taking them to their destination, the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage, with their unwitting companions copping the blame.<br /><br />although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical, it wasn't until the fourth film in the child's play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise, opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares (although there is still plenty of ott splatter for us gore-hounds to enjoy).<br /><br />talented hong kong director ronny yu oversees proceedings, deftly translating the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride. similarly, the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly, with stabile and heigl making a likable couple, but smoking hot tilly stealing the show as blonde, buxom, pouting, pvc-mini-skirted temptress tiffany. kevin yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success.<br /><br />overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst 'serious' horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humour, crazy death scenes, and magnificent cleavages should have a blast.
