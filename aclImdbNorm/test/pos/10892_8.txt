there isn't much that comes close to the perfect-paced storytelling and suspenseful action-packed levels as "goldeneye". when it came out, it was the greatest game of all-time, and even today, it stays strong.<br /><br />i will admit that this game did get boring after a few months of playing, and by not playing it again until two years later, i was thrust back into its greatest, almost as if i was playing it for the first time again.<br /><br />there are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most of any james bond game to date. probably the most unforgettable one is the tank level, which was likely the most explosive video game sequence at that time. and the first-person shooting as well as usage of q gadgets is what james bond fans are always dying to use.<br /><br />frankly, as a james bond fan, i look for aspects of a true james bond experience, which are now showing up in the ps2 games. so this game, while it has some great action and usable gadgets, i was somewhat expecting a little more, even back in 1997. i also disliked that this game didn't have q or m or moneypenny, or anyone from mi6. while watching the movies, bond interacts with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie, but they are nowhere to be seen in this game. and vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively rather than the text dialogue they wound up using. they had the technology. they just didn't use it.<br /><br />probably the most annoying feature of this game is that in some ways it follows the story of the movie precisely, and other ways it's incoherent. for example, there are two many levels where you have to protect or save natalya, even though in the movie she can take care of herself. there are also some unnecessary levels, like the boat level where you have to disarm some bombs (which is not in the movie), which adds nothing to the storyline whatsoever. there are even some levels where you rescue natalya, but at the beginning of the next level, she's captured again. how?<br /><br />oh well. even those little things can't really put this game down. and while i do prefer the newer games, this bond experience is definitely one you won't forget.<br /><br />8 out of 10
