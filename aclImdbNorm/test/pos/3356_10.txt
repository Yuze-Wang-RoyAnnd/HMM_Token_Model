when i was engaged, my fiance and i would frequent the adult bookstores. he would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. as much as i enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that i really enjoyed. i had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called xxx (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. all the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot. there's only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking 'it'.<br /><br />this movie caught my eye, and i migrated to it, allowing him to wander the shop. he noticed (how hard was it not too? grins. i was actually interested in something, lol(!) in the video section!) and came over, buying the slightly used copy for me. we took it home and i loved it. here was a "porno" with a plot. i wasn't sure it even classified as porno, but i use the word loosely.<br /><br />the librarian was a character i could identify with. alice rejected her boyfriend's advances. she was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. bill went away, and she continued to check in books. the white rabbit ran through the library (one book, if you notice closely, i believe (it's been ten years since i saw the movie) was by lewis c.) and alice, for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas, follows. it's the best way to get the plot forward. alice finds herself in wonderland.<br /><br />i barely recall all the details, but i do remember clearly the swim in the lake, and how she was "dried" off. i liked how they got humpty dumpty up again, the mad hatter's size of member being on his hat to wear it proudly, and the brother sister team of dum and dee (which did disturb me slightly--then again, they could have been husband wife, but i never could tell no matter how many times i watched it). the woman on the knight who told alice go away and find your own knight (what's a a nice girl like you doing on a knight like this?).<br /><br />the part that really caught my attention when i watched it about a year or so later was one of the cards (3 of hearts, i think) who resembled my ex's current wife exactly! we couldn't help but tease her about being in the movie! the king of hearts was interesting, and the queen was even more so. due to the openness of the forum, i can't go into details, just say it was "orgy" based and we'll leave it at that!<br /><br />when we split up, i was allowed to take the video--he knew i liked it--but in the time since it's been lost in borrowing. someday i'll find another copy.<br /><br />btw, if anyone could tell me offlist what scene was cut from the amazon version, i'd really appreciate it.<br /><br />i heartily recommend this movie for the over 18 crowd. it was soft, sweet, and really 70's, but i liked it immensely.<br /><br />***** out of 5. d.
