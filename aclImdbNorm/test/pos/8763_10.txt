it is hard to put the devastating beauty of traffik to words, partly because i am still grasping to comprehend it myself, several hours after my second viewing. first, it must be said that traffik contains some of the most incomparably and unforgettably haunting scenes i have seen in a film or television production. the acting is excellent, particularly that of bill paterson as a british minister grappling with his heroin-addicted daughter and an aid deal to pakistan that hinges on drug issues. another plot line describes these drug issues at a ground level in pakistan, and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. the third main storyline involves the prosecution of a hamburg drug importer, and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two german detectives while he is under trial. it is a profound accomplishment that the interaction between these stories feels natural, transcending the forced plot entanglement often found in hollywood movies. it is an even greater accomplishment that a work spread over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and enthralling, without having to oversimplify. it is devastating--bleak and brutal but never apathetic. in short, traffik is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with unmatched compassion and clarity.
