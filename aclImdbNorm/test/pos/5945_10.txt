it's a deeply stupid humor... but i loved it. jean dujardin is a great actor in this movie. b'er'enice b'ejo is cute. it makes fun of all the secret agents like james bond: refreshing!!! it's probably the most hilarious movie i've ever seen. i already saw it three times and i still want to see it again. buy the dvd as soon as you can. you won't regret it. it's the kind of movie in which you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody. the only defect is that oss 117 is too short. it's a jewel. it's not really frequent to see a french movie get success in the usa but i think that this one has everything to succeed. trust me!!!
