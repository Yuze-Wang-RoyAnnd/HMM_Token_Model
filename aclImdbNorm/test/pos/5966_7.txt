the ascent is a very worthwhile addition to recent re-releases from the soviet union. director larisa shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in german occupied russia during the second world war. on foot and in a blizzard, two members of a partisan soviet group leave to locate supplies, and are captured by nazi soldiers. the focus of the movie is on how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives. one chooses dignity and integrity, while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy. however, in the end, he cannot abide by his selfish decision. the film makes much use of slow, wide-angle pans which shift to extreme closeups, and highlight the spiritual quandary within the souls of each man. this is not a great film, but it does effectively portray an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and frigid soviet wilderness.
