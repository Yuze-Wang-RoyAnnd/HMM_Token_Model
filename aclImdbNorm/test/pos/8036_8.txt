i will not comment on the story as such. i agree with most peoples comments that this is a good all round action movie with a well told story and good acting.<br /><br />this film deserves 100% for cinematography for its opening sequence. the opening shot is stunning and i have not yet figured out how they did it. the movie is worth watching for that shot alone! a pity therefore that the dvd that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given as to the making of the film. let's hope somebody comes up with the special edition.<br /><br />and the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing! great stuff. a must have for a collector of classic film moments.
