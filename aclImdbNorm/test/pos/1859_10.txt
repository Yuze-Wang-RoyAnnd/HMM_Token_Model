i have read reviews of this film that found it 'disappointing' and 'confused'. i am at a loss to understand why this should be so. from the beginning i found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch.<br /><br />spoiler: the opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process, and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style. the film isn't about the process itself though, it concerns charles darwin's struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter and his search for truth.<br /><br />the appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has "killed god". the daughter is an adult, making adult comments about his work and torturing darwin with personal doubts. was he in some way responsible for her death? husband and wife in real life paul bettany and jennifer connelly give truly wonderful performances as charles and emma darwin, as does martha west as annie. bettany's size and awkward gait give darwin's character a genuine sense of reality, whilst connelly seems very comfortable with her english accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona.<br /><br />it's easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides. the grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed. science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didn't cost him his life, as it did with so many earlier men and women, science put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. this film portrays that barrier supremely well.<br /><br />i give creation ten stars, because i think it's beautiful, profound, superbly well acted and a genuine, no-extraneous-frills-required look at one of the world's true geniuses.<br /><br />what seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone... see bill maher's wonderful "religulous") was hidden for millennia. the truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. creation examines that pain, and the realisation that we are all that we possess.<br /><br />a wonderful cinematic experience.
