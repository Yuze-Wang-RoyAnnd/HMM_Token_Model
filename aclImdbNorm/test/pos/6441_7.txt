this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never forgot. it is certainly not the best movie ever made, but there is something very special about it that i can't quite put my finger on. i love it. i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy. <br /><br />exactly what/who is that mysterious witch-lady and what is her relationship with tom? why and how did he become a water baby ... why was he raised on the earth? it is questions like these that are just eating at me! i thought if i read the book i would get answers, but i just read an article that the book from which this story is "based" is a lot different. so i guess i'll never know what the writer was thinking! <br /><br />i still love this movie though and i recently watched it with my two year old niece. she loves it too although she insists on calling it "baby water" for reasons unknown to me. she loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares "i'm all clean." (you have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world!) we watched that scene over and over. <br /><br />i am so glad that we can enjoy this film together! there should be more films like this. (but what is up with the gay seahorse??!!)
