i am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing jimmy page on led zeppelin ii. while i don't play in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been huge. now, nearly 20 years later i finally got to see something more than the not-so-good the song remains the same. again, i have seen so many bands perform, some small - some the current 'masters.' no band, no where, no way has ever been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this dvd. <br /><br />robert plant can be a bit much at times, and you can nearly sense page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics, but that didn't matter i guess - especially for the era. bonham's genius shines more on this dvd then on any album with zeppelin, the band of joy or lord sutch. jpj is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this dvd is how well the four of them perform together. the world loved to imagine that they were into black magic(k) etc. - that was only a matter of interest to page. the magic (notice i say this a lot), is that this dvd captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are actually playing. it didn't matter. <br /><br />a quick breakdown. the first of the two dvd's is where the true magic is. you should be able to sense the power and rawness zep had in their early days. by the end of the second dvd page is struggling with his sanity during the knebworth songs. (it's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin). so, i'd recommend the first disk to any music lover, and the second for the only true zeppelin fan.<br /><br />i may be going too far here for some guitarists, but i would say after watching this, page is certainly more creative and inventive than hendrix. yup, i said it. and if you disagree - watch the dvd.
