i saw the original rough screen showing 4 times at gencon a couple years ago. i was delighted to have done so, my daughter is in the movie.<br /><br />i stood in the back of the room with her watching the much younger fans sit on the edge of there seats, dead quiet no wanting to miss a line. the standing ovation afterward's was like watching the fans when the usa hockey team beat the russians at the olympic games in montreal.<br /><br />i love excellent comedy and sight gags. taxi, barney miller, cheers, frasier and married with chilren are my all time favorite comedy shows. lesser shows i will not even watch.<br /><br />this movie will do for gamers what animal house did for college frat days, what dodge ball did for weird sports. forget the lack of a mega budget backing the production. this is pure art, it's that good.<br /><br />i could not be happier for the entire cast and production company.
