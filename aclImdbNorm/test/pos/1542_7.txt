rachel and chuck yoman (valerie harper, gerald mcraney), decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed up their reluctant son (gregory togel) and daughter (tammy lauren) and moved back to a lake like the one rachel lived at as a child.<br /><br />they say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a mayberry feel. later the residence seems to be more like the people in deliverance. soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces. this does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods.<br /><br />we find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get ax-cepted as the antagonists. <br /><br />can the ignored young stevie save his parents or will their pursuer(s) put his/her foot in it?<br /><br />this film is more than most parodies as it was played with strait faces. they could not have chosen better actors and daryl anderson was exceptionally creepy. an added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out, instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact. anyway this made for tv movie is good for a few laughs.
