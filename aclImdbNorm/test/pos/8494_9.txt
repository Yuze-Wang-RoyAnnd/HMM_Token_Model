taylor hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years, and finally found jamie foxx to play the title role. foxx is amazing in his portrayal of ray charles. from an interview i saw with foxx, he met charles several times and the two of them also played piano together (foxx had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes). i didn't see charles live until his later years, so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed. i hope foxx gets nominated for the best actor oscar as he certainly deserves it. the music, also, is incredible - it really showcases the breadth of charles' music, from country to blues, and everything in between. the movie also gives an unblemished account of ray charles' life, from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that.
