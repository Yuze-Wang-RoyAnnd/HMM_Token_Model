this is first of all a good, exciting story, with well developed characters. but all the other details are well crafted on top of that, leading to a wonderful film. don't let the disney label lead you to think this is dumbed-down or only for kids -- it has a lot to offer to all ages, whether you like golf or not. one of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting. and speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on tv, this is no small feat.<br /><br />the first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds, enough that you end up liking all the important competitors once the pivotal match begins halfway through. sure, you root for ouimet's character all along, but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right. the background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf clubs, since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses.<br /><br />the computer effects are flashy, but they do help the story more often than not. the directing has all sorts of clever golf shots, and the period costumes and sets are really top notch.<br /><br />there are a few small quibbles -- many of the minor characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from the class warfare mold, but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn.<br /><br />shia laboeuf playing francis ouimet is, as usual, callow and sympathetic. but the real standout is steven dillane, playing harry vardon. he rarely moves his face, but his intense, often sad, eyes and minor changes of expression say so much.<br /><br />ouimet's caddy eddie lowery, played by josh flitter, steals the scenes he is in. after you see the film, google to find the actual photograph of ouimet and lowery at the tournament, to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was.
