the polish brothers are unique film artists, and they've really pushed the envelope here. a fantasy that has points in common with "wings of desire," "northfork" tells the story of a '50s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the u.s. government's desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands. it's a wry parable about loss and remembrance, featuring angels, dreams, premonitions, and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since "repo man." the performances are all outstanding, especially nolte and woods. i've noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics, and i want to say, that's one of the things that makes this film so great: its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. david mullen's cinematography is stunning. highly recommended; if you've suffered a meaningful personal loss, such as the death of a parent, i would even call this film necessary viewing. - ray
