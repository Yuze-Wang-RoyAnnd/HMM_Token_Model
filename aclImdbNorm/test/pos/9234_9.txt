this is a very funny movie. there is a self deprecating, iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing. the characters are interesting. the movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour, 50 minutes duration of the film. the film quality is not of the highest hollywood standards; however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punk-rock style. the documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow. the original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie. the interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film, the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenix-like rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film. in my mind the documentary (a texas tale of treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film (waldos hawiian vacation) would have ever been. two thumbs up for a job well done.
