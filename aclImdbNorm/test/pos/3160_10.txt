the whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are "blue". the blue state mentality. this is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (the usa). it doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a us citizen gets just by being a us citizen. <br /><br />but i'm so sick of bitching about this. it doesn't do any good. i haven't taken much action lately and i wonder how many people have. maybe i'm just down because my job was "outsourced" last month and now i'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to india and other places overseas. i'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war. these days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there "patriotism". anyway, back to this review: usa the movie is an obscure dvd that makes me realize that some people have taken action, whether it's through politics, protesting or arts or media. the filmmaker is obviously passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go outside the norm, frustrated, unique, astute etc. <br /><br />i looked through the whole site that's linked to the dvd and got lost in all the articles, essays etc.that are there. the dvd does that too, has references to different times, views and historical points. sometimes someone does something out there.
