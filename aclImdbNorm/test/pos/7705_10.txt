"dope sick love" is a really remarkable documentary made for hbo about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of nyc. i managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing. there is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects, the camera just follows them around, like a third eye, completely detached. the people being followed don't even seem aware that they're being filmed! (or, at least, they don't seem to care). the footage is amazingly candid. some of the most candid i've ever seen. this is as real as it gets. the nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. we watch them score dope, shoot it, make up, hustle, and even impersonate cops to rob people, and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave out.<br /><br />some of the footage is truly horrifying. like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost. i found myself praying that he would find it, just so that his misery would temporarily end. and when he does find it, the guy literally dances in the street.<br /><br />the cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this. everything is about getting the next score to these folks, yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through. <br /><br />i would love to get a copy of this, if anyone knows where it is available. highly recommended, if you can catch it on hbo.
