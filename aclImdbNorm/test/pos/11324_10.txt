i just wanted to say that when i was young my favorite t.v show back in the day was night heat. i loved the characters and the plot of the show. i thought that it was an excellent show and still do to this day. i enjoy watching the reruns and i am a big fan.i love the way the characters played off one another.i would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who also was a big fan. now i can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song.which i thought was a cool song for the show.my favorite characters were scott hylands and jeff wincott.i enjoyed watching these handsome guys take down the bad boys.
