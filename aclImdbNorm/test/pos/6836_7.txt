this movie was a pleasant surprise for me. in all honesty, the previews looked horrible, up until the point where emma thompson and alan rickman appeared. so i rented it with reservation, but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. it had great acting, a few good plot twists, and, of course, emma thompson and alan rickman. it's definitely worth checking out.
