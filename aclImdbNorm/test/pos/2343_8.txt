have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. here's hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. perhaps overall the movie is a little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. good for the actors i am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot. may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors,
