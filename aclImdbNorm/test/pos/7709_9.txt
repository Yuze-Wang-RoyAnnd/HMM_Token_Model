film noir meets anime... brilliant! this was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative animatrix shorts. this was one of my favorites if not my favorite (i also loved world record). this is basically a reference to those classic film noir detective stories and movies of the 40s, except it's animated and involves the matrix. but by being animated, it is able to take the extreme camera angles, the detective life style, the shadows, and everything film noir to an entirely new level. the femme fatale? trinity. the detective in this story seems to be living in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black walks into his office...<br /><br />my grade: 9/10
