separate lies is such an elegant, intelligent and thought provoking film and i could have watched tom wilkinson forever on the screen. the locations in the english countryside, the marvelous london locations, the interiors, smart wardrobes and of course, the writing and dialog made separate lies a thrilling adventure.<br /><br />with that said, and perhaps this is just an american viewpoint, as the british are so much more sophisticated in handling sexual escapades, i found it hard to watch tom wilkinson just stand by, as his wife goes merrily on her way in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy, creates much despair for her husband, with the cad that is rupert everett. yes, i saw the failings of wilkinson's character-his aim for perfection, the desire for everything in its place-but in emily watson, she should have looked deeper into his true character and solid goodness, to realize what she has thrown away.<br /><br />tom wilkinson makes separate lies into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain, embarrassment, and despair on the screen as his wife goes off with another man. and he himself makes the journey in separate lies by understanding his faults, embracing his wife, despite all that has gone on, and leading her back to london. bravo, tom!
