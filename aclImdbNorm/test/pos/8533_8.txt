on monday, earlier this week, sometime in july, i happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and me being a horror fan, wanted to see something scary. i was thinking of the ammityville horror 2, but i got something way better. i was at my friend's house, and he had the vhs evil ed. no cover or anything, he didn't even see the whole thing himself, but he told me it was about "a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people." well, this movie was very shocking,i've never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie, it buries ted bundy and ed gein both! it is pretty funny too, with references to the evil dead trilogy( and plus the evil dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) the movie is about edward, a obsessive-compulsive, nice guy, who happens to be a film editor. he is then lent to another department in the building, and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of sam campbell, the splatter and gore department. sam campbell, eddy's new boss, is telling eddy about the big break on his movies, the gruesome loose limbs series, and he needs eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over europe. eddy has his regrets soon, as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in, and then, what happens from there is truly nightmarish. imagine yourself in his place! the acting is great, the overdubbing is little funny (sam campbell's voice is often found funny, same with the other actors). however, the overdubbing job was done pretty good, i give this movie a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the gore sub-genre to horror. very good, nightmarish, bloody.......you just have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />quote from movie: "where in the f**k is my beaver rape scene?!"
