i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival, which, as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema. <br /><br />i have been keen on australian film for a number of years, so was pleased to learn that this film was included, and i was certainly not disappointed. <br /><br />superbly shot, firmly directed, it's an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness, as it were. it reminded me a tad of lynch's wild at heart, it has that strange madness in it, but i was glued to the movie for other reasons - namely that it presents a portrait of australia which is..well, very believable.<br /><br />i have vacationed to the land down under a number of times, once in the 1980's and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /><br />i don't wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations, but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia, a country that is responsible for the extremities of, say, nick cave on one hand, and steve irwin (the 'crocodile hunter') on the other.<br /><br />one incy wincy whinge - - i would have preferred even more of the 'unknown' australia. much more in fact. but i also realise that there's only 1 and a half hours to do it all in... 'sigh.'<br /><br />overall though, this movie is very, very accomplished.
