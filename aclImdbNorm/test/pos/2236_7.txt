this was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well. the idea about mercy (won't spoil) was original also. i think angelina did a good job as one of her first movies. the only things i frowned upon were some of the corny fight scenes (won't spoil either). i liked the first movie and i liked this one as well. 7/10
