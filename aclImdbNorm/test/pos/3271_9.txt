"two hands" is a good addition to the australian film catalogue.<br /><br />it is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the australians have developed on their own.<br /><br />heath ledger is basically a good if naive guy. wanting to get on he falls in with a local "big" man pando (bryan brown). but at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets alex (rose byrne). here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected. after getting on the wrong side of pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film. yes, jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it. although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.<br /><br />heath ledger is excellent as jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, rose is hypnotic as alex and bryan is marvellous as usual. this is a small ensemble of characters are believable and i found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.<br /><br />this dvd is usually in the cheap aisle so i would recommend adding it too your dvd collection, it would be money well spent.<br /><br />8 out of 10
