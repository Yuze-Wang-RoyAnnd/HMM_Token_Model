the reason i am reviewing this is that the previous review, was written by someone who walked out of this film, not even half way through. unfortunately for him, he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty. agreed the film was very slow to start, in fact the friend i was with fell asleep briefly,i woke him before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love, drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60s. fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel. be patient, like many great films its well worth the wait, and is certainly a film that i will look forward to revisiting! 8/10
