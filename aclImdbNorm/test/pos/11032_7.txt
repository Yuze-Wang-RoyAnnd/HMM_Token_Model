i remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my dad took me my brother & sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england. i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know.the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.
