with "anatomy" the german film producers have tried to make something totally new. usually there just drama or comedy movies - in the horror genre is(or was) totally new at that time.<br /><br />the story's also new and shocking. franka potente plays her role brilliant and i bet you won't find out who's the murderer. it's possible, but difficult. a really great movie with a lot of talented actors.
