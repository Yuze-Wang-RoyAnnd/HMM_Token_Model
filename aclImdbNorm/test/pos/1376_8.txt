i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me, and i couldn't put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!!!<br /><br />the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent, a 'escape pod', a few guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a 'scanner' thing. that is it for props. maybe this is even a good thing, forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film, as the centers of the work, instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make cgi fights (starwars).<br /><br />the cgi is fine. it is not exactly 'seamless'... but imho it still works. why? because there isn't too much of it, and what there is, is not 'taking over' with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot. it prompts the imagination... it's some relatively simple stuff, with decent composition (especially the heavy freighter shot.. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds...that tracks the entire length of the ship... it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years, to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0.75 seconds), and some relation to the story. it might look old or not 'state of the art', but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story.<br /><br />the acting is good, except the characters die too fast to get to know them. the captain was great, but a few of his scenes could have used another take. i also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse, i like to think captains are calm cool and in control... what was going on in that scene? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment? did he feel himself losing control? <br /><br />now, as for the plot.... mostly it is good... why? because it doesn't try to explain itself. it just happens. it's called 'the planet', its a mystery, get it?? nobody knows why there is a statue, and they don't find out either. the mysterious cult? the weird scientist with the tattoo? what do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes? this isn't war and peace. and, thank god, it's not star wars/trek either. no midichlorians, no 5 minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story. the characters are stranded, and are only able to figure out a few basic things... it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer. it is mysterious, and i liked that. i don't know why, maybe i can identify with these guys more , since they don't know whats happening, and i don't either... they don't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening. <br /><br />in fact, i would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the 'traitor' turns on the crew, and tries to 'explain' the reason for the planet, the cult, etc. this coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog, imho, in the whole movie, and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene. <br /><br />ok, sometimes i felt it was a little too mysterious, though. like, why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning? that was odd. just weird. the 'hamlet' ending... again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better. and would it have been so hard to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end? this is not a serial show, it was a film, and we like closure in films, even if they can have a sequel. imagine hamlet with no 'flights of angels sing thee to thy rest'<br /><br />anyways. what can i say. this was well worth the dollar i payed at the 'red box' machine at the supermarket. it was also, imho, a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts 1 2 or 3. like i said, it sucked me in, wanting to know what was happening, and i couldn't stop watching until the end.
