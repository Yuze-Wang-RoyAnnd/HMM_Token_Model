i saw the film and am very pleased to see a film so different in character and story to the stupid,mainstream american major productions. its a film with a background interesting for young as much as all age- groups. contrary to certain reviews the audience seems to split my evaluation as the film is very successful wherever yet exploited worldwide. for example in netherlands is was ranked number 3 . negative statements must be respected but one should expect such to be guided on a fact basis. if you have the chance view the film and enjoy it.
