"who do you dream of? hoot gibson ... howdy doody? i'm talking about the *theater*!" [harry crystal]<br /><br />nothing beats a great stage show ... nothing! and harry crystal lives that belief. a stage actor still waiting for his big break, harry brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to artie shoemaker (tom hulce) ... a young man who has big dreams (but just didn't know it until he met harry).<br /><br />with scenes and songs from many of america's classic musicals ... those lips, those eyes conveys both the ups and downs of the people that, for 2 hours, take us to a fantasy land, but who manage to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long!<br /><br />like artie ... once you've seen those lips, those eyes ... "you're hooked, kid!" [harry crystal]
