good movie, all elements of a good movie was there, story, actors, script, and direction. i was on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br /><br />no question about it, is a low budget film, but i liked it more than many big budget films.<br /><br />andres bagg plays martin sanders, who is dealing with his unfaithful wife. then a voice in the telephone and then just fear.<br /><br />virginia lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance. she is an excellent part to the film.<br /><br />i liked the increasing ambiguity near the end, even though we know that the main character can be involved, we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking: who is the killer?
