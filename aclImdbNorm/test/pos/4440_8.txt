my impression, having seen this documentary, is that nathaniel kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. <br /><br />he took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. i can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. <br /><br />his father, the renowned architect louis kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. but like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity. <br /><br />one of his mistresses said he was "accessible" but that is never explored. other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate. a pity. <br /><br />the tension between the three half-siblings in the room of a home louis designed is also palpable. the unsaid hovers over the conversation. the only tracks that his father left were in the buildings he left behind, some great, some not so great. <br /><br />i was captivated by the music ship and the salk institute. saddened by the baby mothers who got caught forever by his callous impregnations never more exemplified than what he said to the director's mother upon being told of her pregnancy - "not again!" <br /><br />8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. <br /><br />it appears, in this case at least, the son is not the father of the man.
