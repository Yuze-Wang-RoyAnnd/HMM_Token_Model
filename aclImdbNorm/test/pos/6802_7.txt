this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child. it is good to remember it. the girl, liz taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney. the content of the film plot is good for all ages, good wills and behavior. good ethics of velvet's parents, particularly her mother is something to take into account. our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose. velvet loves the horses and racing them, and mi taylor (rooney) brought her to an international horse racing competition in england, where at the end the young velvet won, but was disqualified because of being female.
