"best in show" is a often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event. the only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in "best in show" act more sane than their owners! funny stuff from a top-notch cast that includes eugene levy (who co-wrote the film), catherine o'hara, parker posey, michael mckean, jennifer coolidge, jane lynch, and christopher guest (who co-wrote with levy and directed). they're all funny, but fred willard steals the movie with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things. plus the dogs are cute too. "best in show" isn't exactly the laugh riot that i expected, but there are laughs and it's worth seeing.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
