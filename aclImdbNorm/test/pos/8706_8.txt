i watched this on sky tv late one night, as i am a vampire fan. i must admit i half expected it to be a b-movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong.<br /><br />subspecies is about a family of vampires. when a vampire lord dies, his two sons, the handsome and noble stefan, and his brother, the evil, hideous radu start a war with each other over their birth right, the bloodstone. the bloodstone is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it bleeds the blood of saints, which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high.<br /><br />the fight for the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the brothers' territory on a school trip and stefan has to protect them from his brothers lusts.<br /><br />like, i said, i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen. the sets and locations (romania i think, been a while since i've seen it) are very nice and the music score did the film justice.<br /><br />most of the acting was adequate, but its anders hove as the evil radu that steals the movie (and all the subsequent sequels). hove's performance as the twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and bumps the film simply from okay, to pretty d@mn good!
