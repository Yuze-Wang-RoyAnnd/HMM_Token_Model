i found the episodes to be fascinating and well written. as a tv show, it was entertaining which is what i expect from fictional entertainment. i like the "relationship" between the professor and his female security guard ... although sometimes her scottish accent makes it a bit difficult to understand what she is saying. i was hoping that there would be more than just four episodes. i recognize that one commenter/reviewer of this series had comments relating to his opinion as a physician. i understand this gentleman's comments; however, this is a fictional television series which is meant to entertain ... not present precise facts like a documentary. patrick stewart performs well and makes his character believable. if you want to watch a documentary, then this is not the series for you. but if you want to watch unique scientific-based theories in an entertainment-based medium, then you will enjoy the four episodes.
