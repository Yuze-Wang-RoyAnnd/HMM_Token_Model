these cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. the first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: "alka-fizz prison - no noose is good noose." inside the prison, the first sign we see is "welcome: have a seat." they then show an electric chair.<br /><br />corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. with pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it! in no time, he has criss-crossed the united states, zipped up through canada and is in the northern part of that country. it's there we see the canadian royal mounted police and, of course, our hero droopy, known here as "sgt. mcpoodle." he has the assignment of catching the at-large criminal from alka-fizz. so, with his trusty little blue horse, he goes out in the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf.<br /><br />from that point, we get the normal story: droopy always being a step ahead of the wolf, no matter what the latter does....and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny sight gags. droopy even pops out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. there is nowhere the wolf can go - or do (plastic surgery!) to escape the intrepid "sgt. mcpoodle." nobody, by the way, in the history of cartoons perhaps has more exaggerated reactions, either, than this wolf each time he sees his nemesis! his screams, facial and body stretched out in horror each time is a big part of the sight gags. <br /><br />you'd think this one-joke cartoon would get monotonous but it doesn't. it's more good stuff from tex avery and the gang, just one of 24 cartoons in the "complete theatrical collection" dvd with wonderful-looking restored visuals.
