my dinner with jimi is a glimpse at howard kaylan's giddy and vertiginous ride to fame with his 60's folk-rock band, the turtles. the turtles were kind of a 'second tier' act during the sixties, but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat, drink, and party with the titans of hippie culture. and, not only that, they had the musical chops to back it up. many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as they interact with the band at work and at play. this provides my only complaint about the film. almost from the beginning of the movie, one sees that it is nearly impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate such recognizable stars. too often during the film, i felt that i was watching an engaging exhibition of phony wigs and mustaches. but, if you are a fan of the music of the turtles, or the swinging 60's, in general-this might be the film for you. and, don't forget to view the extras. there is a very funny (and informative) bit by band members, mark volman and howard kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.
