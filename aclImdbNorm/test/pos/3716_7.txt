pierre jolivet plays a don quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. he trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. just as don quixote rode rocicante, "the man" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world. both characters are guardian knights of values unfamiliar to most of the other characters in the story.<br /><br />unlike cervantes's tale, in this movie we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. we can only compare this alien and forbidding landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in. our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers. our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph, to vanquish, to change his world (for the better) back into a world of plenty that no longer exists.<br /><br />we look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humans-as-animals. don quixote considered himself a true knight among animals.<br /><br />with cervantes's tale we can only see the dreamer, without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement. in besson's and jolivet's tale we see the new world from the eyes of don quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the crusading main character.
