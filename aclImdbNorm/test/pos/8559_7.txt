h.o.t.s. is not for those that want hardcore porn. instead, this film is a precursor to many 80s era cult-classic college/frat films like revenge of the nerds and porky's and a post-cursor to the world-renown animal house. a good time if you dig a lot of big-titted 70s/80s playboy type chicks and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing too notable if you wanna use it as whack-material...<br /><br />h.o.t.s. is an "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts doing battle against the popular and trendy pi girls. this one has pranks, an aunt jemima-ish house keeper, and even an over-heated robot that makes it relatively fun viewing if boobies are your "thing"...<br /><br />well...i like tits as much (or probably more...) as the next guy - but with all the sleazy sh!t that i've seen, i couldn't help but wish for a few hardcore scenes to make this one truly worthwhile. i knew it wouldn't happen, but i still wish that h.o.t.s. had a bit more sex and a bit less cheeze. not quite as notable as nerds, porky's, or animal house, but worth a look for fans of those types of films...7/10<br /><br />p.s... and i forgot - this one has consummate douche-rag danny bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside of his "reality show"...
