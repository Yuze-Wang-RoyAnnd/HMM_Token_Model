let me start by saying overall i enjoyed the long kiss goodnight. i would give it a 7/10. the good: 1. acting: samuel l jackson is entertaining in almost any role. in this movie he doesn't play his usual character, the type that is in control, instead geena davis is in control and sam is along for the ride. his timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie. geena davis also gives a great preformance as samantha caine/charlie baltimore. she is a believable action hero and i don't think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance geena does. 2. the action: this is a very action packed movie. things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else. the special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old. i can see some green screen stuff but it doesn't detract too much from the acting.<br /><br />the bad: 1. why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot? this film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didn't run as long as it did. maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it. i think that if you can stick out the first half you will be pleseantly suprized the second half. 2. geena davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold. 3. some things are unrealistic. sam jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up. when you see this part you will think it's a gag. overall fun movie 7/10
