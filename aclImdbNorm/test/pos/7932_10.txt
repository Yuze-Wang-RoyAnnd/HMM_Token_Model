i learned much from previous viewer reactions. is there one that does not mention 'propaganda'? too glib. 'perception is concept dependent'. i love fred astaire musicals, the great, great songs, & fred's peerless grace. but comrades, if you see idle, brainless, rich parasites dancing on the downtrodden & unemployed, that's a valid criticism of 'capitalist propaganda'. any movie is steeped in the values of its time & place, not to mention those who fund it
