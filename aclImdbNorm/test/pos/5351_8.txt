this was very good, except for two things which i'll mention at the end. the animation is great, highlighted by nick park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. the color was magnificent, too.<br /><br />the best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. this is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags. it's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball "wallace" and his silent-and-smart dog "gromit." along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in "best of show."<br /><br />my only complaints were two typical traits of today's films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone. those aside, this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times.
