it's not surprising that the majority of higher-rated votes were submitted by females aged 45+. this is the timeframe in women's lives when they become the caretakers of aged and ill parents. i lost my mother, from complications of cancer, in june, and went through most of the same emotions portrayed by zellweger in this film. yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and the plot development extremely accurate. kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death, and the promises of tomorrow.
