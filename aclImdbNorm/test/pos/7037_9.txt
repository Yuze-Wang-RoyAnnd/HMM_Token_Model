i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones. we'd stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other.<br /><br />we called one of our mates "zipmole watkins" after the brilliant episode in which daniel peacock has a bit of 'restyling' on his nose by the back street abortionist.<br /><br />lots of great lines "remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. take it easy guy!" - gandhi as a local shopkeeper.<br /><br />tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph (daniel peacock) to be a barman "it's no good amanda i'll never make it as a bar man" helen lederer teaches him to ask people about the match "see the match last night? i thought woodcock played well" after a string of failed conversations the curly haired arsenal star was sitting at the bar: "see the match last night?" "yeah. i thought i played well"<br /><br />we still do odd stupid lines now - "reg and ralph..... or....... ralph and reg. reg, reg... reg reg reg reg"<br /><br />lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the flatlets - the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line - "and he'll mark your packages 'return to sender"<br /><br />good old danny peacock - you added a lot to some young drinkers' evenings sir.<br /><br />**update - i found a couple of episodes on tape - i'm going to upload the gandhi sketch to youtube **
