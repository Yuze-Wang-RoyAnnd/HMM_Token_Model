isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. "la pianiste" truly confirms it. as if that wasn't enough, annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. so, as you may well imagine, those pieces of casting are worth the horror we're put through. isabelle and annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen. a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath. personally, i don't believe in the director's intentions, i don't believe they (the intentions that is) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of girardot's strength. i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me, you can't afford to miss "la pianiste"
