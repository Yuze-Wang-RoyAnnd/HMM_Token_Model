existenz combines director david cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting david lynch film. and it actually works effectively. i won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion. all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. the film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end, but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue.<br /><br />there's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the 'bio-ports' in the protagonists backs, as well as some very gross acting from jude law. he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of. jason jennifer leigh comes off much better, and everyone else can be called a supporting character, including willem dafoe in a functional, if unspectacular, role as a money-crazed mechanic. overall, existenz is a very effective sci-fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.
