well, first of all, it's not a bad movie. it is good, and i like the characters introduced. i also like lady and tramp's voices more in this.<br /><br />however, i would like to see lady and tramp more. i know it says 'scamp's adventure', and i love scamp and angel to bits, but it's a sequel to the original, where in my opinion, they should of just released it as 'scamp's adventure', not 'lady and the tramp ii:scamp's adventure'.<br /><br />tramp did have quite a role, but he didn't have much time with lady.<br /><br />but anyway, the songs are quite good, and scamp and angel are sweet. i've seen better sequels, but hey, it's not a failure.<br /><br />i give it 7/10. very good, but still had flaws.
