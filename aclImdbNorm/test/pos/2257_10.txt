i thought this movie was amazing. i was a bit skeptical since i really had no idea what it was about, but it was beautiful story. i cried a lot and i also laughed out loud.<br /><br />i think it is very important that there are movies being created that are about the holocaust and how it affects people (it only happened 60 years ago!) i have been to germany and eastern europe and i have studied the holocaust, so this film meant a lot to me. i think this film did an amazing job capturing this story (i wont go into detail, i do not want to spoil it) but i definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that, i know this may sound clich'e', but will change your mindset on things.
