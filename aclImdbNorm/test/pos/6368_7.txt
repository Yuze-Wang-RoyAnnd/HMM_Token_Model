i am surprised that this, well above average 80's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all the imdb voters. dan ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician. he retreats to california to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous dr lawrence baird. the only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest (walter matthau) who comes along to be pampered by ackroyd's new found wealth having blakmailed him. charles grodin throws in a good supporting performance too. for its genre i think this film deserves the same crediblity as 'ferris bueller' or 'trading places'. 7.5 / 10
