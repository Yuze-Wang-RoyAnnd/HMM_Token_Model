this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it, and its decidedly above-average for its genre. it was nicely drawn, too, with some great angles, good detail and....well, lots of interesting sights.<br /><br />what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat, with two guys on it. (incidentally, why were the "japs" always pictured with big, round glasses and bucked teeth?). <br /><br />anyway, these harmless-looking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty. oh, boy, thinks the gullible popeye, "wait until the admiral sees this!" in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above, we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyer.....and popeye is in deep....um, water! "why, you double-crossing ja-pansies!," yells our sailor man.<br /><br />how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch.
