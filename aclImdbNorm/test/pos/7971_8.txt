a tremendous action movie that i have ever seen. it was the first expression that i uttered after watching it twice on the local tv in my country, indonesia. a combination between a constant shooting and a great fighting choreography played well by david bradley. he was good here besides "american samurai". his skill in martial art was performed above average. he succeeded to make the fighting scenes nice to watch. not only punching and kicking like what most of martial artists show in their movies. david bradley could utilize all the martial arts techniques such as throwing, smashing and kicking. very recommended for action fans.i have tried to look for the dvd but i still cannot get it particularly in my town. anyone could help me?
