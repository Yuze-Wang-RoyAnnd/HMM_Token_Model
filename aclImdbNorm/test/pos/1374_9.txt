got this the other day from the creators on dvd. i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel, had never heard anything about it. after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it. i used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in aberdeen.<br /><br />1st off im not a big sci-fi fan (baring star wars) i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location, i was presently surprised. this didn't turn out to be a standard sci-fi, more like a mix of sci-fi and survival horror.<br /><br />had a good storyline, which was different, had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with lb8000. acting was better than average for a low budget film. the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nice.<br /><br />weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe mode.<br /><br />all in all i will buy any future releases from these guys, maybe a all out horror next (hint hint). the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers, i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd release.<br /><br />excellent work keep it up
