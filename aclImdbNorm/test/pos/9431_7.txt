not too bad entry in the series, heavily ladled with war propaganda, but rathbone & bruce's sincerity keep me happy.<br /><br />it's a rather fantastic story from start to finish, just how many mcguffin's are there? holmes (and moriarty independently) reeling out the dancing men code uncoded so fast was amazing watson - so why weren't you amazed! the post explaining the bomb-sight/enlarger tickled me, it was just the kind of cheap trick universal would play - once again reminding me that they didn't expect people to be critically watching this over 60 years later. this (and i think every other potboiler from universal at this period) were meant to be viewed the once or twice and forgotten. they perhaps should have realised that basically people don't change, that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now (2005) and tightened up on the script and sets!<br /><br />lionel atwill was going through his hollywood rape court case at about this time, i wonder if it was that or particularly effective make-up that made him look so haggard as moriarty?<br /><br />the important thing about sw though is that this was the first holmes film roy william neill directed, i think he directed all of the rest and produced all but one, thus establishing a marvellous ambient continuity.
