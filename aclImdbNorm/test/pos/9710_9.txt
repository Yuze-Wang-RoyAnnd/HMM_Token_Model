yes. bam cried a couple times and so did englund. and most probably you will too. the whole cast is back in action and knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed-up retards (i mean this in the best possible way). i first thought, maybe bam or steve-o were the main go-to guys....nope, the main man is now johnny. don't get me wrong, everybody, and i mean everybody is great in this flick! right from the get-go you're laughing, and believe you me, don't plan on resting that smile of yours. i personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first. you know when you go into a theater, and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it.....well, this movie blows all expectations away. if you love jackass, you can go into this with gigantic expectations. no matter what you'll laugh your ass off. if you're not laughing, the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating jack sh!t for breakfast and jack left town. all i have to say is, prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie. :)
