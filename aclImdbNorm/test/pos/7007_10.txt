from the first 10 seconds of pitch black i was hooked. i had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci-fi movie. instead i found a highly entertaining, on the edge of your seat, thought provoking action film. the movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick. the actors are amazing, radah mitchell (high art, love and other..) as fry is truly a joy to watch on screen, while vin diesel as riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again.<br /><br />the look of the movie is breath taking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing. followed by the complete darkness of nightfall. i would truly recommend any lover of the alien movies or radha mitchell (which is why i went to see it) to check out this film. i'm sure by the end you'll look at the dark in a whole new way.
