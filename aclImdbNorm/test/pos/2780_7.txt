i forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to barcelona and being disappointed when they don't have quite such an exciting time.<br /><br />the movie was enjoyable. it's of course always a pleasure to see audrey tatou.<br /><br />however, i have a very strong issue with part of the movie. the lesbian roommate tells xavier that women like to be physically dominated (which i take issue with) and shows him some sort of butt-grabbing move that's guaranteed to get a woman. xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend - who starts out saying "no no" "i'm married, i'm married" but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab?? all of a sudden she's moaning "yes yes" and they're going at it on the benches in parc guell. i found this really really offensive. furthermore it is very stereotyped. how often have we seen scenes where the woman says "no" but obviously doesn't mean it? no means no. grabbing butts/physical domination isn't going to make it right. it just totally supported the stereotypical rape myths.<br /><br />i wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand "suck it, slut" (or something like that). did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go?<br /><br />this section really ruined the movie for me.
