i have been a huge errol morris fan ever since i saw thin blue line and heard it saved a life. to date, this movie is his best piece of work.<br /><br />the plot is a mixing of stephen hawking's book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. the story is told through interviews with family, friends, and hawkings himself.<br /><br />don't be fooled; it totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking. the blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. i was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man. tho physically powerless, hawking's greatness and shear brilliance is encapsulated into a real live human being that we are allowed to laugh at and aw over at the same time.<br /><br />find this movie. watch it and enjoy. and if the studio who owns this picture reads this, a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect now...
