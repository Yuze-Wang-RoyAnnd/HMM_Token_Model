i was very surprised to learn that goldie hawn won an oscar for this film. she seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54(!) year old bergman in the scenes where they are side by side. if it had been written today, i think that bergman and the young man ivan would have wound up together (ingrid is so much hotter than goldie...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by matthau and hawn would be left out in the cold. but it was written at the end of 60's and feels like plaza suite or barefoot in the park. however, matthau's one-liners, hawn's innocence and bergman's classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch.
