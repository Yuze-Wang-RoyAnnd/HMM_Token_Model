fast times it ain't. but check this movie out, it has a heart. pour yourself a drink and enjoy. it's loaded with a slew of just-beginning stars. sherilyn fenn has her first on-screen credited cameo. chris penn, lea thompson, eric stotz, jenny wright, rick moranis, etc.--they all look so young. oh and if you look closely the cop's wife is nancy wilson from the rock band heart.
