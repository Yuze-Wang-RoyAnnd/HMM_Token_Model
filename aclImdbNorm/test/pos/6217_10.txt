every episode i saw when i was an innocent child was stupid. there were some funny looking puppets called "the mitts" who would always discuss childhood things. they would play this song before "the mitts" part of the show that goes like this "let's join the mitts..." there was a groucho marx puppet that told jokes. before the session, this man would sing "hot fudge! right on!" there was a green puppet with teeth that was called seymore. we would always see more seymore. he would crack jokes and sing every episode. there was always a moral in every episode. one episode, a man sang "liars are losers!" another episode he was singing about sharing and caring. seymore said tell me about those two little girls "sharon and karen." the hot fudge holey moley part has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird music.
