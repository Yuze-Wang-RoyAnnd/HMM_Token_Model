contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an "against the system" type of movie and attitude. it is an excellent portrayal of the "system" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. the funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. and that is to learn what you enjoy. that is what college should be about..<br /><br />i come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines. i think i have given my opinion on the matter. so i now write a couple more lines just as filler. i hope you have been entertained during this time. i encourage you to go see the movie. it is well worth your while so long as you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie.
