this movie, based on a true story of gerrit wolfaardt, is one of the best films i've seen on race relations in south africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's south africa. i put it in on the scale of american history x as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the aryan doctrine and how the "certain" segments of the christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.<br /><br />it's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today. the violence is well done as to show the severity of gerrit's crimes and greatness of his transformation.<br /><br />one word about jan ellis who played gerrit wolfaardt. he carries you through the darkness of gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. he went to some dark places as an actor and is to be commended on his performance.<br /><br />another standout performance was that of mpho lovinga who plays moses moremi, one victim of gerrit's crimes. he was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance.<br /><br />very good movie to show the teens.
