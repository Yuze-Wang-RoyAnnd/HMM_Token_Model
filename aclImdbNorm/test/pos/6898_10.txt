it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks. this is a great horror-spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances. its laughs are subtle, but plentiful. because there is very little if any cgi, there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects. this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera-man-must-be-sh%#@ing-his-pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so.<br /><br />far more enjoyable than the big-budget re-made garbage being released by hollywood today.<br /><br />see it.
