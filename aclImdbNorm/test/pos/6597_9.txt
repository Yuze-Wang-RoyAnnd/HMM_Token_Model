this movie was awesome. it's a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the early days. it has interviews with skaters such as tony hawk(my idol)=), and stacy peralta to name a couple. dogtown is a so called "ghetto" part of california, where there used to be an amusement park that was torn down. people started riding alongside the dangerous ruins of the park. soon, the zepher surf team was formed. that led to skateboardings first real start in dogtown. the z boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as vert skating. they started it by skating in drained swimming pools. that's just a bit of the story behind it. it even contains rare footage from charlie's angels of stacy peralta making a cameo. i think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. it'll teach you that skateboarding wasn't always popular. even if you are not, buy!
