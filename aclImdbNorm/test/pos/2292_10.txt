i agree with the guy above, it is so funny i understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. go to japan and you will see a different movie after being there. when i met my girlfriends dad, at his home in kanagawa. i swear i felt the same as jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so i give this movie a 10 out 10.<br /><br />i have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to japan next month. one thing that is real good is the ball game scenes. makes me feel like i am there again. this is a must see if you have any interest in japan and baseball. too bad they don't make a sequel. does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it???? need to know so i can win an argumrnt with me japanese ex-wife. thanks
