anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical facility has got to appreciate this film. the plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish. the acting is superb. george c. scott is the brilliant doctor but class a failure as husband, father. diana riggs, a sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s (of the avengers), saves him from himself. the surrounding cast is superb and the dialogue quite entertaining. i think i enjoyed the film more on viewing it the 4th., 5th. or 6th. time because i caught that much more of the richness of the dialogue and the interplay of the characters. well worth seeing again and again. you just won't want to check in to a hospital in the near future.
