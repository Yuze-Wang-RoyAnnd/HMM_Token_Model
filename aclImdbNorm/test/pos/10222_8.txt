for a movie like this, there's always something to follow by in years to come. clive barker, the man who brought "hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-goth, part-mythology, and all horror in-between. "nightbreed" are a bunch of mutants who only come out at night, and roam the place called midian. now a man name boone(craig sheffer) claims to suffer hallucinations he goes to this shrink dr. decker(david croneberg) who "helps" boone with his problems. unaware of this situation, decker claims to be a purist which he's only a hate-monger in disguise. boone however, goes into midian and make the claim that he's one of the mutants there. but a mutant named peloquin(oliver parker) sees boone as meat! his bite however, spares boone so after he is killed by a gauntlet of fire arms, he's one of them now. after being mislead by decker, boone does everything in his power to protect lori(anne bobby) from him. lori saves a mutant from the sun, and in return helps the others as well. i liked the lady mutants one who gives a smoky "kiss of death" and the porcupine woman who dreamed boone show off her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time. i've enjoyed this horror movie all the way, and the rule of it is, never trust a shrink! rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
