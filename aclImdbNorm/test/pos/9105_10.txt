i was lucky enough to win free passes to the sneak preview of pod. let me just tell you, from just the previews i was excited to see it! the movie absolutely rocked! what i really liked about it was the fact that jb was in his element. with other movies like "school of rock," he does namby pamby music for kids and families, but this music is obviously all his.<br /><br />i took my brother and sister with me to see it, and we laughed basically the entire time. there are a couple places where i wonder what the hell they were thinking, because some items are a little disjointed, but for the most part it was great. a lot of the time it didn't seem like a low-budget film, so that is a plus.<br /><br />what i was most surprised about was dave grohl as satan. that is f-ing hilarious! you honestly wouldn't know from seeing the film that that is him.<br /><br />i say that if you are a rock fan and are into jb, kg, and/or tenacious d, go see the film. be prepared for a lot of drug references, a lot of four letter words and some skull shredding rock!
