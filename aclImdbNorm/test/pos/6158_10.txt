along with having minor flaws to it, this film is a masterpiece, and most definitely the best war film i've seen. not the mention it's one of the best films i've seen in all genres. i might have written this for no man's land before, but now i think this one's better. it's very sad in the ending, and i almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film's final. <br /><br />karel's performance as the main character was fascinating although he's supposed to be a rookie considering his age. this film makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you close to it), and makes you hate any kind of war and political bs. the flashbacks to the prison-hospital make the film even more delicious. <br /><br />one tiny flaw about the film is the non-british accents of supposedly british people. most of the british people on screen were actually british, but how about the ones who are supposed to be british and speak with a foreign accent? that really didn't fit into this adorable film. but it's pretty much the only flaw i've noticed. effects could also be a bit better but then again, we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous fx and absolutely nothing else. <br /><br />briefly, this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it. if you want to travel to the czechoslovakia of 40's, and if you want to virtually witness a tremendous amount of emotions at once, this film is for you. if you don't want to do those, this film will make you want to do so.
