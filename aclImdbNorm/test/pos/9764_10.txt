this movie is a sleeper - i've watched every miniseries that was ever on tv, some many times, and this one is the best. wonderfully cast, superbly acted, and the characters are well-developed. helen morse perfectly fits the part of jean paget - strident, in control, sharp, and a bit belligerent. she bounces well off of joe harmon, the cowboy/taciturn/"it'll be okay" sort of guy. i was sorry that the movie didn't stick to the book, in that there was no romantic interest between noel struan and jean paget. for those who don't know, this is taken from a true story about english women marched around malaya for 3 years by the japanese, who indeed did not know what to do with them. very few of them survived. neville shute talked to one of them, and this is her story. this movie deserves to be in everyone's collection who loves wwii stories.
