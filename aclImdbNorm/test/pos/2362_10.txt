two hard-luck but crafty ladies decide to act like havana widows by sailing to cuba to meet & blackmail rich gentlemen...<br /><br />this was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced quite effortlessly during the 1930's. well made & highly enjoyable, depression audiences couldn't seem to get enough of these popular, funny photo dramas.<br /><br />joan blondell & glenda farrell are perfectly cast as the frantic, fast-talking females who will go to great lengths to make a little dishonest dough. although joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes, both gals are as talented & watchable as they are gorgeous.<br /><br />handsome lyle talbot plays joan's persistent suitor, but he's given relatively little to do. chubby, cherubic guy kibbee appears as the girls' intended target. whether awakening to find himself in the wrong bed or being chased across the roof of a cuban hacienda in his long johns, he is equally hilarious. behind him comes a rank of character actors - allen jenkins, frank mchugh, ruth donnelly, hobart cavanaugh, maude eburne, dewey robinson - all equally adept at pleasing the toughest crowd.<br /><br />movie mavens will recognize an uncredited james murray as the suspicious bank teller with the forged check. this very talented actor was pulled out of complete obscurity to star in king vidor's the crowd (1928), one of the silent era's most prestigious films. hopes were high for a great career, but his celebrity faded quickly with sound pictures. after a long string of tiny roles & bit parts, broke & destitute, his life ended in the waters of a new york river in 1936. he was only 35 years old.<br /><br />while never stars of the first rank, joan blondell (1906-1979) & glenda farrell (1904-1971) enlivened scores of films at warner bros. throughout the 1930's, especially the eight in which they appeared together. whether playing gold diggers or working girls, reporters or secretaries, these blonde & brassy ladies were very nearly always a match for whatever leading man was lucky enough to share equal billing alongside them. with a wisecrack or a glance, their characters showed they were ready to take on the world - and any man in it. never as wickedly brazen as paramount's mae west, you always had the feeling that, tough as they were, blondell & farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy. while many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or contrived today, these two lovely ladies are still spirited & sassy.
