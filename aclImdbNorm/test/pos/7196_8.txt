i just managed to find a copy of "mission cleopatra," which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the united states. so far, i have only watched about the first 10 minutes of the film, and i can safely say that i laughed more in those 10 minutes than i did watching the entirety of the *first* live action asterix movie.<br /><br />i am watching the dubbed version, and while the dubbing job is a little disconcerting, i have found the movie to be very funny and true to the book. i see that people on here have said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the subtitled version, that may very well be true, and after i watch the subtitled version (also on my dvd) i may have to come on here and alter my review. as it stands, though, i find it to be a very entertaining movie, and it more than makes up for the mess which they made out of the first movie.
