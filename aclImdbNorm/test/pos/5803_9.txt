this show was so exhausting to watch and there's only two numbers drowned world (substitute for love) and paradise (not for me) were you can sit down and just contemplate it all. the opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling, as madonna enters the stage via a gigantic swarovski crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the huge screens from behind it show images of horses galloping. horses play a role in this show due to madonna falling off one. the infamous scene of madonna on the crucifix is in this show as a huge screen counts to 12 million, the number of how many african children are orphaned due to aids. at the end a website address comes up for anyone interested in donating. we then go into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown. there's an interlude and then the show starts again to the music of i love new york and ray of light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing there funny hand movements. towards the end there's the music number with the song disco inferno mixed in with the song and the dancers make more of there presence known. the ending again is full of energy as the show wraps up to the tunes of lucky star and hung up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end the message "have you confessed?" comes up. the dvd is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus. jonas akerlund did a great job with the footage for this show keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.
