no one said that in "the big trail" and i thought it would be a natural. nevertheless, this was one of the best westerns i have seen and i am a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. the scope and feel of this picture is simply staggering and, as someone mentioned in their comment, it does have the feel of the 3-camera triptych of "napoleon" (1927). nowadays the cost of the production and, especially, the cast of thousands, would be prohibitive, but raoul walsh got it done.<br /><br />the cast was excellent, although john wayne was better when he had no lines and just swaggered around. in particular, tyrone power,sr. was a perfect villain - i had never seen him before and this was his only talking picture. ian keith was a snake, but el brendel is an acquired taste as the comic relief. he can be funny or annoying, but mostly the latter - and he shows up at the most inappropriate times.<br /><br />it is a bit too long and it took a while for the indians to show up, but this is as close to a documentary on manifest destiny and as true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans regardless of genre preference. by the time the settlers got to california i was exhausted.
