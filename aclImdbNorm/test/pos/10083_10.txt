this is a cut above other movies of the genre: genuinely suspenseful, intelligent, brilliantly acted and visually stunning. yes, the plot can be confusing - but that's partly what makes it pack such a punch. watch it twice if you can. you'll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time.<br /><br />don't be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea, a country not too familiar to most western audiences. while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. all of these are handled superbly by lim su-jeong as su-mi, the lead character. also worthy of particular mention is yum jung-ah, who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother. <br /><br />while it has its scary moments, this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it. it's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery. it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end - and possibly beyond!
