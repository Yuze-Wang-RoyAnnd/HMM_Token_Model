holy schnikey! this movie rocks! the duo of chris farley and david spade are great together. my favorite parts are "fat guy in a little coat, oh my gosh, room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come. this movie has a huge cult following, i wonder why, which proves that even eleven years after chris farley's tragic death and he still is popular. he plays tommy which will make you laugh every time you still watch it. he is a great comedian and is missed. mr. spade reminds me of dan akyroid while chris farley reminds me of john belushi. they done more than 2 movies together. this movie is a must buy and should be in every snl fan's collection.
