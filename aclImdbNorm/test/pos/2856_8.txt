betty sizemore (renee zellweger) lives her life through soap opera "a reason to love" as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life. after a shocking incident involving two hit men (morgan freeman and chris rock), betty goes into shock and travels to la, believing that she is destined to marry the show's main character (greg kinnear).<br /><br />nurse betty is that rare thing, a lesser known film with an all-star cast and a fluffy rom-com plot that surprises with it's terrific script and spot on acting. indeed, such a plot makes one question the r rating, but it's warranted all right. the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light, amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie, but at the same time it is necessary to believably show betty's transformation into the doe eyed, lovable nut job she becomes.<br /><br />as we go along with betty on her journey, director neil labute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error. an example of this would be betty's first meeting with her crush. she pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show. even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, betty's emotional perspective. we almost believe what she is saying, yet we understand that her mind is fractured. whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene, labute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding.<br /><br />the banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless, the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of. freeman in particular is excellent as always, pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of betty, not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her. aaron eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of betty's no-good husband and he is almost unrecognisable. the other revelation here is kinnear, whose portrayal of the soap's star is not too overcooked. there's a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich'e as thickly as possible, and kinnear resists, instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance, despite simply being a soap star.<br /><br />the soap opera is realised so well, it could almost exist. labute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too. if the soap opera had been too satirical, a large part of the film would not have worked. to do a "days of our lives" spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie. the dedication to detail pays off, as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into betty's reality more and more, while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre. the scenes on the set feel real, as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured, you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right.<br /><br />the neat resolution of the final act, while being a tad predictable, is wholly satisfying overall. it's a shame that after labute directed this wonderful film, the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man, a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him. unfortunately, one cannot absolve him of all responsibility.<br /><br />if you haven't seen nurse betty, it's something to discover. if you have, it's worth a re-visit. there is a charm to nurse betty that is infectious, even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards. a hidden gem nonetheless.
