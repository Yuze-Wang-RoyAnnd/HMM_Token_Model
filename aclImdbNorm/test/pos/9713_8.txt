this movie blew me away - i have only seen two episodes of the show, never saw the first movie, but went to a pre-screening where johnny knoxville himself introduced the movie, telling us to 'turn off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half.' he was right. as a movie, this would probably rate a 2, given it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness, and very little production value. however, that isn't the point. everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through - not only were some of the stunts creative (see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to look at it)), but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise. these guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews (and probably can't even be published here), involving lots of things below the belt. however, almost 3/4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (even if morally condemnable, but remember knoxville's statement), and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch. only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on tv, so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into - some stuff is disgusting, but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all. as a person who thought jackass the tv show was an over-hyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain, the amount of fun i had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in. it's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the borat movie comes out. with this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - i guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch. so enjoy, and don't worry: you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home.
