i can not say this movie was a hilarious, but i must have had a grin on my face the entire time. i like this darker kind of comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a duffel bag" or "coldblooded"<br /><br />the way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. to me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience. the way terry looks at us is hilarious, you can almost pretend you're his accomplice.
