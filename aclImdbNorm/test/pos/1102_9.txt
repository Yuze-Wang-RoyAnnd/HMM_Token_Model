i saw this film via one of the actors' agents, and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth. australia in terms of the overall *tone,* which is rightly dark and moody.<br /><br />i thought the little boy in the film was excellent. mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case. he was really very good. in terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo, well, i just think this film is plain 'weird.' it's a real weirdo film, with weirdo locations, storyline, weird stuff going on the whole time. but 'good' weird as opposed to 'bad'.<br /><br />its hard to think of other movies like it, but its not at all like cars ate paris, maybe more like a repulsion, but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the 60's. its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it.<br /><br />jingo, my question is also about the title. why modern love?? anyone? also, jingo, what did you mean by "god forsaken" when you were talking about australia, hmmm? just curious
