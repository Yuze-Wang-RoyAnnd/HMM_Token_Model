having been interested in akhenaton for many years i was surprised to learn about this film via e-bay and bought a copy on dvd for 99p. i enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character sinuhe makes it more of a "family saga" rather than an action film. the costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). the back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. my main interest was in the character of akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. in this film he was portrayed as being "jesus" like in his refusal to go to war with the hittites even through they were invading egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power. initially one makes a connection between sinuhe, who was cast adrift in the river nile in a reed basket, and the old testament moses. but this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a moses like character carries akhenaton's monotheistic religion out to the wider world, if such a film will ever be politically possible to make. it is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between sinuhe and merit, the character played by jean simmons is hard to accept. and that sinuhe, an educated physician, would be so smitten by nefer the babylonian "femme fatal" to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and tomb is not really believable, neither that his parents would even have a tomb. in real life nefer (nefertitti) was the wife of akhenaton. and although horemheb did become pharaoh it was after a few others including tutankhamen , who was the son of akhenaton.<br /><br />but of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. maybe following "the de vinci code" book and film this film be re-made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism! i wait in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject.
