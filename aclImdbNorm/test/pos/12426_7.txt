adam (eric jungmann) and obnoxious best friend harley (justin urich) are driving cross country to a wedding. along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker sarah (aimee brooks). then, for no reason, a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the road...and maybe kill them. who is doing this and why?<br /><br />pretty good horror film. its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action. it's also a horror comedy. most of the humor is infantile and really gross but actually somewhat funny. also this movie really piles on the gore at times--but that's a good thing! the acting is ok--jungmann overplays his nerd role a bit much; urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed best friend--but pulls it off; brooks is good too in a limited role.<br /><br />but i could see the "twist" ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end (especially the rescue). still, this is a gory, sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie. i give it a 7.
