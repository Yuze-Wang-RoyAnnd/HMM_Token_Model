personally, i don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. <br /><br />the movie starts with elizabeth lane (barbara stanwyck). "liz" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'martha stewart' of connecticut. of course, she's lying. this becomes a problem when her publisher, mr yardley, asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas. in addition, mr yardley, who's going to be alone for christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the christmas party. from there, things just go crazy.<br /><br />since the movie is set on a new england farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling. plus, the characters are hilarious. mr. yardley is always shouting orders, and liz's friend felix is always yelling 'catastroph!' when things go wrong. finally, the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts "what a christmas!" <br /><br />in short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.
