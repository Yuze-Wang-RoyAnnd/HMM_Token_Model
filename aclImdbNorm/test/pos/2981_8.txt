my girlfriend and i saw this movie when it was originally released. the controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. we were close to the same age as paul and michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. we were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. this movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have. i still remember sitting in the movie theater with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic (albiet syrupy) final scenes.
