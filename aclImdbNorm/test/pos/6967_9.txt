ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel. the ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies, but there still cool. there are some nice flash backs, from ghoulies the first movie. jonathan is back once again in this one. he wasn't in parts 2 or 3 though. the movie is low budget at times, but fun to watch. you've got tony cox as the dark ghoulie and arturo gil as the light ghoulie. the ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys, instead of evil like in the first three movies. both ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. then you've got the very hot alexandra! it's a great dark comedy and funny! any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching ghoulies 4. the dvd is finally coming out this july 2007! hopefully one day ghoulies iii will be on dvd in the usa. i'd really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too. i doubt it will happen though. it's 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet. if there ever is a sequel i hope jim wynorski will make it.<br /><br />i give ghoulies iv a 9/10
