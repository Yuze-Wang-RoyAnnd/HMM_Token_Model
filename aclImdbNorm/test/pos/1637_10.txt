this definitely the most tension filled x-files episode of the first season. this episode is what i think of when i hear "x-files". the plot is simple but exiting. our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an alskan outpost in which it's research team appears to have killed each other. it turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice, had infected the research team. the parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity. soon none can tell who they can trust, or who's infected or not.<br /><br />this episode was a direct tribute to john carpenters great horror film "the thing". the thing is set in antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which it's occupant have been killed or killed themselves. an alien that had been buried in the ice for a 10000 years had been thawed out. it has the abilities to imitate any life form. therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foes.<br /><br />believe me the thing is one of the most exiting, and tension filled horror movies you'll ever see. if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it. or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see ice.<br /><br />ice is the best direct tribute/homage to john carpenter's the thing i have ever seen, and it lives up to it's inspiration as one of the best x-files episodes. i give it a 10/10.
