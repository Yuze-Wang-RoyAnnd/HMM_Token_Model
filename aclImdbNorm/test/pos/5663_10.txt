i think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of full-scale review to giorgino, merely because it's one of those viewer-dependent, complex, poetical and philosophical movies that are brain-wearing if, while watching them, you're trying to enjoy their shell and get to their core simultaneously, yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art (which, i hope, i am). the first thing: it's a certain masterpiece, even of that kind of art which remains through a long long time; the second: it's one of those rare "dark" movies in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depressing, like the art of pieter brueghel or caspar david friedrich. as to the core of the movie, someone called it kafkian, though i don't agree with that because actually it's far beyond kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like edgar poe's parables: dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls. actually, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative), giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul. those who have such souls are usually branded as crazy by our society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue all the others lost when become "grown": the virtue of god's love. indeed, giorgino is a very christian movie, "be like children" (mt 18:3) is it's real hidden tag-line, though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the christian philosophy for, dare to suppose, true god is beyond any human moral. yet i think that boutonnat is too harsh portraying "grown" people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls, but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so. while watching giorgino don't try to look for some hidden symbols (though there are some), better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior, and do learn from them. also i cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography, especially through rational use of color filters, incredibly apposite editing, wonderful acting of all the cast and, of course, due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the brueghel's "hunters in the snow". also, interestingly enough, the scene with death in the form of an old woman with sunken black-ringed eyes riding a cart, instantly reminded me of pesta (plague) from the series of drawings by the norwegian painter theodor kittelsen, depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley. is it a coincidence?
