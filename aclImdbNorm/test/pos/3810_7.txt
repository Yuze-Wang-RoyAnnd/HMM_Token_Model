don't even try to figure out the logic of this story. but do ride along with 10-year-old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed. more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion! nothing makes sense, yet it's impossible to stop watching motorama! now, where can i find that 'r'????
