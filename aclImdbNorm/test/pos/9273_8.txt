a refreshing interview with the legendary italian cinematographer-producer-director who passed away in 1999 with close to 200 features to his credit as director. a large portion is spent on d'amato's softcore sex films including his notorious emanuelle entries with laura gemser. they also briefly cover his porn career, which kept him afloat during his last decade or so. more interesting to me is the section focusing on his horror and action efforts. d'amato has plenty of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget film-making including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones amid the fake ones while shooting in a 2,000-year-old catacomb. other interviewees include george eastman and al cliver. i would have liked a bit more conversation about his stateside filmirage productions (not a single question about troll 2; granted it wasn't the cult film then it was now).
