the idea is not original... if you have seen such kind of story before, you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes... the script, the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious... if you haven't seen such story before, it is definitely a good experience, you will enjoy the twist at the end...don't forget to watch it again after you know the "truth", you will even more enjoy the plots... even though i have a right guess at the very beginning, i still couldn't help stick on my seat till the end...<br /><br />conclusion: a must see!! this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan...forget hollywood!<br /><br />don't miss it!!
