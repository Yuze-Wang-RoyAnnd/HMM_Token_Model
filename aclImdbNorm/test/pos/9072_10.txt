the bevy of box office big league stars is phenomenal in this movie!! william baldwin, kiefer sutherland, kevin bacon and julia roberts!! this movie was made in one of my favorite years too, 1990!! i am a chicagoan, and the setting in chicago was very identifiable and artistically expedited as well!!i liked this movie, and the agitation which motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful element to the plot which was utterly sensational!!<br /><br />"flatliners" centers around a group of disgruntled pre-med students who want to be flat lined as a way of attaining some sort of societal vindication!! when life does not make sense, it would appear very illogical to get curious about apocalyptic nightmares!! at the same time, once their desultory curiosity has gotten the better of them, there is no turning back!! the king of the hill, (so to speak) is the one who vehemently shouts: i will do two minutes!! who else is going to do that!! anyone want to try for two and a half!! ultimately, all of these newly arrived and very unwelcome recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in these re pro-bate's lives!! the consummation to their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360 degree perspective on the issues they were agonizing over!! whatever purpose all of this reckless and academic chicanery serves, it is definitely an original approach for asserting your personality!! i liked this movie, 1990 was a good year for me too, things seemed to fall into place that year!! when i saw this movie some night in november during the year 1990, i was very glad that i did!!
