to the eight people who found the previous fierce people comments by "psycolicious me" and "topdany" "helpful," as well as to any future site visitors who see them before their authors delete them: these negative critique's are not only shorter than the site guidelines mandate, but they are entirely bogus, nonfactual, incorrect, and misinformative. for instance, blythe's dad is in a coma, not dead--maya and finn even visit him in the hospital. furthermore, it was estate deer poacher dwayne--not blythe--who knocked up jilly the maid, etc., etc. so if you have add which makes you incapable of focusing on the simplest details, please keep your condition to yourself by not pretending to be siskel or ebert. otherwise, include a disclaimer with your comments!
