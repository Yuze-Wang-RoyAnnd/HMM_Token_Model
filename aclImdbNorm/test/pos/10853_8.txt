tipping the velvet (2002) (tv) was directed by geoffrey sax for bbc television. the basic plot is a coming-of-age story for the protagonist, nan astley, played well by rachael stirling. as a teenager, nan works in her family-run oyster house. everyone expects her to stay at home, then marry an appropriate husband, and settle down to family life. nan expects this too.<br /><br />everything changes when nan meets kitty butler (keeley hawes) a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothes and captures the hearts of her audience. the audience includes nan, who is sexually attracted to kitty in a way in which she's not attracted to her boyfriend. <br /><br />the remainder of the film follows nan to london and through her ups (sort of) and her downs (horrible) as a lesbian and sometimes male impersonator. <br /><br />as is typical for the bbc, every role, no matter how small, is performed by an excellent actor. the bbc has a depth and breadth of performing artists that is truly marvelous. none of the supporting actors stands out in my mind--they were uniformly good. both stirling and hawes are wonderful, and their acting carries the film along.<br /><br />it's always sad to be reminded of how difficult life can be for someone who doesn't fit society's mold for what is normal. i know it isn't easy for lesbians even in the u.s., even today. imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in victorian england. we've come a long way, but we still have a long way to travel.
