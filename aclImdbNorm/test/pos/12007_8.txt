fun movie! the script is awful but the quality of actors saves the day. john hurt is perfect, as is jane alexander. beau bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. the story is the true star. based on a true story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping east germany sucks you in and holds you. joyous ending provides enough elation to compensate for script. don't expect academy award quality but it's a great ride for the whole family.
