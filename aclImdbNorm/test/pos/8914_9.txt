and a hard spot somewhere else. i haven't seen this movie since i was quite young, maybe 12 or 13, who knows. but what i do know is this is the movie that taught me how to masturbate. i kid you not. i have no idea if it is any good by any real standards of today, but for me, back then, it was everything.<br /><br />the only reason i feel comfortable writing this is because i'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it. i mean, really, who is going to look up this movie these days?<br /><br />i just discovered that i have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length i most take up in a review. i had no idea there was such a minimum length, but there i go, like a student trying to fill up a page in a journal, my ten lines. thank you very much.
