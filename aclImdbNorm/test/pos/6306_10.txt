i've seen this film so many times, it's that good. maybe because i can relate to tittas way of life is the reason why. not everyone would find it to their taste. also, my italien is improving after each viewing. am i a sad case? thankyou mr sorrentino. i look forward to your next film. although i did not see the film at a cinema, i have the dvd and would encourage anyone to buy it. the special feature extras alone is worth the price. the amount of time a director spends on the making of a film is very seldom appreciated, the extras on the dvd gives an excellent insight to the making of a film. as for the story of the film, i'm bias.i happen to rave about it to all my friends, but as i said before, i relate very much to the main character who is a loner in a situation not of his own choosing. the mafia in sicily use titta to launder their money in a swiss bank. he owes them for costing them millions of dollars years ago in stock market deal that went wrong.love kills.
