hello all you lovely dirty dancing fans!!!! i came across this message board when i was bored one day and think it's cool. i absolutely love dd! i first saw it at my friends house when i was 13 (now i'm 17) and got hooked!! i saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after, i bought the dvd for myself. at this stage, i have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever anyone asks me about it. ''i carried a watermelon?!'' it's gotten so bad that i bought the soundtrack and recorded micky and sylvia's song, and now it's the ringtone on my phone!! most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but i don't care what they think of it, i know it's brill! i was reading the comments earlier and i have a few questions for you lot - 1. why are you asking trivial questions like what ages lisa and baby are? i don't think it matters that much. they are teenagers in the 60's, isn't that enough? 2. where did ye get this special edition that you're all talking about? it sounds very interesting... please reply to this. i'd like to see other fans opinions... cheers! charliesangel415 xxx
