when i saw gone with the wind i thought that there could not be better actors than vivian leigh and clark gable to play scarlett and rhett but then i saw the movie scarlet. i fell in love for this dramatic story. i love timothy dalton as rhett butler, he's fantastic. this is a movie i could watch a thousand times and it still wouldn't bore me.
