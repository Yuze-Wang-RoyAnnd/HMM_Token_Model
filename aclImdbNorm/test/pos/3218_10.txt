this is definitely an excellent show. i don't have cable, so i started renting them, because my friend recommended it. i thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. but it was not. it is surprisingly deep. it is also very witty. it moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. it is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. it is about rory and lorelai's relationship. instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship-- about a mother and daughter. the characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job. it is definitely the best tv show i have very come across.
