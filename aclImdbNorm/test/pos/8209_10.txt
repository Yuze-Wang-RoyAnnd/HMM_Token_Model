i loved this movie!<br /><br />movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political, and other problems that affect the majority. this movie served that purpose.<br /><br />i identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened. at the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public, yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions. and, i know what it is like when people do to you what they did to angela bennett, because they have done it to me.<br /><br />i greatly enjoyed sandra bullock's portrayal of angela bennett/ruth marx. she portrays a pretty, intelligent, and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds, fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those whom she loves. losing her self-concept and succumbing to that age-old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality.<br /><br />the climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem.
