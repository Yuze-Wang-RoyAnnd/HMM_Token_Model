for anyone who has trouble with naughty, mad or troublesome kids this is an essential programme to watch. it is just the best behaviour documentary programme, not just for tips but for the transformations. the quite attractive jo frost is supernanny, with fifteen years of nannying experience she now has a programme where she shows a family where the kids are misbehaving very, very badly. frost is the nanny who does not let the kids win. every episode they have young kids who are mad and very, very naughty, e.g. throwing things, constantly swearing, hitting relatives and parents and many other horrible experiences. but every episode by the end of the show the kids are transformed by the parents (with the help of frost) from little monsters to lovable children. it is just wonderful when the transformations are successful, jo frost is an excellent supernanny. it was nominated the national television award for most popular factual programme (twice). it was number 15 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004. very good!
