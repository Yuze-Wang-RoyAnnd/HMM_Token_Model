even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to dvd was a blessing for all time. north and south truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. i can still remember the first time i caught a glimpse of this series on tv when i was about 8 years old. i though wow this looks exciting. to bad i never had the chance to see book one and two on tv in the netherlands. when book three was broad-casted as a late evening series in the netherlands in the summer of 2004 i just knew i had to see the other two series. to most people book three was a big disappointment as far as i know. well since i have seen book one on dvd, i must say that until now it is the best of the entire 3 books. to all youngsters who just watch the fancy movies like the patriot "oh america for freedom" there is a more realistic view to see for them here.....
