as a movie, the italian job is ok at best; good (not great) acting,<br /><br />nice visuals and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enough<br /><br />to walk out on. but as a car commercial for the new breed of mini<br /><br />coopers, this film is spectacular!<br /><br />*spoilers*<br /><br />ok, it's a typical heist film with the odd twist (the underwater safe- cracking was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was fairly solid<br /><br />(with the exception of a putrid wahlberg), but when it all came<br /><br />down to it, the real "stars" of this picture were the three mini<br /><br />coopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping,<br /><br />bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory. the audience i was<br /><br />sitting amongst actually "ooed" and "aahed" when theron's little<br /><br />red number first hit the screen (strangely enough, neither she nor<br /><br />wahlberg garnered the same reaction).<br /><br />the film starts out promising. mos def, seth green, donald<br /><br />sutherland, edward norton and jason statham all begin as an<br /><br />interesting and humourous band of characters, with the only real<br /><br />uninspired performance being that of the usually good mark<br /><br />wahlberg. why he claims this is his best film i can't imagine; his<br /><br />character is completely one-note, and he plays him so blandly it<br /><br />was as if mr. rogers came back from the dead and was inhabiting<br /><br />his body. charlize is fine as sutherland's daughter, though<br /><br />nothing magical. seth green's character is perfect and the<br /><br />running napster jokes (including a cameo by napster founder,<br /><br />shawn fanning) are hilarious; he and some of mos def's early<br /><br />lines add some much needed sparks of humour. unfortunately,<br /><br />edward norton and donald sutherland don't get near enough<br /><br />screen time.<br /><br />you can see most of the plot coming from a mile away, and the<br /><br />dialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways, but i doubt the<br /><br />filmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here, so taken as a<br /><br />typical action/suspense flick it comes out alright. worth seeing on<br /><br />cheap night i'd recommend.<br /><br />7/10. not worth it's weight in gold, but makes for nice fillings.
