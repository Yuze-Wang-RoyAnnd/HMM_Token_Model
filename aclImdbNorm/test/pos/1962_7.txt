less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. but, where they hadn't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with larry clark's movies 'kids' and 'bully.' <br /><br />societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (daniel roebuck) boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town. keanu reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch, the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience, anyway, while the others either don't do anything about the girl's death or want to help their friend hide the body. <br /><br />i don't know who is more sick in this film--crispin glover--who becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state. dennis hopper, an on-edge drug dealer (who clings to a female blowup doll) that befriends the teens (as a dealer, of course) and suddenly becomes involved in the events. or, josh miller, who plays reeve's little brother, tim. he appears to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until his emotional breakdown at the end. it is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare, obviously. and certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many great performances all around (even reeves proved some acting capability).<br /><br />help yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard.
