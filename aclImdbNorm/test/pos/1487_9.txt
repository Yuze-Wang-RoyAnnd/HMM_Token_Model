this tv series is about a foolish and unconventional english gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.<br /><br />i remember watching mr bean with my family back in 1990, when i was still a child. my family laughed so hard at every episode, and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later. the memorable scenes which are still in my head include mr bean attempting to get out of his car park, shooting out the lights, counting sheep, and him in the swimming pool. we bought all the mr bean videos on vhs, no mater how expensive they were. it was worth it because we watched them over and over again! it is so rare to see a very funny tv series that is suitable for all ages.
