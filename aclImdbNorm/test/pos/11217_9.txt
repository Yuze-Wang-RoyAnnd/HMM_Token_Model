the second "mr. eko" episode has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first ("the 23rd psalm"), but in just about every other department it is one of the best episodes of season 2, advancing the series' mythology/background as well as the characters. a new dharma initiative station - the pearl - is discovered by locke and eko, and the orientation film that they find and watch inside completes locke's transformation from a believer ("orientation" - after the end of the film: "we're gonna have to watch this again") to a doubter ("s.o.s" - "did you push that button, henry? i need to know") to a non-believer ("?" - after the end of the film: "do you want to watch this again? - "no, i've seen enough"). terry o'quinn's performance is powerful as usual ("every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button"). meanwhile, eko takes his place as the man who becomes sure that he was brought on the island as part of his true destiny, which is to continue pushing the button. other high points of "?" are a startling, unique dream sequence where person a has the dream as being person b (this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of lost could use much more of), and the haunting scene of libby's last word before her death, and the way jack and hurley cannot possibly know its true meaning. ***1/2 out of 4.
