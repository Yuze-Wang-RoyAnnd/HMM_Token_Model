i finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around -- first, the good old scummy, sleazy embassy vhs print called screamers, and then a new fully restored italian dvd by everyone's new favorite media company, no shame of italy.<br /><br />the american adverts about "men turned inside out" is as everyone says, totally misleading, and indicative of a roger cormanized take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy-adventure thriller for grown ups. the complete italian version is a somewhat sprawling, well designed and deliberately paced take on "island of dr. moreau", and there's nothing wrong with that. it's a sumptuous, handsome euro horror outing with a brain, good plotting, character development, location shooting, period costuming and sets, etc.<br /><br />but i must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed puffer still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid, sleazy and unkempt roger corman version, which has some nice over the top gore, a flashy but preposterous opening segment, and then the bulk of martino's original film, albeit somewhat abridged to make room for roger's idea of entertainment. the pacing was somewhat quicker, the shock sequences closer together, and you see just as much of ms. bach's fantastic form as you do in the extended italian version.<br /><br />i still don't have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though: there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of. a local voodoo subplot didn't help much, and it's funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist ... perhaps a few more viewings are in order. i will say this: fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these pal imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video -- the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff. nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the screamers print, but it's still interesting stuff, and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter, roger corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him, and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be.<br /><br />7/10
