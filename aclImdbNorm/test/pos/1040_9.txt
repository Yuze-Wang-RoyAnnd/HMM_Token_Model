has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? i can see that a lot of people have inquired but i can't tell if any of them have been successful. it's hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today, especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country. how can this be true and what can we do to change it? as an aside i agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site. this is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today. lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway. now we want to share it with our children ... but we can't? if that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information?
