i first saw this film as a teenager (i'm now in my 40's), and have long considered it to be my favorite movie. the story is enormously moving, without being sentimental. the acting, especially by march and loy, is dead-on. and the fact that dana andrews is too old for his role doesn't take away from the believability of his romance with theresa wright (whom i believe is the only major character in the film still living). this could have turned out to be another post-war melodrama, but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen.
