`rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. the film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. the story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band judas priest. if you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. however, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of jennifer aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. i could not say the same about the rock star himself; mark wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. i did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes. it reminded me of my teenage years where everything `smelled like teen spirit'. i guess the film is worth a viewing, but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some `girls, girls, girls.' *** average
