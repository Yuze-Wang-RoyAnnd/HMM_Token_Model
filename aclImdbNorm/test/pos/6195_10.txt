imagine "24" completely uncensored, given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill/prevent and you have an idea of how good this tv series is. people in the us have known for a long time that showtime is the new hbo, they are making far better cutting edge, powerful shows and this is no exception. the show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted, taking in important facets such as faith, religion, funding, means and needs. to the uninitiated, there is much to be learnt about the muslim faith here. unlike on mainstream shows like "24" where the terrorists are merely nutcases who the good guys shoot, their purpose and reasonings here are fully examined. what gives the show more credence is the latest technology the cell/fbi uses and the authentic shots in europe, the us and the middle east, no expense is spared to tell the story accurately the cast are relatively unknowns but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautly-written script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns. this show has not got the credit it deserves and ironically is a bit of a sleeper hit itself, must see for anyone at all interested in this genre
