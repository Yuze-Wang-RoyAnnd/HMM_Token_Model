in the changing world of cg and what-not of cartoon animations etc. etc., faeries was a warm welcome at least by me. i think it's important to show these sort of films once in a while, to preserve them and help remind us of where the originality and fun of cartoons actually came from. people were talking about how it is boring because of the graphics and stuff but hey! think about the films that will be considered boring if every film looked like the new state of the art ones everybody and their mother is making these days. call me old-fashioned but i liked it. it's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings and all it really needs from its audience is their imagination.
