talkshow with spike feresten is one of those shows that will definitely polarize audiences. either you like it or you don't. personally, i find most of the bits hilarious, but it does have some "huh?" moments. <br /><br />staples like "idiot paparazzi" are always good for a laugh, but my all-time favorite bit has to be the one-off "hollywood douchebag". "comedy for stoners" is the only regular bit that generally leaves me confused (which is part of the point!) spike and his team of writers manage to churn out loads of fresh comedy time after time so the show never feels stale. feresten's brand of humor may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying.<br /><br />the masses have spoken! we like this show and want more. please note i am not a friend of or affiliated in any way with spike feresten, "talkshow with spike feresten" staff, or fox network and affiliates. it's just plain funny!
