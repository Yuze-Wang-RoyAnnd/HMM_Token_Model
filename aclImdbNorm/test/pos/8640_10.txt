david lynch's ninth full length feature film, mulholland drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy. if anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes to the often bitter truth. every frame of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together. it is a movie that does not compromise, nor does it fail to fully handle the challenging form and camera language, as might have been the case earlier with lost highway.<br /><br />although one clearly recognizes classic lynchian motifs and devices, the movie remains highly original, even in the light of it being a lynch movie. lost highway marked a new way of telling a story; bred an unconventional mean of setting emotions on to the screen. with mulholland drive, lynch not only managed to control this technique, but takes it to new levels in making it much more complex and multi dimensional. in doing this, he creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind. in a press conference on the cannes film festival 2001, david lynch said that striving for perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. talking about synergies like this becomes highly relevant to mulholland dr. where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; dreamscapes and parallels intertwine to create the story. in some art, the beauty of it lies in its simpleness. this is not the case with mulholland drive, and has never been with lynch. it is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world.<br /><br />it never gets forced like, in my opinion, for example memento does, using an original way of communicating with the viewers. further comparing mulholland drive to other movies, i think it proves david lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film making in a way that no one has ever done. compared to for example alejandro jodorowsky or contemporary matthew barney, i do believe that lynch more clearly manages not letting the artist dominate the film maker or, more likely, david lynch better understands and executes film making as an art form.<br /><br />understanding the plot is no small feat, but lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life. the lynchian cinema is often, and most definitely in mulholland drive, a surge of human emotions. working with emotions is a delicate craft that demands understanding and depth. as lynch puts it: "a little bit too much, and the emotion goes away. a little bit too little, and it doesn't happen." in mulholland drive, david lynch has no problem making this balance. lynch's portraits span all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. watching mulholland drive is a journey through the subconscious. it is a truthful and naked movie with indisputable artistic value. that is why i love mulholland drive and what's taken it to the pinnacle of cinema history. the ultimate movie.
