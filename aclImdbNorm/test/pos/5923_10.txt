a great movie about triumph over all the nay-sayers who try to kill your spirit, achieving the impossible. i won't go on about it, other than to say that i liked to reflect on the this film when i'm facing something particularly daunting, and realize that if lindberg could do what he did, i can certainly face the task before me. definitely a "feel good" movie.<br /><br />see it. you won't be disappointed.
