this is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around. the production values are in a class of their own. the characters are rounded and interesting. this is entertainment at its best. some of the aliens are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying humour which makes it unmissable. i hope that this series goes on for many years and will have many spin-offs. science fiction has had its bad press, some justified, but this is truly a flagship science fiction series and i thank henson for it. top marks.
