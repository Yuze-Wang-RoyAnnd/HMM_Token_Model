i saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! it is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! i was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. it's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. i really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a saturday night rental. with your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :d it's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings. not to mention, beautiful landscape shots and fantastic acting. see it, i'm sure you'll love it as much as i did!
