grand champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. andrew morton at the fort worth star telegram said it best "if walt disney had hailed from texas, he would have made grand champion" <br /><br />the movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul. the kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. i bet bruce willis and julia roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see:) (g rated) <br /><br />this is a masterfully crafted "simple" little film made in texas by texas barry tubb. take your kids, take your kids friends, take grandma too....they will all enjoy it and you will too.
