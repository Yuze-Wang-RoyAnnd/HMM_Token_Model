one would think that a film based on the life of the japanese author yukio mishima would be a daunting if not impossible task. however paul schrader has indeed made a film "about" mishima that is both superb & complex. while it is not a literal biography, schrader & his co-screenwriter leonard scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents from his life, including his sucide and crafted what can best be described as incidental tableaus that are visually sparse and stunning. mishima's homosexuality is almost not there, due to legal threats from his widow, but in spite of this, the film is still terrific, and one of the best films i saw in 1985. i should also mention the important contribution of philip glass who did the score, which adds an additional texture to the film, and is superior to the one he did for scorsese's kundun. also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar. hopefully this film will soon be available on dvd.
