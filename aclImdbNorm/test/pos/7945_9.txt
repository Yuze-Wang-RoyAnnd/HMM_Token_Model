i saw this film back in the early 70's and i was mesmerised by judy geeson. for me it captured the clandestine nature of rod steigers irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker, played by geeson.<br /><br />you couldn't help feel a little sorry for the wife, played brilliantly by claire bloom. i was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on dvd.<br /><br />i defy anyone who saw the film, and it's strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three main character performances, and i would have loved to have seen it again, if nothing else for a purely nostalgic reason.<br /><br />going back in time, some 35 years.<br /><br />a real classic.
