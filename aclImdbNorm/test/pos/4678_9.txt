i wonder how many mini cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie? it couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car, which is featured in this film, along with an attractive cast.<br /><br />this is a very, very entertaining heist-and-chase film. it features a "cool" cast with mark wahlberg, charlize theron, edward norton, seth green and jason statham.<br /><br />the best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in venice, italy. the film doesn't overdo the violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. the cat-and-mouse game between norton and theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch.<br /><br />once again, however, we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as "the good guys." how many times has this happened since the days of "butch cassidy and the sundance kid" in the 1960s? it's twisted hollywood, for you. in here, one of the criminals (norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (donald sutherland) of the gang, so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain. also theron's character is in the typically overblown-feminist mode of hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) better than a man. a third minor irritation is seth green's smug, smart-ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool. <br /><br />despite these hindrances, it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex....and, yes, those little cars are cool. everyone i've talked to who has seen this film, enjoyed it.
