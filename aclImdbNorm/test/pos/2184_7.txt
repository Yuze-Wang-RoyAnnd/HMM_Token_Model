this telecast of the classic musical "sweeney todd" does not do the production justice, but is still quite enthralling.<br /><br />firstly, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the wheeling multi-set to the startling trapdoor. then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.<br /><br />the main failing here is in the performances people give. oh, they're believable, all right-- but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast-paced as, say, "kiss me." in fact, the actress playing johanna is not only off-tempo to a dismal degree, but also slightly off-key. and angela lansbury's slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit irritating. one more thing, too-- what, exactly, is so bad about judge turpin's performance of "johanna" that it is banned from the american theatre, but not the cannibal anthem "a little priest"?<br /><br />otherwise, this is an excellent production. it's a thrill to watch people do what they love-- and i'm not even peripherally talking about "meat pies with a twist".
