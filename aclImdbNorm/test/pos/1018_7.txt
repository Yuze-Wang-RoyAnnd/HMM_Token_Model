"are you in the house alone?" belongs to the pre-cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows. it is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. kathleen beller plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters. everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but beller is really scared. tony bill and blythe danner play beller's parents, ellen travolta (john's sister) is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid. it's a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. beller is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters. blythe danner, who i usually don't like, gives a truly moving performance. nice little film.
