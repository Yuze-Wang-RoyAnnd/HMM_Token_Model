if you're even mildly interested in the war between the states, this film is worth watching. it is great historical story telling. no flashing sabres, no cavalry charges, no carnage -- just the story of a sorry group of union soldiers stumbling into the farm of a confederate woman and her son and taking as much as their captain's conscience allows. this quantity moves up and down as events unfold affecting his sense of humanity in conflict with his sense of duty to his men and his cause. ultimately, he reaches a compromise that any of us would be hard put to top. <br /><br />i appreciate the historical treatment of the war in kentucky, a slave state that tried to stay neutral but eventually opted to remain in the union under mysterious political circumstances involving the detention of certain legislators. roughly half the soldiers from kentucky fought for each side, but there's never been much treatment of what it was like to have lived there through those times. this film makes a great contribution simply in the "look and feel" of the time and place.
