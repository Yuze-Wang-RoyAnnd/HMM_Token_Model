for estoninans finland sometimes seems like a land of dreams. a land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. find love, start a new life etc. but... aku louhimies has made this brilliant piece which shows that everything is not so good in finland as well. that finland can be just as paha maa (the bad land) than any other country. it shows that people there can be just as miserable in their lives than we in everywhere else. that sometimes there's nothing good. this movie nicely shows why finland is one of the top suicidal countries. it's not easy to live in north. cold climate changes us. i've become more and more attracted to finnish movies and this one is very good. the acting is great as well. jasper p"a"akk"onnen has become one of the top finnish stars. beware of the sex scene (if you have little children) and a little depression that might come afterwards the movie! 8/10
