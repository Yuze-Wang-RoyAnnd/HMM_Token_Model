definitely not only for urban legend aficionados, campfire tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories. it is also a film that exceeded the (low) expectations i had. a horror film i had never heard or read about, a straight-to-video release (granted, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise, but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing), a cast of mostly unknowns... well, i'll leave the math to you.<br /><br />the film proves to be an entertaining, suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience. the four stories are well-paced and satisfying. the only one i felt was a little weaker was "the locket", for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters' actions; however, i still loved the tale, its atmosphere and ending. my favorite one was the third story, "people can lick too" - the suspense in it is not only palpable, but also educational.<br /><br />i found campfire tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance, and then goes on recommending it to everyone.<br /><br />7/10
