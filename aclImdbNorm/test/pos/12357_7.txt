i thought it would be more fantastic a tale. but the subject is rather down to earth compared to the story about the death carriage i was expecting. in fact there is much more of a social drama. as usual in the "european authors' movies".<br /><br />actors are interesting, not overacting as in the average silent movie. images are not so good as to be stuck in your mind as in bergman's smultronst"allet.<br /><br />this is true the comparison between the two movies is the main point here. smultronst"allet begins with a vision of a death carriage wherein sj"ostr"om's character can see his own body. there are clocks without hands. he is compelled to look back on what he has done wrong. there is a vision of his happy family in the country. in k"orkarlen sj"ostr"om's wife doesn't cheat on him before his eyes but she wants to flee with the little children because it would never get any better with him. eventually, edit's confession is some kind of a live judgement.<br /><br />well i would just add that sj"ostr"om destroying the door with an axe because his wife locked it and plans to go away with the children reminded me of the shining. which was much more of a fantasy tale with death hanging around.
