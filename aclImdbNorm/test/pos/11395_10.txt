i rented boogie nights last week and i could tell you, when i watched the film i had a blast. if you think that when you watch the film you will get sicked by the porn. i mean yes, if your not a porn person who can't bother being by it, than this isn't the film to see. but the thing is, the whole film isn't really about porn. well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through. the actors played there roles perfect, especially mark wahlberg, john c. reilly, and william h. macy. the sex scenes, of course are terrific but mainly focus on the character's hype in porn films until there struggles. excellent film, one of the best! <br /><br />hedeen's outlook: 10/10 **** a+
