another brilliant portrayal by kiefer sutherland who plays mickey hayden, a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims. i absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm, and i wasn't disappointed with "eye of the killer" (aka after alice). i only wish the movie had been released theatrical first.
