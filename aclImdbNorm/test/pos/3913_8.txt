i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car "to get stripped" deserves whatever happens to them.<br /><br />the guy, wade who "went to a barbershop and asked for the he-man haircut" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. that's a little too high-maintenance for me. <br /><br />also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks "like elton john only gayer," but that whole plot goes nowhere! <br /><br />blake was hot,i could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend, who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig (no chihuahaua in her handbag,though but that would have been really precious). i don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways. nick the car thief is the sexiest! one of the best parts is where a football lands by him, and instead of throwing it back, he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football. see, that's just the kind of guy he is. he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife-beater. her bra straps are showing for, like 1/2 the movie!<br /><br />mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this.
