william faulkner was one of the american writers to win the nobel prize in literature. faulkner mostly wrote about life in the south particularly during the depression years. many of his stories have been adapted to screen. short stories like two soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in december 1941 after the attack on pearl harbor. the older brother, pete greer, goes to memphis, tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. his younger brother doesn't take his departure well. he manages to get a bus ticket to memphis without any money to find his brother. he surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he wants to enlist also at 10 years old. ron perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy. this short film won an oscar for best short-live action film which is well-deserved. if it was longer, it could compete with the longer films. everything else like costumes, art direction, and recreating the era of america in 1941 is perfect. the film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most americans were surviving the great depression. the actors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances. if hollywood would make more quality films, i would probably go to the cinema more. if broadway had more quality shows, i would go to the theater more.
