square really landed this one. they didn't try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on final fantasy 7 fans. and boy, are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie! the story might not be all that interesting or credible but it ties in neatly with the story of the game and has several honest-to-god funny moments!! a total surprise there and a welcome one too<br /><br />there are lots of cameos and funny references to the game too. and most important of all: the fighting scenes rock so hard they could cut through diamond! they are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked. i mean, they are some of the best ever created period.<br /><br />see this movie. bye.<br /><br />ps: i know my review sounds like the ravings of a teenage girl. it was, like, totally what i intended.
