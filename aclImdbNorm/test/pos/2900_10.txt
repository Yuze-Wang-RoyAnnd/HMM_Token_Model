i'll bet i watch this film 4 or 5 times a year, and will do so more often, now that the hollyweird moguls have seen fit to put it on dvd, because it's a classic with a capital "c"! this film is timeless! how can people pay $10.00 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of hollyweird with movies like the egyptian; the ten commandments; ben hur; captain newman md on tape; dvd; and cable movie channels; i could go on forever, but this film is so great, and for a relative unknown, edmund purdom carries the movie like atlas carried the world. the story is wonderful, the acting is first-rate, and the graphics at the end are so powerful, you sit in your seat for a few minutes, just trying to let the words sink in! really a knockout of a film. i'd give this one 15 stars if they'd let me! they don't make them like this anymore, but they should!!!!!
