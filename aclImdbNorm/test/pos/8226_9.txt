this film directed by george fitzmaurice, who made so many excellent films, is well up to his excellent standard. it is crisp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable ronald colman in the romantic lead. colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy english peer. he is financially irresponsible (spending, for instance, lb15 of his last lb20 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he names george), but open, wildly generous, contemptuous of lucre, irreverent in the politest possible way, and hopelessly sentimental. he is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. his girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and hence in 1930 a denizen of the demi-monde, played with her typical svelte, narrow-eyed silkiness by the youthful myrna loy. fitzmaurice was not a great user of closeups, and gals of that day had their faces half-hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway, so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. the director seems more interested in the charming colman, anyway. the romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh-faced loretta young, who had not yet become the proto-julie andrews we generally know her as, but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time. it is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the snob-busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by colman. the plot barely matters, as is so often the case with these light and amusing films. this is just such fun.
