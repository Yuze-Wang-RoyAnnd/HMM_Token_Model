this short was the first short released by paramount famous studios and was one of several done by the studio showing popeye engaged directly against the enemy, most often the japanese. while warner brothers, disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, did shorts often depicting germans as foils, the majority of famous studios efforts focused on the japanese. given pearl harbor and popeye's naval ties, this is quite understandable. this is an average short. seein' red, white an' blue and spinach for britain have aged better. but it's still worth watching. recommended.
