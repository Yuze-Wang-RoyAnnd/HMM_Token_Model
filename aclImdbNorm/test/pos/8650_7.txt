the whole movie made me think of the first circle of dante's inferno, where the souls who 'fool' themselves in believing that they are happy go to. they never realize they are actually in an inferno, but nothing is enjoyable, they just move on without any emotion. in that sense dante thought that they the were in the worse part, as they would never actively try to change their situation. nobody can die in that place, but trying to certainly does hurt. i am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely striking.<br /><br />i didn't enjoy the movie when i was watching it, as i was expecting a climax which never came. nevertheless, it made me think afterwards and now i actually think it's a good film - it surely does stick.
