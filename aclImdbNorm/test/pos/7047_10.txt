i first saw this movie in the mid 80's and thought it was a funny movie. as i have gotten older i watch this movie for different reasons. i like to view it when i'm feeling sad/nostalgic for my "lost youth". i was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this film so i can identify with many of the same problems/dilemmas that the campers/cit's in this movie have. i enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip. the film is also full of funny one liners. i highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70's to early 80's.
