my comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his unhappy assessment of the film. i think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. the film was sweet, the acting sufficient, the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week. it wasn't "the hours" (acting), or "the matrix" (special effects), or even "the color purple" (direction). most movies won't be. but it also wasn't the crap fest that "vinny..." would lead you to believe. sorry guy, just my 2 cents.<br /><br />as to the movie itself, it was in the end very gay affirming (+ #1). it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people--you know, just like ours (+ #2)! it opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures (+ #3). and i liked the music (+ #4).
