when the trailer for accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. who could blame them, it looked like fun. but that's exactly the thing. people went into accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. it's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. that being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one. think that, and you will truly enjoy the film (because you'll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) bottom line: watch the movie, and have fun, but don't look for anything groundbreaking.
