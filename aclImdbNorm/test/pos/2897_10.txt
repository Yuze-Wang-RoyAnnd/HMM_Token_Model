this dvd will be treated with indifference by mllions of classic rock music devotees across the world because rush just aren't cool. it is a shame that rush have had to overcome sneering disdain from the majority of north american and british music journalists over their thirty odd year history as this has deprived many people the chance to get into a real band.each of the last four decades are well represented here and what a catalogue of songs it is! we have the seminal "2112", the magical "the trees" and the lyrical "tom sawyer" interspersed with the high-energy, genre-challenging pieces from their latest album "vapor trails." the musicianship is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular and the brazilian fans are just plain crazy (at one point they sing along to an instrumental!)each band member plays at a level that defies belief-real craftsmen performing art.if you doubt this try out the instrumentals "la villa strangiato" or "the rhythm method" for size-and yes the latter is a drum solo (which has to be seen to be believed.)<br /><br />sound and vision production values are very high as befits the rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angled set pieces to boot.<br /><br />this is an astonishing performance and tribute to the canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.
