this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an amazing performance from bruce willis!. all the characters are great, and i thought willis and spencer breslin were just awesome together, plus bruce willis is simply amazing in this!. this is definitely one of bruce's best comedic performances (the waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and i thought it was very well written and made as well, plus the finale is especially cool!. it's good natured and it was cool how you can see russell's (willis) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. i think this should be higher then 6.0 and it's one of the best disney films i have ever seen! plus it has many surprising moments throughout. all the characters are extremely likable, and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well, plus bruce and spencer breslin both had some really funny lines (holy smokes!). this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an an amazing performance from bruce willis and i say its a must see!. the direction is great!. jon turteltaub does a great job here with really good camera work, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. the acting is excellent!. bruce willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his best comedic performances, is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both spencer breslin and emily mortimer, had some funny lines, and was dead on throughout the movie, he was one of the main reasons i liked this movie so much! (willis rules!!!!!!!). spencer breslin is fantastic as the younger version of russell, he was very funny and didn't get on my nerves once, he is one of the better child actors out there!. emily mortimer is good as amy and was really cute i liked her she had decent chemistry with bruce too. lily tomlin is funny as janet i liked her quite a bit. jean smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. rest of the cast do fine. overall a must see!. **** out pf 5
