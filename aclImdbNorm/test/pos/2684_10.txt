this is the best comedy period. it is so underrated! clever witty humor, great casting! jerry stiller is the jewel in the show, he is so incredibly funny and quirky, simply a comical genius! doug and carrie have great chemistry! i so do not see what the hype is about when it comes to everybody loves raymond it is so overrated with lame jokes mostly forced humor and just not the witty show, i can't remember laughing in more than 1 episode. king of queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs which is normally caused by arthur spooner, i think its about time this comedy gets the hype it deserves and not the lame raymond & co.
