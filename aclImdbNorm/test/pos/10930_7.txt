the mere presence of sam waterston as an indian, is enough to put this movie in the must-see category. he is both beautiful and very subtle, with no lines whatsoever. he is tender with his kidnappee, and yet we can see he is among the proudest of all young indian men. martin sheen is just a dumb cluck who decides to challenge waterston (white bull) for a gorgeous white horse. other sub-plots are really unnecessary. i don't understand the part played by caroline langrishe, as the poor girl who white bull kidnaps...i don't know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful indian man! it's a lot of fun, though; especially if you're a waterston fan. man, he looks good in this one!!! harvey keitel's role isn't even worth mentioning, to tell the truth! but, rent it and enjoy! actually, i do believe that if the music score was better, it would've been a more dramatic film...the music is so bad, it's distracting. still - there's mr. waterston!
