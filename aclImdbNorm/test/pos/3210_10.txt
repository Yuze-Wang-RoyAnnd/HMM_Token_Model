this show is really great. it's smart.it's funny.it's great acting and writing. this show is really the fastest show i've ever seen. the dialogues are really funny and well acted. lauren graham and alexis bledel have a great chemistry.you really do believe they are mother and daughter. this show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with lorelai and emily. just watch this show i highly recommend it.it's great and definitely the best show on the air. season 7 stars tuesday september 26th, 2006, 8/7c on the new the cw
