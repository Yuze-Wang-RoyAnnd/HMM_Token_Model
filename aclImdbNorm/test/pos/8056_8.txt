having been brought up in phenix city as a child, i recognize many of the local people in the movie, so for me, it's like a trip down memory lane to see "the phenix city story" again. as a matter of fact, my granduncle is in it in one of the very first scenes. uncle drew's the one in the hawaiian shirt who scoots his chair out to get a better look at the singer/stripper.<br /><br />unless you've been there, like mr. page and i both have, you couldn't possibly understand the story it tells. the reviewer from new york calls john patterson racist, most likely without ever having had an encounter with mr. patterson or his father. and what is your point in bringing up mr. patterson's employment now? it has nothing to do with the film that you're supposedly reviewing. how in the world can you sit back and judge either them or this film when you've probably gone no further yourself than the south bronx? it's been my experience that people who do that are simply attempting to feel morally superior to the folks portrayed in the movie. by most accounts of the time, both mr. pattersons were basically good and decent men. their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in phenix city.<br /><br />by the way, why is so hard for those who live outside of the south to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in alabama? and why do they assume that everyone living in a small southern town is a racist? my parents lived there and yet, they didn't tolerate it in our household. others didn't tolerate it either, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives on through the willful ignorance of others.<br /><br />the movie itself is simple and direct. it isn't the whole story --- hollywood added a certain sensationalism when the film was made. parts of it were absolutely on target. other parts of it bordered on fairy tales. and if it's the source that anyone uses to decide how folks in small southern towns are, they need to get a grip and understand what most of us do --- it's only a movie.
