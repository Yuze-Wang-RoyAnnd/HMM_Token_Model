"the falcon and the snowman" is the story of two young men, a cia employee and a drug dealer, who become disenchanted with united states foreign policy and sell state secrets to the soviet union. the events of the film are based on a true story.<br /><br />timothy hutton and sean penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations. the supporting cast also performs well, notably with a performance from david suchet of hercule poirot fame as a seasoned soviet agent.<br /><br />the film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in. however, it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle. the ending, however, is tense, stunning and effective. there are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with a spy story. there are other spy films more worth seeking out than "the falcon and the snowman", but it is a decent film none the less.
