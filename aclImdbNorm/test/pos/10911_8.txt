while amiable and amusing for gay audiences, frank oz's film "in and out," about a closeted gay teacher who has been outed on national television by a former student, has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers that patronized "the bird cage." although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the movie revolves around kevin kline's howard brackett, who is a grossly stereotyped gay man. the movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music, revel in barbra streisand movies, and dress well indicates one's sexual orientation. like "queer eye," the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly, dim witted, and lacking in taste and culture. ok, so "in and out" is only a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt.<br /><br />unfortunately, at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character. howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self-denial, and evidently has never had a sex life. a three-year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks, and watching "funny lady." fortunately, joan cusack plays howard's intended, emily montgomery, and she steals the show throughout. most of the film's funniest moments belong to her, although kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious. he is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. matt dillon also stands out as the student turned actor, and the clip from his oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. however, despite the movie's gay theme, there is no boy-meets-boy romance, and only one male-to-male kiss, and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between michael and fredo corleone in "godfather ii." <br /><br />although well intentioned, "in and out" fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials, yet little outrage is expressed. most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about howard's self-realization, which seems to take place overnight, and his abrupt and unjust dismissal. not surprisingly, howard's parents, endearingly portrayed by debbie reynolds and wilford brimley, and his students rise to support him. however, the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to howard brackett in the film. the movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob, was a rabid fan of football, drove a station wagon, listened to country music, and lived on fast food. despite some good performances and funny situations, "in and out" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether they be positive or negative, stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history.
