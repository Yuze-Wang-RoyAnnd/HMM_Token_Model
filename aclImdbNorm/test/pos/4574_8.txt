i would have to say this is a great movie. <br /><br />mike judge has an eye forseeing things that nobody would ever notice hence office space. hemakes a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years. that pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day. yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across. but the genuine frustration on private joe bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives. <br /><br />if you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again. it took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it is
