what's fun about barker's nightbreed is that it's the story of a human on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. in this one, the monsters (the night breed of the title) are the "good" guys. it shares its sense of celebrating the different, the twisted, and the dark with the first addams family movie, and much of tim burton's work. it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barker.<br /><br />especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed. as happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks. only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with guns and bombs. and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.<br /><br />this isn't a masterpiece, and even barker has done more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work. but it's pure fun, it looks great, and remains light without mocking itself. worth a look!
