my original title for this review was going to be, "ending disappoints, film triumphs." but i actually thought about this one on the way home. it is not the fairy tale most of these films are, it takes turns that are different and while its ending is at first disappointing, it slowly sinks in and hits the core on a satisfying tone.<br /><br />the plot follows a man named james aaron(curb your enthusiasm's jeff garlin, who also wrote and directed) a struggling actor who lives in chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity and his inability to find someone to love.<br /><br />yes, it sounds corny, but it experiments with elements that make it somewhat unpredictable, and actually makes you wish it were longer. the ending came kind of abruptly and had me saying, "that's it!?" but once it starts to take it's toll, it really makes you smile.<br /><br />it does have many tones of seriousness throughout, but fear not, for it is also very funny. some scenes offer huge laughs, and those who have seen jeff garlin's stand-up will recognize a couple (primarily when he gives a speech at career day for his niece's kindergarten class and bombs). it begins on somewhat of a serious note that you do not expect, but what follows is very funny, entertaining, and quite poignant as well. it is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy. and as i said before, while the ending may seem absurd at first, once you take time to think about, it is a true joy.
