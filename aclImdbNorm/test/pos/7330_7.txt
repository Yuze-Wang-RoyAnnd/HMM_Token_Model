i like this movie. i may be biased because i love dolphins. however, my 3 and 4 yr. old will sit and watch the whole movie.... it's not oscar material, but definitely entertaining. the dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. my favorite scene is when flipper "flips" the pop can out of the water striking sandy in the head. it's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time. on the other hand, the villainous banterings of the bully boatman (forget his name) are a little hard to take. and the shark scene is far from reality. question: do dolphins really make that much noise? or is there some serious dubbing happening here? bottom line: my kids like it and it keeps recycling through our vcr.
