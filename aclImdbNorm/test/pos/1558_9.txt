fantastic film! wow - this is really a treat. i can't believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie. <br /><br />a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an rv, after she has a flat at a rest stop. however she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them.<br /><br />everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you.<br /><br />newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute, yet somewhat shy alice. emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film. i'm sure we'll be seeing emily in more films in the future.<br /><br />contrary to what some others have said, the lighting and photography in this were just perfect. the editing was done well too - just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road trip.<br /><br />i didn't see it on the big screen, but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it. more films like this are *exactly* what we need.<br /><br />sf
