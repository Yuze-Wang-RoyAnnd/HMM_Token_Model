alexander nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to lamentation and end in a triumphal cantata. the story takes place in 1242. prince alexander nevsky (nikolai cherkasov) defeats the teutonic knights in a battle on the ice of lake peipus.<br /><br />the film is a splendid historical pageant which shows director sergei eisenstein at his most inventively pictorial, and climaxes in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. several films have scenes strongly influenced by the battle of lake peipus, including doctor zhivago (1965), mulan (1998), and king arthur (2004). alexander nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds, and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential soviet-made historical film.
