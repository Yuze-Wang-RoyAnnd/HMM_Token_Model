the folks at aardman have done a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and gromit to feature length, as the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. in this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet english village. in particular for mrs. tottington (or 'totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to the chagrin of victor quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle. wallace and gromit seem to have success with their machine, but wallace has a mix-up: a machine he's made to make more food suddenly criss-crosses himself with a rabbit - the curse is on! <br /><br />a lot of this is about as much light-hearted fun that a kid's movie could ask for, but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick: looney tunes, which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville. granted, the aardman guys (nick park and steve box) have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. it's never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use, even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny "ho-ho" not funny "ha-ha" side (a tired criticism but i'll say it). curse of the were-rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition (the golden bullet story is a doozy), park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the material.<br /><br />it's fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely off-the-wall for the kids (even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets, such as the truck wallace and gromit drive around in), and for adults there's little barbs of funky, absurdist tones in the midst of a classic english farce. only (and i'm probably a minority opinion here) when compared to chicken run it's almost a little slight a work- there's less any plot than there is a series of running gags, and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns like the fiennes voiced quartermaine). but when it strikes best, it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005. it gives me a big goofy smile anytime it's on tv.
