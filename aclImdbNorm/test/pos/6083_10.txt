i watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences i ever had and it really left a mark inside me.at first i didn't quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewer.<br /><br />years after i first watched i managed to watch it again and this was the time that i fell in love with 'the english patient', it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made.<br /><br />anthony minghella made an absolutely stunning film, all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside you.<br /><br />of course, the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it.<br /><br />but personally the best thing was the fragile performance that ralph fiennes gave in this masterpiece. he plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with katherine clifton,opens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair.<br /><br />the most heart-breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt katherine is carried by almasy towards the cave of swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought her.she says 'i always wore it.i always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him.<br /><br />juliette binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the oscar she won.<br /><br />overall, this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives.
