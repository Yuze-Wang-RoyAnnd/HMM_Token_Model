nice description of the situation in the us, it explains different kinds of islam, not just show terrorist and extremist. islam can be other thing that killing, they show why some people become terrorist and how to be muslim without being extremist. it is a great series that muslims and no-muslims should see. now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all muslims are terrorist and all americans want to destroy islam. it gave me the interest to discover what islam is exactly and what the us and also european government do to help cohabitation between people of different religion.
