this second pairing of wile e. coyote and the road runner is a great as the first. predictable maybe, but i don't care and still laugh so much whenever i see it. the wile e./road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart. so knowing that the second disc of the golden collection would not only feature 11 of this, but they would be in chronological order (2 through 12, the first episode was on volume 1), made me get misty eyed. i love this stuff. this animated short can be seen on disc 2 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2. it also features an optional commentary by micheal barrier.<br /><br />my grade: a+
