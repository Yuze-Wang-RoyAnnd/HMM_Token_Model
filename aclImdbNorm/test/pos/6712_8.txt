to the guy who hatched the idea for lifeforce i have one thing to say: thank you, sir! lifeforce combines the big-budget sci-fi pomp of star trek: the motion picture with the cheap horror thrills of phantasm and tops it all off with t-ts-- and some real meaty hangers at that..and best of all, it's actually a good movie! it amazes me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie that is a vehicle for a hot chick to appear naked on screen for an hour and a half to producers. god bless you, all of you who were involved.<br /><br />steve railsback (helter skelter) plays col. carlson, the american commander of an international space mission sent to investigate halley's comet. carlson's crew finds an alien vessel inside the comet and inside that they find three naked people in suspended animation--two guys and a hot broad (mathilda may). well, to make a long story short, they're "space vampires"...naked "space vampires." they trash the crew except for col. blueballs who decided that he had to let the hot chick out of her lucite display case because the part of his brain that controls his nut fluids told him it was the right thing to do. the col. wings it back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. meanwhile, another space shuttle crew has discovered his ship floating dead in space and has brought the three space coffins of the living dead martians back to london. and that's when people start turning into pork rinds and s--t in general just starts getting' way out of hand too damn fast.<br /><br />carlson teams up with the unflappable col. caine (peter firth) of the british s.a.s. to track down our naked cutie--who is having one hell of a time sucking guys off left and right. carlson's discovered that he has a mental link with vampira that allows them to track her down, with the ultimate goal being to blow her ass away and wreck her and her pals' big space umbrella that sucks up the energy of the people that the vamps attack. will they succeed in time? minor spoiler: yes.<br /><br />wow. what can i say but "wow"? this damn movie really works. i can't believe they got actual british actors like aubrey morris (a clockwork orange) and patrick stewart (sexiest man alive or some such title) to appear in this film. all the actors are good. direction is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic devastation of london. special effects are no slouch either. for 1985, this movie must've been the s--t as far as fx goes. all the effects are fairly impressive and there's a wide range of talent on display here in animotronics, makeup effects, light shows, and very nice space scenes with some good old-fashioned modeling and matte painting--very nicely done. there's even some gore and bloody squib shots for all the horror fanboys out there.<br /><br />lifeforce is a great film for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular films on the bigsceen were made with 100% love from start to finish. the creators of the movie really made sure all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun affair that doesn't let you turn away because the proceedings are just too good-looking. real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
