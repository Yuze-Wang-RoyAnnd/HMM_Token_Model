i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it. i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is, and how she mostly ruins louden's perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways. as a kid in the 80's i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie, the domain of madonna's character, with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc. now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons, and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms. nikki finn. although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie. pure beauty and genius.
