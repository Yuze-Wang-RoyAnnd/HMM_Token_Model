this sequel proves that tim burton was for all intents and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie. the story focuses on baman taking on three enemies: the penguin (wonderfully played by danny devito) catwoman (the slinky michelle pfeiffer) and max shreck (the superb christopher walken).<br /><br />perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is devito as the multi-layered penguin. here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. the infamous scene with shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. in other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.<br /><br />i do not hesitate to say that "batman returns" is my favorite of all the batmans released (sorry, dark knight fans). if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. <br /><br />if nothing else, it's at least the best film tim burton has ever made.
