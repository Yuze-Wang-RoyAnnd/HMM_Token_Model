the answer.....no, sadly not. though miller and the sweep has to be hailed as a most whimsical cinematic treat.the drama, suspense,romance and the unidentified crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of 1898. a enlightening experience, one for all the family!
