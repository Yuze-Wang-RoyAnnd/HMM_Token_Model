as i have said before, i am not a fan of tweety. he's just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.<br /><br />in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys tweety is one of the passengers. <br /><br />the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. if only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating canary forever. but, as cartoons starring tweety go, this one is quite good, but it's all thanks to that brilliant cat.
