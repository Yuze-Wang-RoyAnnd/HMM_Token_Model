i always liked listening to buddy holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. he wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, chuck berry or jerry lee lewis, but he wasn't far behind. who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. almost every single he put out was a hit.<br /><br />so, i was very pleasantly surprised how good a job gary busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice. he did buddy proud, as were the actors (don stroud and charles martin smith) who played holly's backup group, "the crickets."<br /><br />music-wise, there are some of holly's better-known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as holly and the boys are shown in iowa in their last concert ever. busey not only sings like holly, he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department. some thing was the actor''s best performance ever, and you get no argument from me.<br /><br />i'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that iowa concert, instead of dwelling on his tragic accident. the ending could have been a real downer, but they didn't let it be.
