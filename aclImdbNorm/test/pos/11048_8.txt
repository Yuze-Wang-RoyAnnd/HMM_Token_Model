this film is worthwhile despite what you may hear. the performance of marie dressler (i hope i am spelling it right) as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film. it is an amazing performance. she is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice. you can actually smell the alcohol when she is done. amazing. and greta of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great. the eugene o'neill story is solid and like most o'neill stories, very deep and intense. this is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it. some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile.
