it's really too bad that nobody knows about this movie. i think if it were just spruced up a little and if it weren't so low-budget, i think one of the major film companies might have wanted to take it. i first saw this movie when i was 11, and i thought it was so powerful with the many great, yet illegal lengths that mitchell goes to just to keep his family together. it inspired me then and it amazes me now. if you're lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, don't miss it!
