is it full moon tonight? oh! it doesn't matter they can change whenever they want cuz of that drug! what was i thinking if its full moon tonight?! geez<br /><br />i really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror, and hot stuff ;) i like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and catching her. that was really cool. the setting of this movie is in the city of love which is paris in france. the cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who's behind the walls. the scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool. even they got me on that scenes. his friend who died and the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead character(sorry i forgot his name), was really funny. the actors did a good job plus the make-up crews. the part when they're all partying in an abandoned church, i can't believe people would that because even though that's an abandoned church, that is still god's house. i bought this movie long time ago, and i do not regret buying it. i'm a horror-movie-lover. i give this movie 5 stars out of 6. for the people who are open and loves movies like this, give it a try, you might like it.
