we went to the cinema expecting a biggish budget release and got an art-house movie. the movie was projected digitally onto about two thirds of the screen real estate with sloping edges classic of digital projection, and had a limited stereo soundtrack which was wasted on the cinema experience.<br /><br />the content of the film was the same old historical content we have all seen before, but heavily sanitized to prevent the audience being sick. live action scenes what little of them there were, were re-used constantly in classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while.<br /><br />i was somewhat amazed that only 4 people turned up to watch it, guess the rest knew something we didn't.<br /><br />i suspect the producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth anniversary of gallipoli. i have to question whether they should have bothered.<br /><br />seven out of ten for trying, and out of respect for the anzac's.
