great british director christopher nolan (momento, insomnia), directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people. this proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like-minded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering. the two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution. jeremy theobald plays the writer and alex haw the like-minded friend. both are great performances. this low budget movie was shot total guerrilla-style with no permits for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films don't have which is a clever script and creative direction. an impressive debut by one of todays best directors. good stuff!
