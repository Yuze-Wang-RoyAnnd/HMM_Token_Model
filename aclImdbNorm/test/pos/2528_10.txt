i'm originally from brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. they told his life story and he never got one "centavo" (brazilian cent) of that movie. fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in brazil. sad... but that is the world we live in. it's about making money not saving lives. question is: where is fernando today? most probably... dead. we tend to want to live in this "disney filled fantasy bubbled life". when someone comes up to the plate to help... along comes the higher power and says: "what do i get from this? where's my cut?" - i wish people's conscience would speak up!
