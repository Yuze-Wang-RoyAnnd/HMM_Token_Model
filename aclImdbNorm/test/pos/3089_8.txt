fata morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by german filmmaker extraordinaire werner herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare dvds that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. it is a visual feast of north african (mostly saharan) imagery that is timeless. you simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. the soundtrack to the film, including german classical music (mozart and handel), and rock music by blind faith and leonard cohen, also lends its timeless quality. the narration by three different german narrators (german film historian lotte eisner, eugen des montagnes, and wolfgang von ungern-sternberg) is solid, and herzog goes on and on of eisner's import to this project, himself, and film history, but the english speaker of the translation, james william gledhill, has a voice that seems downright deific, which lends itself far more perfectly to this project, even though much of the text- in either language, is rather superfluous. yes, the faux biblical sounds of the popul vuh mayan creation myth in the film's first part, creation, is interesting, but the text herzog wrote for the remaining two parts (paradise and the golden age), along with quotes from a german poet herzog names as manfred eigendorf, almost seems a satire of the first part's somber tone
