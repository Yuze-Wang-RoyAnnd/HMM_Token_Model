alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 british film, "the man who knew too much". this 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one. mr. hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next, thus keeping a standard in his work. robert burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and george tomasini's editing shows his talent. ultimately, bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture.<br /><br />james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr. hitchcock. in this version, he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son. when we meet him, they are on their way to marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins. his wife is the lovely doris day at her best. she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. the film has some good supporting cast, brenda debanzie, bernard miles, daniel gelin, alan mowbray, among others, do a great job in portraying their characters.<br /><br />although this is a "light hitchcock", one can't dismiss it as a failure. "the man who knew too much" is a change of pace for hitchcock's fans.
