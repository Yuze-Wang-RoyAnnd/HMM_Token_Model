i thought this film was amazing and i laughed so much that i had to see it twice to catch the bits i missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! the critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an iq over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my iq is approx:135...i challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! this film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!!<br /><br />the musical numbers were so imaginative! everyone when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to today's attire and how funny we would find today's male population if they wore tights day in day out! the idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone not laugh!!! (plus also, seeing hip-hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical-as a dancer also, i've done ballet and hip hop and danced with men who've had to do both....it still cracks me up each time!!!)<br /><br />i love this film, if anyone hasn't seen it yet, don't listen to the critic above...watch it and then decide for yourself!!!
