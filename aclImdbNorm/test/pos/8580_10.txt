*warning! some spoilers!*<br /><br />matt, a rich writer, is in fact still just a boy in his behaviour. he doesn't care about anyone's but his own needs and couldn't care less about the consequences of any of his actions. just as he gets to know nimi and her bonds with her familiy and her communitiy he starts to feel that something is missing in his live.<br /><br />he starts to realize that he is in fact lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are just convenient but lack heart and commitment. nevertheless he shies away from any responsibilties and is reluctant to change his live. but will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he's already - unconsciously - formed?<br /><br />nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. she is pressed into the regulations of her nigerian community, its prejudices and its medieval values. being a single mother her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with matt, a white devil (as the referend would say), a man who cannot commit. the women of the community plan to marry her to the referend to end her single status and give sammy "a name". but that would mean for nimi to give up all independence and self-determination. but is there an alternative for her if she wants sammy to be accepted and herself to become a respected member of the community?<br /><br />this movie has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with very sexy scenes of matt and nimi) and an endearing child who is eagerly matchmaking, a beautiful scenery in lively colours.<br /><br />colin firth (*swoon*) and nia long show a great chemistry. it's just fantastic to watch them. and fissy roberts as sammy is just to die for. you simply want to adopt him. i just love the way sammy and matthew talk to each other. they are both on the same level in many ways. especially when sammy asks matt about sex. this scene is absolutely adorable!!<br /><br />almost nothing to complain about.... wait! that's not true. one thing is not good: that the movie is not long enough! (well, and maybe that the referend is too bad and too silly to be convincing....)<br /><br />10 of 10, by all means!
