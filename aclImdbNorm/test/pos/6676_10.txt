a beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and heart-warming story. excellent direction, perfect cast, marvellous script, excellent score, beautifully lit...... need i say more?<br /><br />if you love films that not only make you think but also warm your heart (some that spring to mind are 'contact', 'field of dreams' and 'groundhog day') then you're sure to love k-pax.<br /><br />most highly recommended.
