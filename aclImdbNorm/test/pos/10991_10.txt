as a native of the city where the story takes place, buffalo, ny, it's fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun, too!<br /><br />the small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves. please make this film the success the big, fat greek wedding was.
