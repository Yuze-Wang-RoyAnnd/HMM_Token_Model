i would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. i just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces sinuoeh, the lead character. i remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time i saw it. apparently, she was a holocaust refugee, discovered by a french husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. she died very young and under tragic circumstances. gene tierney is also outstanding in this film. like other neo-biblical films of the 1940's and 50s, "the egyptian" reflects the morals and values of that time, but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told.
