hayao miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser ponyo on the cliff by the sea, his latest animated film, which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off. i thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic, and i didn't have to wait for an invite to make sure i got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie, scheduled to open here next week.<br /><br />for fans of studio ghibli films, you'll probably know what you're in for, as miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography, that will win new fans over. i'm embarrassed to say the least that i've so far watched only my neighbour totoro (eyes that pile of ghibli dvds) and love it to bits, but i guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that i would enjoy.<br /><br />ponyo (voiced by nara yuria) is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea, with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek. nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad fujimoto (tokoro joji), who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution, and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection / revenge by mother nature as well. an accident one day sees ponyo being washed ashore, and picked up by five year old boy sosuke (doi hiroki) who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother lisa (yamaguchi tomoko), while dad koichi (nagashima kazushige) is mostly out to sea since he's a sailor. and you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of the little mermaid, or splash made for kids. saying anything more would be to spoil the fun.<br /><br />the artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in 2d glory, knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on. there are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame, that you'll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all. this definitely beats any 3d or cg animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity, and not only from the artwork department, but on its story too, despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the hans christian andersen classic. while there are avenues to make this film extremely dark, it only suggested certain dark themes, but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both kids and adults alike.<br /><br />at its core, its about love, that between the family members of koichi, lisa and sosuke, and especially between mother and son. more so, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened ponyo, and i tell you ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of bolt, walle and eve all hands down. characterization here is top notch, and it's hard not to fall in love with ponyo, in whichever form adopted, especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions - if she's upset with you, either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face!<br /><br />ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a definite shoo-in to my top films of this year without hesitation. and the next time i go to tokyo, i'm sure as hell going to make my way to the ghibli museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by hayao miyazaki. highly recommended film, so don't you go missing this on the big screen!
