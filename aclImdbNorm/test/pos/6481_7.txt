i watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in airlie beach qld australia. i had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most don't bother to browse.<br /><br />to my pleasure i found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection. i still do not have it but will one day.<br /><br />i like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy. the semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effect.<br /><br />i have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre, with nothing but praise. it has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to come.<br /><br />i fully recommend this film, but only to those that are into this type.<br /><br />this comment and the one from la,ca can assist you when choosing to watch this film. the comments may be negative but i found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation.
