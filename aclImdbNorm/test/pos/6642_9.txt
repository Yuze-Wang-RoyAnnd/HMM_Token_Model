i watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. i didn't know what to expect precisely, and for the first ten minutes i feared i might not enjoy this film. it was beginning very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read.<br /><br />but i definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it. it is one of the most beautiful bergman movies i've ever seen, at the same time human, ruthless and psychologically so convincing.<br /><br />seldom have i seen actors play so wonderfully, with such an intensity on their faces : liv ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and sydow is excellent too.<br /><br />there is always psychological violence in bergman movies, and this one may be the most physically violent of them all. the strained relationships between the man and the woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding them...<br /><br />finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. an excellent bergman.<br /><br />
