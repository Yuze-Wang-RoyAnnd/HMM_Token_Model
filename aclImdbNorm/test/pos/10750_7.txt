this film would be considered controversial today, but is still very funny. the racial stereotyping is done from the view of humor & not hate. this film strips off & shows how corrupt politicians already were in the early 1930's. this film proves it started before the 1970's & beyond when it has accelerated in the united states. lloyd is still in his typical genre here, even though his character was raised in china. <br /><br />the meaning of a cat's paw in this instance is a person who is running for political office but is being used by the established political machine to advance their agenda. in other words, they think this guy (lloyd)is harmless when he runs for office. then when he gets elected, he surprises them.<br /><br />this same theme is used later in james stewarts film mr. smith goes to washington. stewarts is more famous & has a stronger message. this film is more clever & subtle which are harold lloyds trademarks. <br /><br />there is still the heart of romantic comedy hidden with the facade of the movie but today's mainstream audiences would still appreciate the political humor & the ending is absolutely priceless. i wish someone could beat today's political system in this way. i was surprised how much i enjoyed this film & find myself wishing harold had done more like it during the 1930's. <br /><br />at least we have this one. i think the person who is quoted most in the movie is fictional ling po. i always thought confusicus was the wise one but this one makes me believe the wisdom of china was not limited to him & is a vast field of comedy lloyd mined in this movie.
