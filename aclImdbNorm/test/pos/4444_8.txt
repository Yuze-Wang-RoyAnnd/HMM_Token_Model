i'm not a huge fan of lucio fulci's films. most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate dario argento imitations. with the exception of the entertaining "zombi" (which was a george romero imitation), i didn't really enjoy them. i know italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. this is why "don't torture a duckling" surprised me. its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery. its possibly the best giallo ever made, only seriously rivaled by dario argento's entries into the genre. and unlike fulci's previous giallo "a lizard in a woman's skin", this never drags.<br /><br />fulci's direction here is quite good. he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer's interest throughout. also, the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience. plus, he adds some clever touches, such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence. overall, the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story. the acting is good for the most part also, full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema. both thomas milian and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout. the only weak link is florinda bolkan, whose performance is just far too over-the-top. its the only laughable aspect of the film. "don't torture a duckling" definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
