i'll make this brief. this was a joy to watch. it may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life counterparts, but aside from this minor observation i found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable. the visuals were most stunning except for the second-rate cg scenes, which could have been left out. i dislike computer generated animation anyways, it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one. watch it, you will appreciate it too!
