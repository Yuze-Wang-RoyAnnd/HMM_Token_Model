i've always liked barbara stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. today she is remembered most for the tv show "the big valley". stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence.<br /><br />and so it was for "christmas in connecticut" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about christmas. it does, however, have stanwyck and dennis morgan as well as some supreme character actors including sydney greenstreet and s.k. sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. to begin, the plot concerns a magazine writer (stanwyck) who the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess, married with a child and living on a farm in connecticut but who is really single, lives in new york city and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking. could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (greenstreet) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and stanwyck, greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (morgan) and stanwyck's restaurateur friend (s.z.sakall) find themselves spending christmas in connecticut at a farm belonging to stanwyck's boorish boyfriend (reginald gardiner). you can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must. gardiner wants stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all. morgan and stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married. regardless, they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh. meanwhile, the incredibly naive greenstreet character who has seen stanwyck and morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping. stanwyck and morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind.<br /><br />at this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha,ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did. the good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after.<br /><br />i watch this movie every year at christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with barbara stanwyck. thank goodness it was set at christmas or like 95 percent of stanwyck's movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew.
