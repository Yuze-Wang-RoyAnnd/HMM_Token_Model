this thriller is one of the few (film) surprises i've had in quite some time. everybody - and i do mean everybody - i talked to when it was in the theatres said it was awful...but then i got to thinking...none of these people really understand horror/thriller films or metal rock - so why do i listen to them in the first place????? this film kicks ass - but only if you are able to comprehend and enjoy this type of entertainment. in short (too late) - see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind. ...the soundtracks great too...
