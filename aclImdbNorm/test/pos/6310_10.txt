well, where do i start...<br /><br />as one of the other reviewers said, you know you're in for a real treat when you see the opening shot - minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelator.<br /><br />i won't repeat rubin's excellent summary of the story. what i would like to say, though, is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember. i sat open-mouthed, and on the edge of my seat all the way through. the camera work, sound track and *fantastic* performances (particularly that of tony servillo) draw you to the screen and won't let you look away.<br /><br />it's italian, so of course everyone looks fantastic, but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style. this is a film with lots to say about luck, loss and love.<br /><br />go and see it.
