in 1961, this series was shown on local tv here in southern california. i and many others have been petering bbc for tape or dvd ever since. now all of a sudden, here it is on amazon. i pre-ordered in january and now here on march 30 it arrived. it was a long wait (48 years). was it worth it? so far i have just watched richard ii (i've only had the dvd since 2 o'clock) and i can truly say yea!!! totally worth the wait. the acting, direction, and production are superb and even better than i remember. the production is in b & w but somehow it fits. the video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. further proof of how timeless shakespeare truly is.<br /><br />i gave this 10 stars even though i have only seen 1 of the 8 plays. i am sure that when i have seen them all i will change my rating to at least a 12.<br /><br />it's currently in stock at amazon (us region 1) at a reasonable price.<br /><br />i'd better stop now so i can get back to watching. next up is henry the iv, part 1 of which is my all time favorite shakespeare play.
