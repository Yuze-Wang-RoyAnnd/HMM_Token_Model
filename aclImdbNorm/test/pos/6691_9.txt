due to a very misleading advertising campaign, i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10. the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy, and i bugged my parents until they took me. after seeing the movie, i was blown away. i had no idea what to think. totally different than anything i had seen before, leaving far to many questions for such a young mind. needless to say, i loved it. this morning was the first time i'd watched in in probably 2-3 years, and i still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. the supporting cast are near perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. the open ending was handled very well, giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end. how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's oscars is beyond me. if you haven't seen this film, run to wal-mart right now. the dvd is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up! <br /><br />9.5/10
