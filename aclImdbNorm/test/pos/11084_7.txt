i am not a fan of sean penn, but in contrast to my german colleague whose review appears here, i think he was perfectly cast as the neurotic, druggy character in this film. he has every nuance perfected and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in "recreational chemistry." i saw this film but once, 10-15 years ago and this is the only part of the film that was etched indelibly on my mind. i don't say it very often, but in this case i will: bravo, sean penn! as for the story line, well, it's based on fact, and as such, it is a tragedy that people would sell their country's secrets to the then enemy. again, penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration. use the freedoms you have, paid for in blood; don't break the law.
