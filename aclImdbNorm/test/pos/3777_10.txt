mark blankfield played jekyll and hyde.<br /><br />michael mcguire was the dad.<br /><br />tim thomerson was the plastic surgeon.<br /><br />did you even see this movie? i doubt it!<br /><br />blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on fridays. thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it. i recorded this movie off of hbo back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. one of the funniest takes on the jekyll & hyde theme ever.<br /><br />of course. with all the cocaine references in this movie, it'd be panned as being way too politically incorrect today, as would cheech and chong. too bad, because it is funny, funny, funny!
