i loved complete savages! why did they cancel it anyway? they should have made a second season and so on... god! they always cancel the good shows... and leave all the boring stuff. nothing interesting at tv since complete savages is gone. this show was a great idea. a single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog... each and every one of them has his own madness in that house. tj is always the kid...always the smaller one... kyle rocks! he breaks everything he touches! he's always on detention, he's always doing the wrong stuff... but still, he's so funny by all the things that he does. sam is the smart one. he's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls... finally he ends up by dating angela. chris is the sports guy who doesn't have much to do with school, studying, and stuff like that. he's always funny. and finally... jack! the rock of the show. the oldest of all, the macho guy, "the rock star"... but still, as crazy as everybody else. nick is...helpless with these guys. oh! and i almost forgot! uncle jimmy... he's the man! he's like a 30 year old kid. he's like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing. i always wondered how did he end up by being a firefighter... and the dog is the image of all the savage family. the thing is... this show had everything to become something really big. it had everything, man! but, of course...they canceled it...
