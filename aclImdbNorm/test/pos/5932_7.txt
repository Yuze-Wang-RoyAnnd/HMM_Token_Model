this royal rumble basically had the message of wrestling these days. gimmick and image are more popular then wrestling ability.<br /><br />hbk vs edge. pretty good match. a lot of heat for edge who was just starting out as a heel again and what better way to go into a match with hbk. it kind of got a little slower at the end then usual. overall this match gets a 6/10. undertaker vs hedinreich. not a good match. undertaker had to carry hedinreich through this match who seemed to be really lost and screwed up his moves. it did get interesting to see raws gene snitsky and a bit later kane come into this match. overall the fans seemed more interested when this match ended. 2/10 kurt angle vs jbl vs big show. this match was slow at first but got pretty good at the end when angle managed to speed up the match.kurt angle did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match. jbl and big show put on a slow match. the ending to this match was bad. over all this match was a 5/10 mainlly because of kurt angle. randy orton vs hhh. good match,surprising heat for randy orton who was the face in this match. randy proved he can go the limit with any top star. this match also marked the first match hhh has wrestled where someone dosn't run down and save him from a loss. over all this match was about a 6/10.<br /><br />royal rumble match was ok. some surprises. some not so good surprises. i was kind of upset that kurt angle wasn't given enough time in this match. but over all this match had a guy who i never thought would be pushed so soon. i won't tell ya who wins. i give this match a 8/10
