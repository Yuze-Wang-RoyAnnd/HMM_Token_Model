in a morocco completely invaded by europeans and americans, in the beginning of the twentieth century, the moroccan leader mulay achmed mohammed el-raisuli the magnificent (sean connery) kidnaps the american eden pedecaris (candice bergen), her son and her daughter. his intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt sultan of moroco (marc zuber). in times of election, the american president theodore roosevelt (brian keith) agrees with the proposal. however, raisuli is betrayed and eden helps him to be released from the prison with the american soldiers. i do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect to the sovereignty of other countries, but `the lion and the wind' is indeed a great adventure. the action scenes are very realistic. candice bergen, the most beautiful american actress in the 70's, is wonderful, performing an abducted woman like in the remarkable movie `soldier blue'. sean connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. brian keith is great as the american president. i do not know much about the morocco history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. in brazil it is only available on vhs. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): `o vento e o le~ao' (`the lion and the wind')<br /><br />
