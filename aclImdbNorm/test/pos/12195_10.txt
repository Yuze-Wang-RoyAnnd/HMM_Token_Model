although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. it's great campy fun with the beautiful stuart townsend as lestat. he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and lestat is most definitely about looking good. he moves like the predator i always imagined lestat would have.<br /><br /> the visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. it's not interview with the vampire, so don't try to compare the two. interview is louis' story. this is a cut and paste version of lestat's. in any case, i highly recommend.
