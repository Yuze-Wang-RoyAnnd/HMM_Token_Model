if you want to see what could be classed as the 'stage' version of gypsy this is the film for you.<br /><br />if you enjoy(ed) listing to the merman recording of gypsy then you really enjoy watching midler as gypsy's mother, rose. it's my opinion that midler has the volume, vibrato and presents that merman once had.<br /><br />it's not often these days, when listening to update versions of musicals, that i get that tingling sensation that makes the hair on my neck tingle but bette midler certainly shows her talents in this movie -see how you like them apples.....<br /><br />i know you may not like it, but for me ms. midler is the definitive "gypsy".
