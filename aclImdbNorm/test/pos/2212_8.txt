i have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. the acting was very good by everyone involved. amy madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired, yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. yet, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism.<br /><br />the men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. christopher lloyd, in a very understated role, shows us why he has such versatility. he plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research, yet starved for a meaningful relationship. he and madigan connect very well in their scenes together, yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship. their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant, an acting lesson for aspiring performers.<br /><br />and in a small role, fred savage is fun to watch.<br /><br />you can tell why this movie was based on a play, it's probably very good on stage. on screen, it's not particularly exciting, but it's nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
