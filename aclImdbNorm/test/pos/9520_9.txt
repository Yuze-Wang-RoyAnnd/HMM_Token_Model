or at least you feel pretty high after this movie. it's the kind of film that the word "rollicking" really can be applied to, though it's rollicking in that entirely casual, intelligent, and open-minded way that belongs to the french.<br /><br />no, catherine deneuve does not spend the entire movie high (sorry to disappoint any puritans with an agenda).. but the one scene to which i refer involves all the members of a wedding party - and it's a musical number! anyway, everything fits pretty seamlessly together, and the unusual, bright, colorful family ( deneuve's mother is a lesbian, deneuve her bon vivant daughter) alternately entertain and annoy us as real families do..but since it's a movie they mostly entertain.<br /><br />don't want to say too much about the ending, but deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger. this is entirely believable as we see the relationship develop over time, and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together. the ending is a happy one; and like the rest of the movie, satisfyingly quirky as well as pitch-perfect.
