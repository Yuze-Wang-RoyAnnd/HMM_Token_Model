chucky's back...and it's about time! this time, with the help of jennifer tilly and a little spell from voodoo for dummies. well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. this was the more gruesome of this series, so far. it has some good twists and some good action scenes. <br /><br />this one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. <br /><br />i am looking forward to seed of chucky. it'll be a hoot!<br /><br />"jesus, the music scene's gone to h3ll since i've been dead!" chucky<br /><br />we needed the levity, as the doll thing's getting old. the added comedic element, and the better action scenes brings this one back up to equal the quality of the first, when the idea was fresh and new-ish.<br /><br />6.8/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
