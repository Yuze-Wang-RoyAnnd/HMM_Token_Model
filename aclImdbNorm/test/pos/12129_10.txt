"let me ask you one more question" ha ! what a great soon .. this movie was brilliant fantastic acting, great script. the only reason no-one noticed it was because of the low budget everyone will agree with me that its a cult just like "donnie brasco" it shows a young joe pesci once again as a mobster, this film is up their with the cults. its got some sopranos and some goodfellas chase got his idea for the sopranos when he watched this and scorsese found joe pesci while watching it, that proves it must be a great am i right or am i wrong 'eh ?. i've got to admit they showed one brilliant scene where they were throwing peanuts at a camp piano player "stop with the friggen peanuts".
