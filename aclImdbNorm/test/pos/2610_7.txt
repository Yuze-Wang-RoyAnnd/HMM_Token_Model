"please, don't kill me! i'm just an actor!" "can you play dead?" it's difficult to describe this show. it's like a crime dramedy. where the bad cop is an ass. literally. what's great about the show is some of assy's perfectly awful one-liners. cracking out such gems as "adios, blimp," assy mcgee provides some great laughs at points. sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch. this is definitely the kind of show you'll love or hate, there's essentially no middleman. it's not the best show on {adult swim}, but it has some strong points. it's worth looking into just to see if you enjoy it. i know i did.
