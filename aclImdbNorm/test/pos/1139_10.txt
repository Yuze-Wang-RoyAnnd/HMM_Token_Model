if you listen to ween (the pod, god/satan), then you know what's going on with "split" i found that watching the film under the influence of lsd helped to deal with audio/video tracers from fantastic editing job. the plot was only important from second to second. the acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. don't bother writing about something out of your comprehension's reach...there just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw , amateur level. i dare anyone to make a movie that can equally mess with my head and change the way i look at visual arts and the world's reality. not to mention the many realities that haven't yet been explored by this humans mind. i love the vision of chris shaw. i also appreciate the texturing terroristic film "the begotten" by e. elias merhige.
