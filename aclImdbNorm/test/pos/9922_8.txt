this is standard fare from a director who as long been amongst my favourites.<br /><br />even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of his other work but its argento and this may be biased but i'm gonna be giving it a good review anyway.<br /><br />it does contain a lot of good ideas. the subtle voyeuristic element. the needles under the eyes. the gory and disturbing deaths. and the argento clich'e flashback.<br /><br />downsides include the heavy metal soundtrack, acting and the ending.<br /><br />all the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the end.<br /><br />a fairly good film from argento but he as done better. a lot better!
