this was a great movie! it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy. so what makes a movie great? technical details? i think that if that were the sole criteria, our culture would be the poorer for it. so this movie is to "the godfather" as new wave music is to mozart. the point is, it is one of the best movies of it's type i've seen. the women are all beautiful (as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made). it has a little of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets wayne's world. there is plenty of charm and a reasonable (albeit predictable) storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen. joe estevez may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud. contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in. (was that intentional?) if you're attracted to the box, rent the video, you won't regret it. as is promised, it is good non-violent erotic fun!
