in france, xavier (romain duris) is a young economist of twenty and something years, trying to get a job in a governmental department through a friend of his father. he is advised to have a specialization in spanish economy and language to get a good position. he decides to apply in an european exchange program called "erasmus" and move to barcelona to improve his knowledges in spanish culture and language. she leaves his girlfriend martine (audry tautou), promising to keep a close contact with her, and once in barcelona, he is temporarily lodged by a french doctor jean-michel (xavier de guillebon) and his young and lonely wife anne-sophie (judith godr`eche) he had met in the airport. later, he moves to an apartment with international students: the english wendy (kelly reilly), the spanish soledad (cristina brondo), the italian alessandro (f'ed'erico d'anna), the danish lars (christian pagh) and the german tobias (barnaby metschurat). then the belgium isabelle (c'ecile de france) and wendy's brother william (kevin bishop) join the group, and xavier learns spanish language, and finds friendship and love in his experience living abroad. "l' auberge espagnole" is one of those movies the viewer becomes sad when it ends. the story is a delightful and funny tale of friendship and love, in a globalized world and an unified europe. this very charming movie made me feel good and happy, although i have never experienced to live in a republic of students. the newcomer william provokes the funniest situations along the story, with his big mouth and short brain. further, it great to see a fresh approach of students living together different from those dumb american fraternities and their stereotypes, common in american movies. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "albergue espanhol" (spanish auberge")
