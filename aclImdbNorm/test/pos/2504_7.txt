aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in rockport ma, which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and i spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and cute little film. <br /><br />i must admit that i had no desire to actually see this movie even though i have a weakspot for romantic comedies (i don't know why). the trailers i saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and i had no idea what the plot would be about. in the end i found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family. i thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that i thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year. i am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very "human-ness" that this movie presented the viewer with.<br /><br />i have read many bad reviews of this film, and must admit a certain level of shock at the cynicism that is prevalent in them. as a grad student i consider myself to be quite cynical, but this was a beautiful little film that deserves much better than it got.
