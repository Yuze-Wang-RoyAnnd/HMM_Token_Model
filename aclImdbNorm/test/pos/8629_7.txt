so i guess that bud and lou just liked to mess with classic stories (although they did have some interesting results). in this case, they're baby-sitting a bad boy, and lou tries to read him "jack and the beanstalk" but falls asleep and dreams that he's jack and bud's the butcher, and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and princess from the giant (buddy baer).<br /><br />i think that my favorite scene was when lou was trying to make the giant an omelet, and...well, i'll let you see what happens. as this was an abbott and costello movie, they did have a few unnecessary songs, but other than that, it was pretty funny. for other interpretations of the classic story, "bewitched" and "gilligan's island" both had episodes portraying it.
