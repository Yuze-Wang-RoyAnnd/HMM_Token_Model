robin hood; men in tights is worth watching, i recently watched it because i've just become a cary elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. some moments really made me crack up so hard! i didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair the cast is great, of course especially robin of locksley himself,cary, but blinkin and the sheriff and little john (don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big! lol) and everyone else!<br /><br />there were some moments of course, the film tried to make a comedic scene out of but you don't necessarily laugh at it,.... but ok.<br /><br />this is the second time cary elwes and patrick stewart appeared in a film together by the way, they both worked on "lady jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww.<br /><br />it's definitely worth watching, quite hilarious indeed!
