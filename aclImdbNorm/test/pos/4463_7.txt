i didn't know what to expect when i rented this widescreen dvd. i knew it had a cult following but i had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. don't torture a duckling actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. and after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. one major caveat: i would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read english subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
