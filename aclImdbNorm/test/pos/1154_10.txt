okay,i'm a history buff,and okay,i'm a action film junkie,so of course,this film is on my top ten of all time.i really love the action scenes,and the unique weaponry of the period.i sort of have doubts about fighting two-handed sword from horse-back,and the raisuli sword seems more katana-like than scimitar-like,...oh well,i've never fought from horse back,either.<br /><br />i love the attempts at philosophic proverbs,too.the typical desert tribesman probably couldn't read the koran,so they'd take his word for it.several writers have criticized connery's brogue;well,on vacation as a youth,i met a family of south africans in our west,dinosaur national monument,and although they spoke africaans between themselves(yeah,second generation germans can hear the difference),they spoke english with a scottish brogue.seems that who teaches you affects your pronunciation.scottish missionary?
