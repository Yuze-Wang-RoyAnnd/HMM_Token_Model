michelle pfeiffer and matthew modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy. alec baldwin, who was an up and coming star when the film was made, is a hoot. dean stockwell, in a sendup of john gotti, is hysterical. but mercedes ruehl, as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the movie.<br /><br />jonathan demme, previously known for wacky comedies like "something wild" and "melvin and howard"-proves once again that he is a genius. i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing "silence of the lambs." the performances he evokes from his actors in "married" are inspired, and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride.<br /><br />one of the cutest, most endearing films of the 80's, it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era.
