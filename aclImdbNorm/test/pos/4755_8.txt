buddy manucci(roy scheider, solid in a chance leading role)heads a secret undercover police squad called the seven-ups whose tactics don't necessarily follow the exact ways of the law. they get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press, and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab. buddy has a pal from childhood named vito(tony lo bianco)who swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in nyc. what buddy doesn't know is that vito is hatching a scheme using names from buddy's "check list"(he has this book open taking down notes provided by vito, but doesn't know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mind)to set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two cop-posers, moon(the always-villainous richard lynch)and bo(bill hickman)working with him. when this scheme goes awry, with one of the seven-ups being killed, vito becomes fearful because he knows how buddy can be when he's doggedly after someone..especially when one of his own is murdered.<br /><br />extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through new york city as buddy follows the kidnapping cop-imposter's trying to get them after killing his partner. the film isn't overly complex after the plot is set-up and we realize who is the ring-leader in the scheming of mobsters. scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor. he has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him. the film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime-spree against evil mob families can get cops killed.
