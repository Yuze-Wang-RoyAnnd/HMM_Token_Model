i never realized what a fabulous dancer lana turner was until i saw this movie. she was only 19 years old and gorgeous. what a pleasure to watch her dance with george murphy. the story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. i never tire of watching fred and ginger but lana turner in this movie was just as terrific. i always thought of lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. she should have done more dancing and less of the maddam x and peyton place roles. i had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing. too bad the "academy" doesn't give an "oscar" for dancing.
