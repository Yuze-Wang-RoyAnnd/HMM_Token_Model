'rejseholdet' is one of the best new danish tv-series that i have watched.<br /><br />the series is about the danish police force's unit 1 - a kinda fbi-style team that help solve murder cases all over the country, and the cases they work on, plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives, and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team.<br /><br />i didn't expect much when i started watching this series - i was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it's got both drama and suspense, i love it.
