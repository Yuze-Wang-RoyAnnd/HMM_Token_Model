i rarely watch short films as they only seem to be on late night television and are not publicised enough for me to know which short films are worth while. as the room is an extra feature on the hitcher dvd, it gave me a wonderful opportunity to witness a high quality short with rutger hauer in excellent form.<br /><br />artistically shot in black and white, the room explores a man's obsession with a room he passed by in the early stages of adulthood and is expressed in a documentary/ interview style. the dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman, but is also juxtaposed with ramblings and occasional deficiencies in fluency. this adds great realism and depth to hauer's performance who is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him.<br /><br />the piano music that harry (hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and enhances the touching atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by hauer.<br /><br />hauer proves he is more than just a psychotic hollywood bad guy with this role and perfectly displays his more sensitive side. mattijn hartemink is also effective in the flashback scenes as young harry with a silent role. he shows how affected he is by the music and his disappointment when it goes away.<br /><br />the ending is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many feature length films. a very good effort.
