this is a great movie to look at, since it so nicely directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it, in terms of its story. it's an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the character's motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to what.<br /><br />somehow it doesn't make the movie any less great to watch though. it's made with passion and eye for detail. every aspect about the movie is good looking, such as its settings, costumes and camera-work.<br /><br />also the story still works out as powerful, though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information. guess if you're completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular, this movie will be a perfect one for you to watch.<br /><br />it's somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle, without ever stepping too much in detail. often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth. other than that, this movie is still one fine example of french cinema, despite the fact that it's being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as well.<br /><br />g'erard depardieu is great in his role, though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters. the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one, so this doesn't really ever become a big complaint, other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain points.<br /><br />a great movie that could had been brilliant.<br /><br />8/10
