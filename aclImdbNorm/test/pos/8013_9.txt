after watching this film i experienced a new sensation. i had watched a film in which the lead actor had put in a performance that almost rivaled the legend chevy chase in 'fletch'. this isn't to say that the performances are comparable, but both give practically flawless delivery of their lines. that actor is marc singer! singer is jack ford, the 'droid gunner' of the title, grinding out a living collecting the bounty on androids.there are some mutants, topless pleasure droids(!), a scandinavian smuggler, and possibly a half-hearted attempt to make a statement on class or maybe even globalization or......... well it doesn't really matter. what matters about this film is the dry manner in which singer delivers his lines resulting in side-splitting humour! what matters about this film is that director fred olen ray seems to realize that serious sci-fi very rarely works, and when your budget is skimpy it is best not to take yourself to seriously. olen ray has said that everyone involved in this film had great fun and this transfers onto the film.i dare you to criticize a film that allows itself to portray futuristic earth as eternally dark and neon-lit and then ends in a 'pipes and valves' warehouse. self parody is a very redeeming quality. to summarise, fred olen ray is an ambassador for independent film making and marc singer the perfect b-movie lead.if only olen ray could draft in tim thomerson to the equation then we'd have a film on our hands.
