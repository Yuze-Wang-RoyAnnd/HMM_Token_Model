i've loved this movie since the first time i saw it lo these many years ago. i'm not sure how many times i've seen it, perhaps 10, perhaps 20. this last time i watched it i was struck by a detail that i hadn't noticed before.<br /><br />toward the end of the picture, the slain heroes are conveyed back to the town via sled. there are a couple of closeups of the dead men. the one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth. all you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands. his hands are holding a flickering candle. the wind is blowing and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind, in tune with the flicker of the candle flame. the contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. the moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body.<br /><br />every time i revisit this film i see something new.
