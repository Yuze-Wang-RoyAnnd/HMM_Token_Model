i love this film (dont know why it is called pot luck in england - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name!), i spent 8 months in barcelona, not as an erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. it brings back so many great memories of the fun i had with all the friends i made from different countries, and of the city itself. i really want to see the followup 'les poupees russes ' (the russian dolls), i'm guessing it wont be released here? my brother saw it in france and said it def wasn't as good, but had a lot of the same cast (the brother of wendy gets married apparently). anyone know anything about this film? and whether it may be released?
