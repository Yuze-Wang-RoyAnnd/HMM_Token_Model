ok, the show was a little uneven, but i still loved it. i found the main two bunnies annoying, but hamton & plucky were always amusing.<br /><br />i really want the baby plucky episodes on dvd (or even vhs). please release those!<br /><br />specifically the "potty years" episode aired on 11/22/91; the "going up" episode aired on 9/17/92 and the "minister golf" episode in 11/92.<br /><br />they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bits!<br /><br />(i have nothing more to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and rewards us for brevity!)
