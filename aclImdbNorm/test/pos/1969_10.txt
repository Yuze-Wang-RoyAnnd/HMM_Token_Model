this was a movie i came across by accident. i was flipping through and saw it was on showtime so i watched it. now i watch it at least once a month. this is a movie that is filled with symbols that might cause some people to trash it. don't listen to people that hate this movie, if they want an action movie with expensive f/x they should have rented a movie that promises them. if you are in the mood for a good sci-fi, i highly recommend. if purchasing on dvd i recommend the alliance atlantic edition of the film, it contains many more extras than the dimension films edition.
