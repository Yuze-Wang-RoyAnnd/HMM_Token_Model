winning 26 out of the 28 awards it was nominated for, there is no doubt that this film will stand as one of the best of 2007. the fact that it was made with non professionals who were trained to act and dance makes it that much more special.<br /><br />it is not a bollywood production, but it is about art. a lower caste girl wants to sing and dance. she wants to move up in society, but there is a limit. everyone cannot be president in india, there is a caste system, and the narrow minds will not allow it to be breached.<br /><br />vanaja (mamatha bhukya) quits school at 15 and goes to work for the landlady (urmila dammannagari), who was once an accomplished dancer. after some time working the animals, she is taught to sing and dance. the film is strikingly beautiful with rich color. it is amazing what can be done with $20,000, as this film was a master's project for the writer director.<br /><br />the landlady's son (karan singh) returns from america to run for office and is struck by the girl. but, she is lower caste and can only be a vessel for his lust. things are no better at home as her father drinks and eats and steals her money. she ends up pregnant and has to sell the baby to the landlady.<br /><br />in the end, she never rises above her caste, but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good.
