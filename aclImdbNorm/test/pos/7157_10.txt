forgiving the franklins is the best film i have seen in years. the acting was fantastic..especially mari blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of peggy lester. she brought peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own next-door neighbor. i also enjoyed robertson dean in the role of the father... he is a true professional, and managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. the performances by the entire cast were very good, excellent, in fact but peggy's role as played by blackwell made the movie. the cinematography was beautifully done throughout and was most impressive. the only criticism i have to offer is a slight weakness of the ending scenes, which were overly drawn out, repetitive and a bit too focused on the wrong character. i would have liked to see it end on a note of forgiveness....but spite of that slight flaw, it is very much worth the watching and applause for all involved in the making of it.
