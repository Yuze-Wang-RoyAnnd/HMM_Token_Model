this was a very strong look at prejudice and group mentality. the cast is composed of superb actors doing a remarkable job. the sets are beautiful and just a bit stylized. the art direction is top notch along with great cinematography. the story is taut and shows how prejudice and bigotry can flourish easily. it is disturbing for its realistic violence and protrayal of a fairly typical community. i was very impressed.
