"in love and war" is a simple feel-good tv-film, and should be viewed as such.<br /><br />(possible spoiler)<br /><br />it is the story of a wwii british soldier, newby, captured with his commando by the italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. as the italians surrender to the allies, the commando is freed, and attempts to flee. however, the germans arrive and the commando is captured again. only newby, injured, remains at large. the rest of the film recounts how he is hidden and protected by the partisans, and his survival.<br /><br />(end of spoiler)<br /><br />based on a true story, "in love and war" is a refreshingly straightforward film. half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. the 'atmosfera' is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately unorganized or romantic italians, the serious stern-looking germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic british), although unoriginal, are still humorous. nicola piovani's musical score also adds to the mediterranean flavour.<br /><br />although it is far from being a "tea with mussolini" or a "la vita e bella", "in love and war" is a sweet simple film that will put a smile, and maybe even a little tan, on your face.
