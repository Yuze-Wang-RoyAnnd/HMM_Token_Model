latter days for me was a very moving film, it showed just how hard and disrespected the gay community really is. the film etherizes true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters, the film holds a real depth of compassion for the gay community, as it really speaks out for the gay man/woman. personally i think it's about high time that the homosexual community of all religions should no longer hold there head in shame, just for being there beautiful self. the film was very much of a eye opener for me as i could not believe how anti homosexual this world really is. even at schools if a kid dislikes something they will refer to it as being "gay". i real hope that more film like this one are made, and that they are not just labelled as a "gay" film but as a love story, as i believe that gay directors should stick up for themselves and tell their story through their eyes.
