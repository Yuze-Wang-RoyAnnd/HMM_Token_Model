i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action. 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts (pickup artists themselves) comment on them, choosing the winner. their jokes are amusing, and some participators are really fun to watch. more so, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, lots of expert's comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field. actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men, who like women.<br /><br />ps/ pardon for my broken engrish.
