surprisingly effective british drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the "flowering" of one of them. an embittered, "spike"-type youth (mcavoy) with deuchennes md is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (robertson) with cerebral palsy. robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but mcavoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings. the two leads are terrific, especially robertson, who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to pull off this tricky role. he appears in almost every scene, and acts up an absolute storm. to anyone who doesn't know, they might think he really has cb. highly recommended.
