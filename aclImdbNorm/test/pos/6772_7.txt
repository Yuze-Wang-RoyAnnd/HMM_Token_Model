good lord... how this ended up in our dvd player i'll never know...my wife thought it was a new release she'd missed somehow...nevermind it's a couple of years old and in danish ( i think)... she kept looking for the english soundtrack...<br /><br />all in all...the film wasn't bad... good production values,better performances, and a clever story that doesn't get too far away from itself make for tidy, dark-humored fare from across the sea! the ending will make you chuckle...in fact, the whole film will. incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your while...without spoiling the plot, the film's title and dvd jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going!
