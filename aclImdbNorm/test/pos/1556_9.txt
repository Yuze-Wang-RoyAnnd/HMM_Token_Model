i gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10. if it had had just a teensy weensy bit more plot line i would have given it 10.<br /><br />nonetheless it is a highly interesting film.<br /><br />judith ivey, playing a likable old floozy, should have been given the oscar for her performance.<br /><br />emily grace (portraying alice), whom i had never seen before, also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body i think i've ever seen on film.<br /><br />in a beat to heck old car, alice has lit out from the n.e. for florida where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, i'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the film's), and high hopes of going to college, which she and her family can't really afford.<br /><br />she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone, and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it's discovered there's a hole in one of her tires.<br /><br />she is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named sandra and her husband, bill, an older couple who are traveling in an rv.<br /><br />they're going south, to florida, and take her under their wing, but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves? flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life.
