this film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history. the use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of strike (eisenstein's 1st film). take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending, to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually did happen! a highly intelligent monumental film, a must see for all film students!
