this as the first of the ma and pa kettle flicks. marjorie main (ma) steals the show in anything she does. funny to see ida moore as emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was always old; she was in "desk set" and "alfred hitchcock presents". their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that pa doesn't care for. love the painting gag. keep an eye out for tom... he starred in "nanny & the professor". unfortunately he died real young... oddly enough, his last role was on the series "death cruise". weird. directed by charles lamont, who not only directed several of the kettle films, he also did a bunch of the abbott and costello flicks, so he must have known a thing or two about comedy. fun story, plain, simple humor. even the release date was april fool's day, 1949. the story starts out by showing us what backward and country-folk they are (the neighbors are even native americans), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for them.
