we all seem to be in agreement. it was an excellent show and let die way before it's time. i've decided that if i really enjoy a show, it's often the kiss of death. i love the quirky, ensemble cast shows, and a great setting always helps. i really expected to see a lot of these stars in other television productions, but short of mariska hagartay who played fisher stephens crazy girlfriend, i've not seen many of them except in occasional cameo roles. what a shame.<br /><br />key west, northern exposure, gilmore girls, and veronica mars... all great shows, all sadly gone before their time.<br /><br />hear us, loud and clear, we want key west on dvd..... please.
