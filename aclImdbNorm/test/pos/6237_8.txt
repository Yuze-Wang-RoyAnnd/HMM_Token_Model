some films just fade away, but tourist trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite. though not completely original--it owes much to the texas chainsaw massacre, it holds its own with a sense of humor, genuine creepy moments, a brilliant score by pino donaggio, and the fun performances by chuck connors and the cast. don't let the pg rating keep you away, this film proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining. those elements are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a film. here, the scares are merited and effective. plus, only chuck connors could carry a scene in which he has to share soup with a mannequin! a classic scene indeed. now more accessible on dvd in widescreen, this film is a must for fans of '70s horror fare.
