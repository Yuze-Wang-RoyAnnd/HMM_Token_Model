i was disappointed with the recent (2000) american remake of this english mini-series. though it followed the plot line very closely, it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original out. not to mention adding shallow preachy heavy-handed 'messages'... so my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick with the original. it's much longer, but gripping and totally well done. interesting, complex and textured, without the preachy self-righteousness... and it's beautifully shot, as well.<br /><br />i find it galling that these heartless remakes of great overseas films get so much hollywood fanfare at the oscars. (though i did like benicio del torro getting some deserved praise...)
