this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. that would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. the theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. as with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. alas, we probably will never know.
