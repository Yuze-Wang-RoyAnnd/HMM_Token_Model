with some wine, some friends and some good humor, i had a really good time watching this film. i particularly enjoyed the performance of jilon ghai (as "randy"), who was such a kick in the pants! his scenes with charity rahmer ("michelle") were wildly amusing. i wouldn't want him coming on to me, but it was great watching "randy" try to score with "michelle" and even better seeing the results! of course, the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too. and, a friend of mine showed me the playboy issue that had pilar lastra as the playmate of the month. she's definitely a looker. all in all, this film totally served its purpose, which was to entertain us in a light and care-free way.
