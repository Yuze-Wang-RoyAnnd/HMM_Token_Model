i loved this. it starts out as a fairly normal, slightly ponderous french art movie and then all of a sudden, halfway through it's turned on it's head. this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one. sadly, the ending doesn't make much sense, which is a great shame. oh yes, and it's brilliantly filmed.
