this is a film by oshima, the director of the notorious "in the realm of the senses", a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while. this film takes place initially in 1895 in japan and stars the very pretty keziko yoshiyuki as seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind. that man, toyoji, comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her, though she soon is rather willing to be seduced. soon they are having an affair and plot to kill seki's husband, to be together forever. they do, and throw him down a well. however, they didn't count on the ghost of the dead husband haunting seki and others in the village! this film is visually very stunning, the use of shadows highlighting this tale of murder for passion. ms. yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is especially very good in her role. its sexual at times, but not like "in the realm of the senses". some of what ensues is up to our imagination. i found this film to have a consistency of mood that makes it very watchable. a little creepy but that goes with the territory. i'd recommend this.
