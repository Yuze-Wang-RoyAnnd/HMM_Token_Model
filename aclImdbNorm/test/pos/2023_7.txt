so, you wanna be a rock star? see this movie. you don't like rock, you say? or you're really into heavy metal? then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. rarely have i ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this. i had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties, and i have played guitar for the last 15 years or so. did i like rock star? oh yes. the music is good, not great, the actors are good, and believable, even jennifer aniston plays her part to perfection. and mark wahlberg is perfect as the wannabe rock singer. so you know what you're going to get. a movie about dreams coming true, being stepped on, and finally figuring out what life is really about. it's a good solid seven out of ten, no more, no less.
