i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it, people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance. i really hope norton did not do this. he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie.<br /><br />i found it entertaining. it wasn't mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects, but it was not a bad. it was fun to watch. but yea, definitely not a bad/horrible movie.<br /><br />7/10
