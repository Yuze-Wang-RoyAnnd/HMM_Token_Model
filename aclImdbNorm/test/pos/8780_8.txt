there are many familiar hitchcock elements (of previous and later films) and this time they mix to a jolly, but hardly suspenseful piece of entertainment. you can tell that dorothy parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people. the famous climax on the statue of liberty seems a bit heavy-handed - judged by today's standards, but also compared to other hitch monument finals (e.g. blackmail, north by northwest).
