after watching the movie a few times, i found so many subtle touches and emotions within the dialogue. jing ke, the assassin has become one of favorite movie characters of all time. this fine chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements then any big screen american actor today. qin, the emperor, is brilliant as he leads the audience to believe the kindness in his heart, only to unleash the most cruel acts upon the people around him. the promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil fist. gong li, as in just about every movie i've ever seen her in, is simply fantastic. her screen dominance is so graceful and emotionally charged.<br /><br />in case you couldn't tell, i loved this movie.<br /><br />
