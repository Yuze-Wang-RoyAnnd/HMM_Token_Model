i am still waiting for years a new dvd issue of this marvelous film. i own a beta max recording with french language. unfortunately, mgm omits the french track on his recent dvd... just english spoken an french subtitles...i don't know how make mgm to be advised: i wrote emails to them but, of course, no answer. if i insist, it's because exceptionally, the dubbing track in french was spectacular, funny, well written etc... george c. scott acting is always outstanding and, for people born like me during the 50ies, diana rigg represents something very different than madonna (for example). thanks for help... kind regards...
