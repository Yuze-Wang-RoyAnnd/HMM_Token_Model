shtrafbat - penal battalion is a moving, and mostly honest, look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two. one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed "band of brothers" miniseries.<br /><br />formed in july of 1942 on the eve of battle of stalingrad, the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties (sometimes as high as 90%). prisoners of gulag (political prison/concentration camps), deserters, soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape, soldiers accused of breaching protocol, were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not "traitors of the motherland" with their lives. those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the law.<br /><br />this miniseries features a look at one such shtrafbat, under the command of tverdokhlebov - an honorable officer who was captured by the germans, was shot and left for dead. it features a colorful and varied group of people, thrust into a situation from which there is no escape. the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip "kulak" (the fist) and his little gang of unreformed criminals, a young jewish intellectual who struck his anti-semite officer, father (orthodox priest) mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the house-to-house fighting, political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country, must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living, and to keep on fighting.<br /><br />although set during a war, not every episode features combat, in fact what combat scenes there are, are often chaotic, sporadic, and short - which was probably the intent of the director. in between, the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast, their backgrounds, their thoughts and tragedies. the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbat's soldier and then his execution, execution for supposed awol, periods of boredom on the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a german bunker stocked with food (and champagne), the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors, cheating on a spouse, and other situations, feature prominently. the camera is unflinching - it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearing.<br /><br />the acting is superb and deep, and the script is likewise well written. everything from rage, to weariness, to resignation, to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to, is rendered almost faultlessly. one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture. because it is a history drama in a sense, some of the terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost on some viewers. this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat, but these references are a nice touch of authenticity. another complain that could be levied, is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot, but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps.
