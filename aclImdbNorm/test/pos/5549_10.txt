this movie just felt very true to life. i liked the ending which seemed to resolve naturally without any big moments but with a lot of little moments coming together. you could tell it is an honest love story. it doesn't matter what the 'sexual orientation' of the main characters are, it still a story about love and understanding.<br /><br />there were a lot of scenes that involved the family. the setting is during what for some people is a very stressful time. namely "the holidays." christmas to be precise. <br /><br />like most good films, this one addresses issues of love, fitting in, expectations, and can't-be-overcome biases. in the end alexandra and casey make a choice for each other, knowing that love is difficult, and about giving. well done.
