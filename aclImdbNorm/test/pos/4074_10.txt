i don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. the thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. this is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. the three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former tv cop, brought in by russo's character to coach the cops on how to be "tv cops." those are by far the funniest scenes. if you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh, then watch this movie.
