those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow 'belongs' to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else. fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - though if we are fortunate only on their death.<br /><br />this film is true in setting, atmosphere and dialogue to nigel balchin's original novel ('a way through the wood'), and by pinpointing a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the depiction of english upper class country life is very accurate).<br /><br />i loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an uk-compatible dvd
