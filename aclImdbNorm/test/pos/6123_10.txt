i grew up in baltimore, so i was exposed to the films of john waters, since i was way too young to watch them. and if you're knowledge of john waters is limited to hairspray or cry-baby, or other family friendly movies, then you must prepare yourself for pink flamingos.<br /><br />explicit sex acts, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unsanitary acts with chickens are just a mere portion of some of the depravity in this movie. the film ends with divine, waters' 300 lbs. cross-dressing star eating dog excrement.<br /><br />the premise is about two families: one a pair of inbred trailer trash, which includes divine and edith massey as the egg lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. both families are competing for the title of "filthiest person alive." enjoy john waters' finest movie, but only see it if you're an open-minded individual with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this movie will gross you out.
