one of quite a few cartoon scooby doo films, "scooby doo and the loch ness monster" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the highlands of scotland. one annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - american people trying to sound scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better scottish accents than others).<br /><br />daphne has come to the highlands to see her cousin shannon and the highland games at blake castle. gravely shannon tells the gang that she believes to have seen the loch ness monster. when yet more chaos arises, the mystery inc gang have another mystery on their hands...<br /><br />good for scooby doo fans and for people who want to find out more about scotland! enjoy "scooby doo and the loch ness monster"! :-)
