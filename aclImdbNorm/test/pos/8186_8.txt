leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers i must say that it seemed to me a film about power,which is in my opinion one of the most luring illusions. i saw the drama of an emperor and people. it seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of "happiness" for all is. is there justification for the enforced benefit and "happiness"? how much can be forfeited for the nation's security and peaceful existence? is the idea of a powerful would-be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now? it seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. he is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. he seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. no wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. it seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success.
