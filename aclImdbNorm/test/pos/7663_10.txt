i can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully. i know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film, and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten, late '20s style but 1932 movie, which should probably be referred to as "indecent," as that is the name on the main titles.<br /><br />myrna loy, best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles, shows herself to be miscast in all of them. she was a true dramatic actress, something that i did not know before watching this film, which predates all of her famous roles. she is exciting and moving here, two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined william powell. i'm still rather in shock over how good she was.<br /><br />becky sharp (1935), the first three-strip technicolor feature, is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation. it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die. you cannot take my word for it, you must see it.
