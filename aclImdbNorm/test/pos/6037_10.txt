alex benedict (john cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist. when she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn't leave his wife, he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide. too bad for him our rumpled detective, lt. columbo (peter falk), is on the case.<br /><br />stephen bochco has written another razor-sharp episode for the series, following marvelous detail with marvelous detail. we watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we're completely engrossed. then when columbo appears on the scene, it gets even better.<br /><br />we first see columbo after the murder (as per usual). this time he's at the vet with his new dog. scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show (think columbo's discomfort over the nude model in "suitable for framing"). columbo is hilarious when he's dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry; but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with non-suspects. bochco, by contrast, shows columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. (and i'm grateful he didn't strain for a punchline to columbo's quest to give the dog a name. as far as we learn, the dog remains nameless.) bochco gives columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and peter falk makes the most of them. he's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself, much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. and he's even better in his scenes playing cat-and-mouse with cassavetes. that these two long-time friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected; and that's what we get. notice how alex benedict can't help but admire the deceptively dimwitted columbo, even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck.<br /><br />bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. when columbo goes to question benedict's snooty mechanic, of course
