scratch is a documentary about djs and their art of scratching. from that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is. it is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known. it's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top djs (e.g. dj q-bert, dj shadow, and mix master mike from the beastie boys) showing off their stuff. going into the film i wasn't sure that "scratching" can really be called an art form, or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right. scratch completely changed my mind on these points. what these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing--it is definitely some kind of art--and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument that you can "play," as much as a drum or a guitar. and you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from dj q-bert (e.g. how to use the fader to get different sound effects). all these djs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching herbie hancock perform his song "rock it" (you remember that song, don't you?) live at the grammys. what got their attention was not hancock himself but his dj and his scratching. not only is scratch about scratching, but it does some "scratching" of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. there are moments where clips are quickly "rewound" and then "forwarded" several times, which mirrors (in the film medium) what happens when a dj quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that "wicka-wicka-wicka" sound). whether you're a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies. after seeing it, i had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own. and i mean this as a compliment.
