i enjoyed this film very much. i found it to be very entertaining for me in that i feel that it captured the romanticism of turn of the century irish-american culture. there's no messages. there's no violence and there's no overt sex, just wholesome 1947 style entertainment and dennis morgan had a chance to sing some really good songs. a really good movie.
