father hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling father who is definitely a hood! patrick swayze plays jack charles who is a hood always on the look-out for the one big "score" that is going to put him on easy street. his wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care. when he "got out" he thought they were probably better off in foster care
