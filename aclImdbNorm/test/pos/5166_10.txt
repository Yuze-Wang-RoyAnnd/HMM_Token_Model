this is an excellent movie and i wish that they would put it out on dvd for people to purchase. it is difficult to try to catch it on tv all the time. as you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it. can someone tell me what file company make it so i can write to them and see if they will release it to the public? i only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and i only got to see it once last year. my sisters and i are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos. john denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great. they put out some much older movies and i think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and i think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests we might get some of them put out on dvd.
