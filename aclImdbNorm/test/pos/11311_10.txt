julie brown hilariously demolishes madonna's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival madonna's own. cinematography and sets are top notch.<br /><br />kathy griffin and chris elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film. appearances by bobcat goldthwait and wink martindale, as themselves, is an added bonus.<br /><br />it's hard to tell if brown's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease madonna, though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in it.<br /><br />my favorite line: "why don't you come here (to the phillipines); all they eat is dog and i'm a vegetarian."
