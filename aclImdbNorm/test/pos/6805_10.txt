this is the first movie i ever owned on video, and 14 years later, i still have the same copy. elizabeth taylor was as radiant at twelve as ever later in life, mickey rooney gave real dimension to mi taylor, and donald crisp was solid as ever as mr. brown. the amazing anne revere, as mrs. brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. after nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor, and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, root for the pie, and love velvet for the spirit and capacity for love that she displays. i love it as an adult just as i loved it as a child. a must for every family video collection.
