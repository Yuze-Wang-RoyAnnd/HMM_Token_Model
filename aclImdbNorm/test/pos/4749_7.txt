how did they get that cinematic shot of the car colliding with the back end of the semi? and then roy sits up -- great! looks like the dvd is scheduled for may of 2006 - about time!! watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio. my other favorites in this category are: original italian job with michael caine; bullit with steve mcqueen; to live and die in la with the csi guy when he was young; french connection with gene hackman; ronin with robert deniro; vanishing point with barry newman; enemy of the state with hackman again -- what are your favorites?
