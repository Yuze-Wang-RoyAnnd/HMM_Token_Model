this movie is sweet - not cloying, just warm-spirited and kind. i found it only mildly funny, and the premise *is* wildly improbable, but the characters are so charming (especially minnie driver's) that they had my full attention right from the beginning, and soon had my affection too.<br /><br />bonnie hunt has done a great job in her directing debut, and a good job with the writing as well. i highly recommend this movie and will see it again, i'm sure.
