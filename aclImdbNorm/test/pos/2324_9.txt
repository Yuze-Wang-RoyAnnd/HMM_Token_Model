i just discovered this film and love it. just the right mix of fast moving story, entertaining characters, hilarious moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes), and fun performances by kelsey grammar, harry dean stanton, ron schneider, rip torn and more. buckman is especially good, and i really enjoyed watching the guy who played stapanick.<br /><br />i also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the pampanito, for the running on top scenes and emulated it almost exactly for their sets. the set decoration is really impressive if you do a digital tour of the pampanito online and then compare it to scenes in the movie. they did an excellent job on this film.<br /><br />what a light entertaining and truly enjoyable movie!
