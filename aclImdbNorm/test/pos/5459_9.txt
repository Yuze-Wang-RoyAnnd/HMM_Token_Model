the late shift is a great book, i read the book several years ago, and i was transfixed at the cutthroat debauchery that went on when johnny carson retired and jay leno and johnny carson tried to grab his spot. when the movie came out, i snagged a vhs copy of the movie, and having reread the book recently, it's hard to say which i enjoy more, because they're quite equal in the amount of information conveyed. the two lead actors, john michael higgins, and daniel roebuck, two actors i never heard of before, and haven't heard of since, play leno and letterman convincingly, despite letterman's dismissal of his portrayal as being poor. they play the parts quite well, despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two. i wasn't as interested in that. the story is what counts. and that brings me to kathy bates. kathy bates, playing helen kushnick, is this movie. she plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself, much less a national tv show. yikes! there should be a sequel!!
