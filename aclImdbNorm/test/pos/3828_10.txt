i just thought i would add another observation, here. while there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between jim kirk and yeoman janice rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. when the enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal romulan plasma ball, janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer. i thought it was sweet (and janice, of course, is gorgeous!).<br /><br />(p.s. goof:- several times, while supposedly firing phasors, the film shows photon torpedoes being launched)
