travis and sandy(ben johnson and harry carey, jr.)are horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement. what they do not expect is to encounter the notorious clegg murderers, with their wounded leader uncle shiloh(charles kemper). ward bond portrays elder wiggs, the main voice for the mormon group moving the wagon train to the lord's destination. along the way, they also encounter "doctor" a locksley hall and his "hoochey koochey wagon" and lend them help.<br /><br />lovingly directed by ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail. the film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see, if just not for a change of pace. young johnson and carey, jr. come off real well, but this is bond's film to shine as he has the best lines. johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like shiloh and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the clegg boys ride along side them a piece.<br /><br />i'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.
