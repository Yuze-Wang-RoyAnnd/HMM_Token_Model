strangeland seems to have a love/hate relationship with many of its viewers. i personally loved the movie, and everything about it.<br /><br />the acting in some places could be improved upon, but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can't. in some areas, the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic, but really, what do you expect from the late 90s? over all, dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i've ever seen. it plays on the fears of many age groups--adult, parents, and children. every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet. and it *does* happen in the real world. and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will; that happens too in the real world. which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many.<br /><br />my only warning is if you *know* you are sensitive to things such as strong violence, visible torture, and gore, then you do *not* want to see this movie. if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you, then read as many reviews as you can, ask people you know who have seen this movie, and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed.
