i love dogs, and the most interesting character in this movie is a golden retriever. he is smarter, better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters. like many other contributors i have not read the book but i doubt that having done so would change my opinion of the movie. it is predictable from the first five minutes on. no surprises. mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teen age boy and his wonder dog collaborate to destroy it. all in all the movie is a dog. but as i said, i love dogs and will therefore give this movie a 7/10 rating. watch it if it comes on tv, rent it if you are bored and nothing else catches your eye, but don't buy it unless it is on special.
