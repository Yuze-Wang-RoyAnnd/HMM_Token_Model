this movie is excellent ( i watched the french version ). there are many subplots (which usually detracts from the whole ), but they nicely unfold and concur to the "discovering of one's real self" main theme. in fact, the whole movie (besides his background ) is the journey to the discovery of one's ( or someone else's ) self. is the king really a "good peacenik monarch" trying to wage a "war to end all wars" or is he just a disturbed, blood thirsty hoodlum? is he a true king, after all? is the attendant to the queen mother just a lusty, career-driven, spineless sock puppet or rather a sharp thinking, bold individual? will the dame/concubine realize who the king truly is? what's between the king and the old chancellor? what's the secret everyone knows but won't tell? what's the true reason the assassin quit his "job"? subplots (something i'm not particularly fond of ) are handled well and keep one watching until the end. scenes are well crafted and cgi fits nicely in, without going overboard. suspense is properly maintained and actors are upto the task. there is a lot of brain-damaged smiling, but that is how one was supposed to behave at the king's court ( as the dame/concubine complains about ). realistic movie without superhero moments. this chinese movie really puts hollywood cardboard colossals ( gladiator etc ) to shame.
