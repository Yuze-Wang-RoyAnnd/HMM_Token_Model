i think this movie is underrated. to me it felt like a gulp of fresh air. some people complain about the implausibility of the plot, overlong sequences and lack of sex (the latter being, i believe, the main reason for "implausibility"; and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty?!); but it's just not their thing, and good for them if they can't relate to the story. the performances are great; i'd really like to see more of the actors in other movies. the emotions are genuine. the whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety. and it does give you the tingly feeling you expect to get from a good movie.
