it is clear this film's value far supersedes the cost with which the format (mini-dv) implies. in fact, the filmmaker embraces the format and incorporates it so craftily into the storyline that i forgot the fact that i was not seeing the typical 35 millimeter film. it has the core appeal of indie movies like clerks & the work of robert rodriguez combined with a fantastic "new take" on the romantic comedy genre. "this is not a film" is an honest film with honest portrayals and, it is a superbly paced narrative. there is not one point in this film where i felt a scene could have (or should have) been omitted. on the contrary, the director pulls amazing performances out of truly gifted actors and does so in extremely confining circumstances. from page to screen, this film is a worthy and relevant story that hits on so many levels (creative, technical or otherwise). i highly recommend it for all who enjoy cinema or those looking for a little charm in an otherwise devoid of charm medium.
