i hope we never become to cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie: beautiful to look at with its romantic english countryside, and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. watch this with your children, especially your young daughters- velvet brown is a wonderful role model for girls. this was one of my daughter's favorite films.<br /><br />the story is based on a best selling book by enid bagnold about a girl, velvet, whose whole life is her horse, pi, and about her single-minded pursuit of her "impossible" dream. i won't say anymore about the plot less i spoil it for first-time viewers. she lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village.<br /><br />this is the movie that made elizabeth taylor a star, and to watch the film is to understand why. she is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her outward beauty- trusting, passionate, innocent- she is the emotional core of the movie.<br /><br />mickey rooney gives a wonderful performance as mi, the young man who arrives on their doorstep one day, stays, and helps velvet train the pi. this is one of his finest performances. also standing out is anne revere as velvet's mother in an academy award winning role. her strong, loving and wise character understands that life isn't of much value unless you follow your dreams: "we're alike. i, too, believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly once in his life." <br /><br />i heartily recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from hollywood's golden age.
