this is another of robert altman's underrated films(let's be honest, the only movie he's made that really didn't work was ready to wear), and sandy dennis gives a spellbinding performance in it.she is far better here than she was in "the out of towners". the material, i will admit, is beneath the great director altman and the extraordinary actress dennis, but that hardly matters anyway.as long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well, just about any story will do.
