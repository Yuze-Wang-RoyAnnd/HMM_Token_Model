someone says this anime could be offensive for girls... not really. embarrassing situations are funny; first time i see this series i was in the video store, people around me started laughing, doesn't matter the age or gender. a teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page. during the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car, during the last moments of the series, the same car appears.. episodes had a touching and funny ending, specially last one. i don't regret to buy these series.
