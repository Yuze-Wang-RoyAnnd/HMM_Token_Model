i thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion. i agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. i think that this is what what made the film good. it didn't villainies either mr. or mrs. kramer and it was refreshing, i think, to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for billy. and, although it was a little strange, i actually liked the music in this film as well. for some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon. this movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle, like some emotionally heavy films tend to do. it dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously. it simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well.
