i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax. as we all know, betamax went the way of the 8-trak tape, sigh, it really had nice picture quality too. anyways, i'm glad i found this movie again, i've been searching for it for more than 10 years! this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane: continuous jokes, oneliners, funny actions (bodylanguage). mark blankfield is absolutely hilarious. his transformation from the shy dr. daniel jekyll into the sex-crazed partyanimal mr. hyde is unforgettable, complete with goldtooth, chesthair and goldchains. the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woo's. totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it. when i first seen it, i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing. this is a movie i could watch over and over again. i highly recommend it.
