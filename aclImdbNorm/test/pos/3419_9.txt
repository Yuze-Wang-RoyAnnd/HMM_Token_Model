where this movies differs from traditional hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. in europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict. in the us, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the us citizen never had to live with its enemy. this explains in my view the often simplistic nature of hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife. but in this movie, the director and screenplay did not fall into this clich'e. it turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong. it's a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.
