my wife and i saw this when we were 17. the only good thing my father ever did (get us in). this is "our movie" and the music is "our songs". michelle's song is "our" song. yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? the movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. she is left alone with child. it is a love story and a "growing up" story. the music is fantastic, and the story is one any person could relate to. may be someday this will be released on dvd.
