if you wish to see shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, i suggest you find this bbc version. indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but jacoby's performance as hamlet and patrick stewart's as claudius are well worth the effort.<br /><br />it never ceases to amaze me how clear "hamlet" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard. every film version of "hamlet" has tinkered with its structure. olivier concentrated on hamlet's indecision, gibson on his passions. jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlet's character together with the aid of shakespeare's full script.<br /><br />why does hamlet not kill claudius immediately? hamlet says "i am very proud, revengeful, ambitious..." hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father's death (and suspected murder), or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet. he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself. he is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. and this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance. he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so. he must "out" the king's secret and here is the tragedy! at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying claudius' guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. why? he wants it all! he wants revenge, the throne and the damnation of claudius' soul in hell. hamlet overreaches himself in classic tragic form. his own hubris is his undoing. he kills polonius thinking it is claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of rosencrantz, guildenstern, ophelia, laertes, gertrude, claudius and hamlet himself.
