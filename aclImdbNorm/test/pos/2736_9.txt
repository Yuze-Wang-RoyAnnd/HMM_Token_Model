if you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (mithi). the movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. aparna sen delivers yet another masterpiece. each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. konkona sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. she pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. shabana azmi is incredible as usual. she plays the dominating and fiercely independent elder sister of mithi who takes care of her ailing sister and aging mother. she refuses to accept that in-spite of all her strength and courage, she still feels lonely at times. this should have been a very easy movie for rahul bose. the role was least bit demanding and anyone could have done the role.<br /><br />the ending of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park avenue experience. it took me a while to digest that the movie had ended. it left me confused and maybe even a bit disturbed. but later on, it started sinking in. my eyes are black. but if everyone says they are blue, will i still believe that its black??!
