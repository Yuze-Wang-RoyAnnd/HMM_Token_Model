i thought this movie was highly underrated. the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange, and i was put off at first, but once i was watching the movie, it didn't seem strange at all. i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer, and i couldn't wait to find out how it would end. once it did end....i thought about it for a long time after. i was pleased with everything about k-pax, from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues, to the ending. it's not an especially upbeat or happy film, though it does make you chuckle from time to time, but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought-provoking. i own it now, and intend to watch it many times.
