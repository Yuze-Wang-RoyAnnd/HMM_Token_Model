we just saw this movie in austin texas at the alamo south lamar yesterday afternoon. it had me laughing out loud many times! the scene about albert einstein's thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and i couldn't stop laughing. it's too bad it's not in more theaters, i know a lot of friends that are dieing to see this movie! "welcome to costco, i love you." ... great work to all involved! also, if you see it, make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well! i'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! if you're a fan of office space and beavis and butthead then you have to go see this movie. it's a classic and no one knows that it's out! so if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend, definitely check it out.
