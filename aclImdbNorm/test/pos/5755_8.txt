this is a gem of a film, slapstick violence a-plenty, simon pegg and green spew.<br /><br />a suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker. <br /><br />if you haven't seen this i can highly recommend it, maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short.<br /><br />if you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film.<br /><br />i didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts.<br /><br />feeb - 1 boiled egg.
