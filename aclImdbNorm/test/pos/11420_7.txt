critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie, but i actually didn't think it was too bad! even the critics i normally agree with thought it was crap, and i normally despise pg-13 "horror films." so this means one of two things: either (1) i'm too easily pleased, and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years, or (2) 'when a stranger calls' isn't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be. now, to be fair, some of the criticisms of the movie are true--there's not much character development, and not much happens in the story. but man alive folks, how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked? cut them some slack! as a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out, i can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo! who knows? i guess stuff like this just gives me the willies.<br /><br />yes, i admit i had fun watching this, and i don't care how big of a minority that puts me in. ;)
