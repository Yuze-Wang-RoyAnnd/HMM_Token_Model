the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo, regardless of the age of the oav. the plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.<br /><br />this might sound picky, but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would you feel comfortable there as a human? would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? i doubt it. there are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters. seems sloppy to me.<br /><br />the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement, though no light is shed on this. little light is shed on the backstory at all, a great pity. the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we don't see any character depth. the groundwork's all down, yet we're left with no finished product. a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode, once some character sub-plots had been established.<br /><br />the highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the action/espionage.<br /><br />the flaws really start to show through once you've had a chance to digest all the goings-on, so i couldn't recommend this for owning, but it's certainly worth a watch or two! whilst this review is mostly negative, i really do think it's worth your time to watch this, but it's not something to rush out and buy. <br /><br />in a nutshell: a watchable wasted opportunity.
