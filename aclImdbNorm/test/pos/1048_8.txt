this film reminds me very much of the later rock hudson film man's favorite sport--about a fishing writer who has never fished and is forced into entering a fishing tournament. in this case, barbara stanwyck is a martha stewart-like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles--in fact, she has no family at all. well, like rock, she is maneuvered into performing--in this case, creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside. since there is no family, she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately not to "let the cat out of the bag" that she can't do any of the things she is known for doing. a cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup.
