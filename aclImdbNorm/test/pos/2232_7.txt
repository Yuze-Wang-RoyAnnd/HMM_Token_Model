i tivo'd this on turner classic just because it was pre-code and sounded interesting. when i got around to watching, i noticed that the "critique" gave it one and a half stars on a four-star scale. i started watching with trepidation -- even old movies can be bad movies -- but i quickly got engaged in the story and mary astor's performance as the business brains behind a simple salesman's rise to success. not a truly great movie -- too predictable -- but certainly better than advertised. and i would have liked to have seen more of ricardo cortez as the man who appreciates mary but won't give up his wealthy wife. i'd recommend giving it a look just to appreciate astor and what a long way we've come, baby.
