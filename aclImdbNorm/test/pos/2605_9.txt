i must admit that this is one of the few lou costello films that i actually saw in the theater. most have now been seen on t.v. and i must admit that lou is really enjoyable and he gets the girl,too. this was my first time seeing dorothy provine perform and of course i fell in love with her like so many others that day. i have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one. her performance in the great race is one of the reasons i bought the disc in the first place!<br /><br />every comment on this movie tells that this is the one movie that lou costello did with out bud abbott,which is true,but if lou had lived he would have made many more. he really does a good job and doesn't have to rely on his old routines to get laughs. i for one am sorry that the little man from patterson,n.j. didn't get the chance to do that.<br /><br />i hope this comes out on dvd some time so i can add it to my comedy/sci fi collection.
