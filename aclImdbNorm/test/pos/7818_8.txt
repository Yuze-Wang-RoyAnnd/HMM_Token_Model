a charming movie enhanced by the musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. my understanding is that there was never a soundtrack but could you, through your sources, advise me where i might get information on the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. your help would be appreciated. the song really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy wherever possible so that we might play it as background music when we have our family and friends over for our "italian nights". if you are able to get this information to us we would be eternally grateful. even if you can advise of the studio contact so that we might go direct.<br /><br />regards,<br /><br />john payling
