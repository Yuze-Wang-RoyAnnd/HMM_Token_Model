no movie could ever do justice to faulkner's command of the english language. but they did a pretty good job here. lucas beauchamp is exactly the way i pictured him in the book, as is chick. what the movie couldn't really go into was how beauchamp wasn't liked by the negro people either, because he was equally as stubborn. not that it is a bad thing, but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world (yet, i got the feeling it was white society's racism that started it and it spilled over into negro society, until that became his attitude toward everyone).<br /><br />the best part of the movie is that you get to see yoknapatawpha county (actually, oxford, mississippi) exactly as faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when faulkner was alive and writing). it doesn't look that much different today. because of this alone, the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in faulkner's backyard. a true must see for faulkner fans.
