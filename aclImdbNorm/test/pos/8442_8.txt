it was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release. fonda, douglas and lemmon were known "lefties", but the accident at three mle island provided shocking context to this fictional drama.<br /><br />this film works on many levels, taking shots at both public utilities and tv news. 1979 was the zenith of the infamous "happy talk" format of tv news (see also "ron burgundy") and it's on display here in all its glory. the sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a "grinding head-on collision" before cheerfully introducing kimberley wells (fonda), doing a story about a veterinarian who makes house (or is that "aquarium?") calls. the show's producer and the station manager argue about content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes.<br /><br />there are a few technical errors. the pr flack (james hampton) shows fonda and douglas the requisite scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant, built by westinghouse. later, as lemmon and wilford brimley (nicely playing lemmon's friend/colleague, caught between duty and loyalty) fight a sudden crisis in the plant' s control room, they're obviously running a boiling-water plant (built by ge.) a small point, but curious, considering how many details the screenwriters got right.<br /><br />like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers. the real-world accident at tmi proves the film's basic premise. the working title for the film was originally "power", and you'll see why. as nuclear power prepares to make a comeback in these days of $3 gas, "the china syndrome" is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago.
