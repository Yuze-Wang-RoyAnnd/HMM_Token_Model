hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business, who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can't get out of until the dastardly plot that's behind their troubles is resolved. that way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. we certainly do in this fine film. barry kane is only trying to help his fellow-man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration, like helping fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory. barry even returns a lost $100 bill to fry later on...that was big money in 1943!! it's barry's acts of christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon, he's wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he can't clear himself. similar to the 39 steps in plot, the hero travels cross-country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells, an arch-villain who nobody could believe to be a closet-nazi, and a beautiful blonde, patricia martin, who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with barry kane. hitch's trademark touches of humor are here, too. patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys, all the way from las vegas to nyc. we meet a trucker who's a one-man comedy act "someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day." field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the "suits" just as if they were working for some legit enterprise. during a chase scene into a cinema, audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy/gangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing movie-patron. awful for the dead old man, but funny! hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance, with the statue of liberty as backdrop and ironic icon! it works even better than the mt rushmore scene in nbnw.
