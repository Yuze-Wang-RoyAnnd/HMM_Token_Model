crossfire is one of those films from the forties that is crying for a remake, if for no other reason than maybe it's time it should be done as originally written. the story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man. but anti-semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days of post world war ii with the holocaust fresh in everyone's mind.<br /><br />in the lee server biography of robert mitchum, edward dmytryk the director was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with the code firmly in place. it could have been though because the character of robert ryan is such an equal opportunity hater of everything that deviates from his societal norms.<br /><br />mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride. robert young was cast as the washington, dc police homicide captain who catches the case and while mitchum was second billed, he knew from the beginning the film would belong to ryan. but he was rko's new star by dint of his performances in the story of gi joe and till the end of time so he was there for box office insurance. mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, george cooper.<br /><br />crossfire is not a whodunit, even though we don't see the crime it becomes clear that montgomery is the one who kills sam levene, the quintessential jewish salesperson. and it becomes clear to young and mitchum that ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience. it becomes just a question of getting the evidence.<br /><br />ryan earned one of several academy award nominations the film garnered, his best supporting actor category. though he lost to edmund gwenn, the film was ryan's breakthrough role. similarly gloria grahame was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for best supporting actress, but she lost to celeste holm for gentleman's agreement. in fact crossfire ran up against gentleman's agreement and lost for best picture and best director for dmytryk to elia kazan. it's fifth nomination for best screenplay and crossfire came up short again with the winner being miracle on 34th street.<br /><br />gloria grahame also had her own problems on the set which spilled over from her personal life. she was having big trouble with her then husband stanley clements who was an abusive husband. he was hanging around the set causing ed dmytryk a lot of problems. fortunately grahame's part was a small one. in fact the whole film was shot in typical rko economy style in 20 days.<br /><br />robert young has a particularly fine scene with william phipps a young kid from tennessee in mitchum and ryan's outfit who ryan constantly belittles. young is most eloquent in speaking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as irish catholics who came over in the potato famine years. it was one of robert young's best moments on screen in his long career.<br /><br />as fine a film as crossfire is, it's time to be remade as a story about an anti-gay hate crime. especially with the real killing of barry winchell from the last decade and the debate about gays in the military.<br /><br />that's a film who's time has come and almost gone.
