i just saw this movie on showtime in the wee hours of the night. i was viewing the beginning with one eye open, but instead of drifting off to sleep, i became invested in this crafty, nail-bitter of a movie. it was very believable and engaging. i could have done without so much profanity(as with every david mamet movie i see), but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. i know teenagers swear, but i don't need to listen to it. anyways, the story had some interesting surprises which i won't reveal but if you have a chance to catch this movie on showtime, i think you will enjoy it as much as i have.
