first of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically. some kind of combination between "american beauty" and "as good as it gets". and of course something specifically to all russian movies ( of course the valuable one, no dirty propaganda !) : the problem of loneliness of man ... especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all vomitive propaganda about communism ( both positive or negative propaganda ! ). a movie about common people, their problems, lack of satisfactions - especially for young ones, fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society ... and about the fake "solutions" : alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution : true love ... of course it's very well "located" in the space and time of "russian perestroika" but it's valid for all the society ( except a perfect one, but don't worry - not possible to find this on our earth !). for the last time - definitely recommended ...
