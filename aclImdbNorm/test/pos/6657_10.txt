i just saw the dvd and loved it. in particular, i thought the director and jude and nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between inman and ada just before inman left. it was the most romantic kiss i've ever seen in a film. i thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie; it managed to make it believable that inman and ada would walk/wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship. i thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. i'm sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one, but this one is it for me! jude and nicole had showed incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together.
