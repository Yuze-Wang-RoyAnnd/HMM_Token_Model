many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years. i was inclined to agree with this until the influx of asian horror films, a trend which has admittedly grown dull. however, it has produced some true classics, and a tale of two sisters, for me at least, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time.<br /><br />based vaguely on a korean folktale, it tells the sad story of two mentally-troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother. after experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home, they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. the tension rises and there is the inevitable snap. but what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the scares become more emotional and quite real. by the end, you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind, but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. one to watch again and again, if only to work it all out.
