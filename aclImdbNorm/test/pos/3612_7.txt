here's a well-made war story, nicely shot and well-acted. the portraying of the italian and german occupancy of greek island kefalonia is well-done. john hurt as pelagia's father and the island doctor is superb, nicolas cage does a good job as the captain from the title, penelope cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at cage. there's heroics and humor, there's drama and romance, and it is all set on an idyllic island.<br /><br />oddly enough, a very similar, or should i say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by louis de bernieres. this wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful pelagia, daughter of doctor iannis, and their life on kefalonia during wwii. pelagia's fiancee, local fisherman mandras, enlists when the italian army invades northern greece from albania under false pretenses. when the axis finally prevails, with a lot of help from the germans, a garrison of italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and captain corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time. as mandras joins the partisans, charming corelli and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. of course, this makes it a novel about love. but it is also a war novel, a summary of greek history, a tale of communist uprising in post-war greece, a portrait of the madness of mussolini, and, most importantly, an ode to island life on kefalonia.<br /><br />some of these elements return in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. i am glad nobody ever tried.<br /><br />the movie 'captain corelli's mandolin', however, is worth seeing. just make sure you read the book *after* you see the movie.
