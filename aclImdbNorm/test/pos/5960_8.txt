this is probably one of the best french movies i had seen in a very long time! this "pastiche" or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end. some references to today's world are very subtle. the whole maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of today's french culture/environment. that said, all the jokes and - seemingly - shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context, are permitted and accepted because this is a parody. <br /><br />i was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that i should go too and assured me that i was going to have a great time, and indeed i had! if you liked the old 007 movies with sean connery and also like movies like airplane or hot shots, you will be delighted. i just hope this movie is released on dvd in the us... wait and see.
