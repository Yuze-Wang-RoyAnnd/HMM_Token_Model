i had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, july of 2007. i can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. the story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the civil war. i cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life. the costumes and sets were gorgeous! i thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts i and ii. part iii is a disappointment.
