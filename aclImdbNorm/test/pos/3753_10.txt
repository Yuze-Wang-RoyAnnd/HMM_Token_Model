here in germany it was only shown on tv one time. today, as everything becomes mainstream, it's absolute impossible, to watch a film like this again on the screen. maybe it's the same in usa, or especially gb. the message is a brutal truth : find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality, or you become a loser, if not an asshole instead.<br /><br />the whole film is not particularly as simple, as it may seem here. every little scene, every sentence, every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen, when one person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd, which calls itself normal.<br /><br />very well played by all this is a must seen. who is the main character? john (not cox, folks, remember ;-) ore niles (who still is bimbo) decide and you will get the plot as it is intended.<br /><br />a bitter look at what society becomes in a repressive system. kind of salingers catcher in the rye and goldings lord of the flies thought to the very end.<br /><br />the final maybe change your own mind. word
