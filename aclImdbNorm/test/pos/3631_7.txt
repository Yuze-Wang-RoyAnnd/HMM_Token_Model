let's be fair: there are no rules for scriptwriting, so i won't say the movie should be something other than it is. i'll just state my opinion. ok, i really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. however, i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. since this movie was directed by jo~ao falc~ao, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical. it's the man's first movie, for cryin' out-loud! what i'm saying is, there are parts in the film - like the city of nordestina, which slightly resembles the set of "hoje 'e dia de maria" - that feel like we're not at a movie theater. we're at the theater! lines are spoken too formally, characters are moving choreographically, and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage. sure, maybe that was the intention, but that's been done. on stage. wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie - the beautiful "closer", for instance. when i went to see this one, though, i didn't feel like i was watching a movie. but overall, it was a good one, worth watching. it's a nice love story, funny at times and sad at others. my vote is a 7.
