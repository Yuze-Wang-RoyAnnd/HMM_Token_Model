my wife and i endorse all the positive comments below, made by other imdb members. while this is no box office smash hit it has a special charm all of its own. genuine and heart-warming.<br /><br />we saw this on video, at the end of a long day. we were very tired, and in bed. normally in a situation like this my wife drops off to sleep within minutes, that is, unless it is an exceptional movie and this one kept us both entertained right to the very end.<br /><br />perhaps younger viewers in their teens and twenties would not like this, but for the rest of us it is a true gem! see it!
