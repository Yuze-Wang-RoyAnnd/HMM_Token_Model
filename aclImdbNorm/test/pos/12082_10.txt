who will love my children has changed my heart, it made me cry all the way through, the most i cried with was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby, i cried the most with that, and each time a child was adopted, i cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad for them to lose their mother, i felt sorry for the kid with epilepsy, i was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. to me that boy i thought was the special one because he was going in a home. i feel that i am special because i am in a world with aspergers syndrome and sometimes when i feel down, i sometimes like to cry. i really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. a true story, very good. another movie that would bring tears to your eyes i think would haver to be tuesday's with morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
