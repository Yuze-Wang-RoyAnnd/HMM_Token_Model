i honestly found wicked little things to be a very cool and fun horror film.my friend had given this to me, and i really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror film.then after i watched this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times, and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good.i thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother(she seemed very believable and to me very likable).and while it is a little clich'e'e and over the top its good.overall i gotta say if the afterdark horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this, but if you like horror films, or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
