i agree with bigalc - this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before i went to live in japan for a year in 1993. tom selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the movie is greatly humorous and educational. i'm a big fan of tom selleck's, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part, bringing the film to life in a way i can't imagine any other actor being able to pull off. <br /><br />this film featured some first-rate japanese actors, and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with selleck - i can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie - japan's an awesome place to go, whether you want to party, sight-see or just try to take everything in.
