peter segal's 1995 commercial hit & now cult-classic 'tommy boy' is a hilarious film, an evergreen entertainer. chris farley is a talent which we'll never ever forget!!! <br /><br />'tommy boy' is a simple story, told in the funniest & zany way possible. farley & spade take a journey which is filled with unstoppable laughter, even the rob lowe portion is damn funny. as a kid, i remember watching 'tommy boy' again and again and again. it's been of my childhood favorites, and it will always remain to be. even today when it comes on t.v. i stick to it as a die-hard fan. i am quite possessive about this film. <br /><br />segal's direction is super. chris farley might have died in 1997, but remains alive for me, at least. what an actor! watch his work in 'tommy boy', he's so much at ease. he delivered fantastic performances later on in films like 'berverly hills ninja' & 'almost heroes', but his work in here remains as his best to date! love you, farley! spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. he's an excellent actor in all respects! <br /><br />'tommy boy' rules.... 100 thumbs up from this writer!
