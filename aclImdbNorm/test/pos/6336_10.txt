this episode of buffy was one of my personal favorites. also number three of joss' personal favorites as well. the episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the emmy's decided it merited a nomination. unfortunately it didn't win. when hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of season four. that should tell you something. even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. those gentlemen characters (who were played my mimes) were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced (or any network tv show i've seen). nothing is creepier then a bunch of silver teethed men coming at you with a scalpel while smiling away. i think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode.
