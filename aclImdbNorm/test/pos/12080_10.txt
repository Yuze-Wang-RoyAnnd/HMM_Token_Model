i watched this film many years ago on tv and taped it from there i could never really understand why my own mother was upset watching it! it was because i was so young at the time. i have just sat and watched this film again i now have 2 children of my own and i had to try and fight the tears back but that didn't happen i was crying through most of the film it just go's to show how different you feel when you have children of your own! such an amazing family such a heart wrenching film truly wonderful! someone has said about 8 still living any more news are you all still in touch i would love to know! touched by the film all over!
