joline (heather graham) married carl (luke wilson) and about five hundred and some days later, carl is very depressed and leaves her, expecting to `clean the fog' in their lives. joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to look for carl in texas. she is very supported by her brother jay (casey affleck), who meets her in the border of mexico. there, joline meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision, while jay knows carmen (patricia velasquez) and starts dating her, and in the end `life goes on'. this movie is very unpredictable, having a very different story. i believe it is an independent production. in some parts, it is a little slow and boring, but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile. i liked it, and my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): `rebeldes at'e o fim' (`rebels until the end')<br /><br />
