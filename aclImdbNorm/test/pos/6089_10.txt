tep is like a long cool drink of water after crawling across the sahara to classic film buffs who have been too long deprived of that certain cinematic magic! not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed. if you're looking for the film to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. instead, it is an excellent "companion" to the book, and i think that is what anthony minghella intended. ralph fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; not to mention a brilliant actor. juliette binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm. and, of course, i'll go see any film in which kristin scott thomas is featured. she simply must be the best actress since the likes of deborah kerr. so much was promised with this film, and so much is delivered!
