this one started excellently. the photography and audio are the best i've experienced in years (okay, months). especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. also, making jennifer lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but i'm not sure what singh wants to accomplish with that.<br /><br />now for the minuses. the screenplay was awful. lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. she seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. the three beds seemed just too obvious. the baptizing of the child carl was a psychologically too underlined way to embark the motive which carl 'worked' under. and so on..<br /><br />anyway, the movie had great way of showing where singh comes from. why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from india nowadays?
