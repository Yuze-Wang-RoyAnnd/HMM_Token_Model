if you don't like italian horror, you won't like this film. on that note...<br /><br />"overall... it was a terrible experience... many things happened. vanessa redgrave was scheduled to be in the film, and she pulled out. one of the actors was crushed by a car. i was engaged to be married, but by the end of the picture that was finished. my father died during the shooting... all kinds of things." -dario argento on the making of "opera"<br /><br />i was truly impressed with argento and the film he made here-- especially against such harrowing circumstances. the whole mystique of "macbeth" and its curse on those who attempt to stage the play adds untold volumes to "opera."<br /><br />throughout the film, argento imploys some of his most clever (and audience directed) tricks. a young opera singer, christina, is stalked by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders. by taping several sharp blades to christina's eyelids the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes, "take a good look. if you try to close your eyes, you'll tear them apart. so you'll just have to watch everything!"<br /><br />it is clear that argento put great care into constructing the faux "macbeth" opera on-screen, and his hard work pays off. add to this several unforgettably brutal murders, an incredibly tense chase sequence, and the genius use of pov to portray a certain character (the role vanessa redgrave pulled out on, thank god) and you've got one of the best italian horror films ever created.<br /><br />that said-- it's still italian horror. why christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murders is beyond anyone's comprehension. some scenes might be difficult for certain viewers to stomach, but personally i felt more tension towards christina and her eyes than any of the brutal slayings in the film. the finale to "tenebrae" had my stomach churning more than anything in "opera," but that's probably just me.<br /><br />and the last five minutes... argento wanted it, he filmed it, and he's fought to keep it in the film. absolutely no one likes it, myself included, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the film for me. it remains one of argento's best films to date.<br /><br />9/10
