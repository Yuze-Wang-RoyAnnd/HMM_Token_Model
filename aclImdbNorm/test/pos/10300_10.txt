on the outside, this film is better because of vincent d'onofrio (law & order: criminal intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version. in some ways, the 1999 version is better because it's more up to date (a decade as compared to the 27 years. the actors in this film were great, like terry kinney (mcmanus of hbo's "oz") as james daly and tony shalhoub (usa's monk) and gary sinise (csi:ny). obvilubuly, dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences, nut much of the writing remained the same. there were stuff that wasn't in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy, but in the end, this film was just as great at the 1982 one. character-wise: vincent d'onofrio playing phil romano was excellent, better that paul sorvino. it's a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james. as for george, i would praise shalhoub. and between martin sheen & sinsise as tom, i would say sinise wins.
