although perhaps not as entertaining as some of herzog's work, little dieter is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists. departing from herzog's usual themes, little dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life-alteringly traumatic experience. <br /><br />dieter dengler wanted to fly from a very young age, and the viet nam war gave him that opportunity, but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit, he spent most of it grounded as a pow. dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with occasional help from herzog. herzog does very little voice over this time, but contributes a lot of subtly powerful soundscaping and visuals - which should be no surprise to those familiar with him.<br /><br />dengler is a fascinating and extremely likable person. as human and as alive as they come, i found the story of his life and his incorrigibly upbeat personality to be inspiring. thanks to herzog for (re)introducing him to us.<br /><br />the scale of the film is not as sprawling, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made herzog a force to be reckoned with. nevertheless, i strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. it's a very interesting and well executed film.
