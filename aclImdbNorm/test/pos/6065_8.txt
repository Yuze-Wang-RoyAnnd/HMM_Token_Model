first off, i'm an american -- i haven't seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a u.s. viewer. secondly, i work in the television business in development. so i wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of american broadcast programming. "unit one" is an example of television that's a throwback to what i would attribute as '70s-style scripting, feature-wise. namely, those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development. it tacks more along the lines of stellar british dramas like "cracker" and "prime suspect" as well as australia's brilliant "underbelly." "unit one" features stand-alone cases that are committed, then solved, each week. the mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine. they usually center around one single twist, clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark, and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter. what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2. these are real, breathing, alive characters that have personal baggage, yet it's not a talky, batty type of baggage that american flotsam such as "grey's anatomy" or "desperate housewives" spoons out. these are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series, as if you work with them on a daily basis. after the mindless decade of "csi's," "ncis's," and "criminal minds," along with their subsequent spawns, it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with, as is the case with "unit one." the quippy banter, the unemotional wooden dialogue, and the over-the-top jeopardy that those american series i mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable danish series. i'm on episode 7 of the first season, but i've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul. if you need explosions and farcically-hopped up testosterone, along with music by the who and fast-cutting, neon-lit, jittery palsy-cam action with cipher-like main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing, i suggest you stay away from this series. if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle, poignant, thoughtful and, yes, sometimes straight-forward procedural crime dramas, i urge you to check this show out.
