this is the best movie i've ever seen. and i've seen a lot. i'm not even a troma fan. i've never heard of troma before watching this movie.<br /><br />i had already given up hope to see a great movie until i saw "tromeo and juliet". this movie is a dream coming true. shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. there are sex, violence, humor and satire. it breaks many taboos.<br /><br />this movie is neither disgusting nor stupid. it's hard to describe with words how clever, funny, exciting and witty this movie is. the music is great and perfectly fits every scene. the characters are very believable and the acting is great. i really cared for the characters.<br /><br />it is certainly not for troma's fans only. it's for all people who have a sense of humor and like clever and believable entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that don't dare to do what this movie does.<br /><br />the bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional. you either love it or hate it. like all true works of art it isn't understood and appreciated by all people.
