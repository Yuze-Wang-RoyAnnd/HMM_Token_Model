"bon voyage" has the fast pace that in some ways reminds me of the indiana jones/star wars films -- it's as if you're on a fast train or roller coaster.<br /><br />it's billed as a romance, mystery, thriller, and farce; it's all of that and more including candid observations on the reactions of french society during the nazi invasion at the start of wwii. and it's also an exhibition of juggling that involves 7 main characters. the scenes all seemed historically accurate (to my eyes) and gave an excellent feeling for the period.<br /><br />all of the actors were well cast and gave great performances but imo the most superb was that by isabelle adjani who played the role of an opportunistic, self-centered french movie star; not only did she quite convincingly play the role of a young actress perhaps half her age but she also played her amorous wiles convincingly yet in such a way that the audience sees she's only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold digger. her character and energy propel the film through from beginning to end. it wasn't until i read roger ebert's review that i discovered she was 48 years old at the time of the film. what beauty!!<br /><br />i appreciated the ending -- it's satisfying but lets you write your own conclusion as to what happens to the main characters. <br /><br />as another user commenter observed -- do not arrive late; you need to be there from the opening scene. good advice.<br /><br />i gave it 9 of 10.
