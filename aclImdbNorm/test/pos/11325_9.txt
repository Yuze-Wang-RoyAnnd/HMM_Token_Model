this lasted several years despite the late hour it was on.<br /><br />like a lot of 80's crime dramas, it looked cold. both physically and figuratively. this isn't a bad thing though. and the (obviously) low budget actually worked in it's favor. gritty during a time when 'slick' was in.<br /><br />allan royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge.<br /><br />the only actors i remembered were scott nylands (earthquake) and tony rosato (sctv). the cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a 'star.' and yes, that's a young clark johnson (homicide) in a recurring spot.<br /><br />i hope a dvd release is in the future. someone out there wanna get on that?
