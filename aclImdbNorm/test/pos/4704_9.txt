this is truly a documentary of love about a fascinating character, her outlook on life and her extended family. the filmmakers spent three years taping sister helen at her halfway house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help but feel you know sister helen and her "boys." the house holds 21 recovering addicts each with a story almost as involving as sister helen's. the ending scenes are particularly involving and emotional.<br /><br />sister helen's story of marriage, addiction and loss reveals a very complex character who's tough love is at all times funny, touching and endearing.<br /><br />the film is a amazing in the way it tells its story in wonderful slice of life sequences which develop into a story that is almost as clear as if each scene were scripted and acted by the best. the honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of the "clients" is very involving as you learn of their fears and watch their attempts to grow.<br /><br />you will never forget sister helen, robert, moe or poor ashish(spelling?).
