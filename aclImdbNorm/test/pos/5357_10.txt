when wallace and gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, "a grand day out," they created a fresh new look at claymation. after two more shorts, aardman's dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. it has an excellent voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only aardman could do! <br /><br />in this movie, wallace and gromit run "anti-pesto," a rabbit removal company. when word gets out about a "were-rabbit" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. of course, victor quartermaine, the town's handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely lady tottington...but can our favorite aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues?<br /><br />the jokes, i should say, were hilarious. one point, the villain, victor quartermaine's, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: "beware...the moon!!!" vintage aardman!<br /><br />the characters are crisp and hilarious. our favorite aardman team of man and dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second oscar (remember "a grand day out?"). helena bonham carter was terrific as the lovely lady tottington, wallace's love interest. ralph fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter victor quartermaine. but the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief. <br /><br />hats off to aardman for creating another wallace and gromit masterpiece!
