i've just finished seeing the film for the first time in it's entirety (although i watched some parts when it was first shown in britain in the mid-90's), i truly believe it to be a masterpiece of late twentieth century cinema. undoubtledly a film of this scope raises lots of questions, like why are there some narrative differences between the 60's hermann in 'heimat' and hermann in this film? for example, in the first film hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather (he funds hermann's electronic music), whereas in "die zweite..." there is little mention of his dad until the final episode.<br /><br />one other point does interest me; reading up on edgar reitz i'm struck by historical similarities between him and the stefan character, (spoiler coming) in the last episode it is revealed that stefan has won a prize at the venice film festival, (reitz won an award for best debut work there for his film "mahlzeiten"); reitz's film company is called 'edgar reitz filmproduktion' and stefan's is also eponymously named. i'm interested in stefan being an autobiographical character because aside from helga he is probably the least likable of the friends. <br /><br />maybe stefan's a red herring, i don't know, what i do know is that i loved this film and wish that more were made like it, with the exception of michael haneke's "cache" and werner herzog's "grizzly man" there's not enough ambition, audacity and passion of this sort in modern cinema. i can't wait to see number 3 now.
