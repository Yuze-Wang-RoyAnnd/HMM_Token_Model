much about this movie was beautiful. the acting, the scenery, and without a doubt, aaron's cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots. definitely worth watching, as your attention will be captivated the entire time, and it ends on just the right note.<br /><br />the acting by newcomer jonathan furr was superb, as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born. he has gone on to act in other feature films, but this starring role will always be remembered.<br /><br />the film does have that academy award feel to it at times, where it's slow and scenic and quiet, so it's not a movie that a.d.d. kids can sit through. however, the rustic feel of east bend and yadkinville played out well as a 1940's era film.
