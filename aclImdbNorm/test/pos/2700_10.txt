i have been watching king of queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. this show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because i work at a company a lot like ips, (dhl) and we just love the teamster plugs!! carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. arthur well what can you say? he just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things. doug, well he is just so lovable, and funny, the three characters, plus all the friends just make the show complete. this is the best comedy on tv!! i would say up there with seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that .... excellente!! as doug would say.
