another period piece for chen kiage... (can't remember him doing a modern film!)...<br /><br />good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. none of the hk fighting scenes, or the hollywood type of heroes, but it is good because of it. the characters are strong, i really felt for them.<br /><br />understanding the mandarin definitely gives the english subtitles the edge. the film is 3 hours, but it didn't feel like it.
