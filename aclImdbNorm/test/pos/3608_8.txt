to say the truth, i went to see this movie only because nicolas cage is my favorite actor. folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. i haven't seen a movie with penelope crus before, so i was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. so, here's what i think:<br /><br />the movie is good (i haven't read the novel, however). some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple. so the only thing that could save the movie, which (an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning) would either end tragically or happily, was the performance of both cage and crus. and it was great, great, great!!! in the latter part of the movie i even liked a rather broad accent of the actress (spanish, but for those who don't speak greek that's ok, and she even looks like a greek girl). overall the movie is highly enjoyable and has a good deal of irony (fans of classical music will surely have fun at some moments:)<br /><br />i give it 9/10. you should see it!
