i love this movie. and disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. i think they should definitely put susie q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where i can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. online, or anywhere. i told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. all these disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring. i need susie q back!! it was a great movie and had great actors and i don't see why it was taken off the air. if everyone loves this movie so much why was it taken off the air. please take my comment into consideration and along with all of the other comments made to this movie. thank you, have a nice day.
