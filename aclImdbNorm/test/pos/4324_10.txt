first of all, i just have to say that i'm a huge lost fan. everyone who makes the show, i love 'em. it's got everything in it, really.<br /><br />i'm glad that they have great people making it, for instance jack bender is the greatest director, well, maybe after j.j. abrams. and of course, full credit to damon lindelof & carlton cuse. they're geniuses.<br /><br />anyway, the season 2 finale is definitely one of the best episodes of lost ever!!! live together, die alone focuses on desmond david hume's story of getting to the island, and henry ian cusick is so great playing that character! the makers of the show would have been very stupid if they would've let old'des die on us.<br /><br />so, in lost, the plane crash survivors have been there for 65 days.. 65 days, man. whileas rousseau has been there for sixteen years, and the others have been there for god knows how long. referring to jeffrey lieber, lindelof & abrams. anyway, i hope we'll get the answers we need, in season 3. can't wait! my vote is nine.
