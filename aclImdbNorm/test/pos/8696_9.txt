so many early british sound films that i've seen on video suffer from either poor print transfer quality or poor sound or both. fortunately, i was able to obtain a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality, enabling me to focus on the story itself.<br /><br />and, an excellent story it was. at first sight, the passengers on the ill-fated bus looked like a pretty boring lot (except for the always lovely jessie matthews). but, as the film went back to show each passenger's story on the day before the accident, i discovered that the cast, contrary to initial appearance, was a talented group of performers, skillfully directed so as to bring a real individuality to their distinctive characterizations.<br /><br />viewers may have different preferences as to which two passengers are going to meet a tragic end and which ones will survive. but, the movie holds your interest as it keeps you guessing. this film deserves a much wider audience - a real gem of early british cinema.
