a very potent drama of faulkner's small town south dealing with an innocent black man's murder of local ne'er do wll. striking cinematography and good narrative (via flashback) take us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. a still powerful story that predates the sidney poitier films of racial prejudice. porter hall has a great role as the murdered man's father. trivia: this was actually filmed in faulkner's home town of oxford, miss. with many of the residents used as extras.
