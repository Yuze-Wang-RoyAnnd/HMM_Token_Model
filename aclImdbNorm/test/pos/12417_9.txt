five minutes in, i started to feel how naff this was looking, you've got a completely unheroic hero and his overweight fool of a friend. seen it all before, yeah right. i was getting ready to be bored out of my mind for a good few hours. this is something i have become quite used to... haven't we all. then after a few minutes of testosterone fuelled insults and such, the truck appeared. okay the filming techniques used to make it look fast were clumsy, but who cares! that truck is amazing! soon however that is taken away again and we're back to the geek and his overweight friend. but now i'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible. i then proceed to be amazed again and again by the cleverness of the film. there are so many jokes at their expense, it's like everyone in the world is in on this except the two of them. the mind behind the makeup and effects was a genius i swear it. believe me, if you are a man you miss so many of the jokes in this film, there is so much here that only a girl can understand.<br /><br />brother bob is by far the best hillbilly killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that he's sewn together just adds to the effect. there are of course some really dud science facts in here, but isn't that always the case. when our 'hero' is having a nose bleed and using the blood to lead brother bob to his death, now that is rubbish. there is no way a nose bleed can be that bad and not mean a severed artery or something. i'm all with the use of too much blood, but that is taking it a little too far. the incest jokes are a little predictable but funny nonetheless. and the way brother bob meets his end is more than classic. overall, this movie rules, it really breaks out of the overacted melodramatic strain of horror that we got so much of in 2003-2005. the end of this move simply could not have been better.<br /><br />this is a definite must watch for anyone who likes their horror with several side orders of gore and attitude.
