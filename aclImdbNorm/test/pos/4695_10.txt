to quote jason connery and mark ryan on one of the many dvd commentaries, that "wobbly music" over the htv logo was enough to get me jumping from whatever i was doing to glue my face against the screen for an hour. the individual stories contained within the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. robin of loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he appears in, even though his departure from the programme was unplanned. marian also develops her relationship with both of herne's sons very well.<br /><br />after languishing for many years in tv wasteland, i re-encountered the series on sky 1 in the uk in the mid nineties and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than i remembered. this is no children's television programme, it deals with witchcraft, treason, rebellion and injustice. and, it manages to do it without showing too much blood. as far as i can recall, you only see a bit of the red stuff in the pilot film (episodes 1 and 2 on the dvd set). the dvds are great, containing a wealth of extras including cast commentaries on series 3 only (the jason connery robin) and crew commentaries for series 1 and 2. the picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing.<br /><br />the idea of freedom is important, freedom prevails. nothing's forgotten. nothing's ever forgotten.
