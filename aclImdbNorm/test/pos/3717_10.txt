remember that this came out before gulf war i, which gave us werner herzog's "lessons of darkness".<br /><br />le dernier combat is not "sci fi". it's more like judgment. i've watched it at least a dozen times. it really is a fitting companion to herzog's "lessons of darkness": "and in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them."<br /><br />that someday, alas, may be today, in iraq. <br /><br />but, back to le dernier combat, make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film. i wouldn't call it a "surprise ending", but it is something you'll miss if you just assume the end won't be anything more than what you will already have seen.
