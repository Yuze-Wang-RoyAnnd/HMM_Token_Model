yes 1939/robert donat-greer garson version was the best...perfection..donat won the oscar in a very tough year..gable in gwtw & james stewart as mr. smith. were 2 of his competitors. .wow was that a rough year.. most critics in ny hated this version. so.didnt see in theatre! finally saw this a.m. on tcm & enjoyed..peter o'toole was excellent & glad he was oscar nominated for this,,& esp pleased oscar finally gave him a special award this past year... petula clark was good as mrs. chips but her character,i feel was poorly written...some good songs esp. you & i... sung by ms.clark & later recorded by many others including t.bennett/s. bassey & carmen macrae.... the b&w version was more authentic.. but this is a good film beautifully photographed in color & panavision... enjoyable worth seeing & bravo, again, mr. o'toole!
