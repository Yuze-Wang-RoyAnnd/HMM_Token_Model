after being off the air for a while, columbo returned with some new made-for-tv mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s.<br /><br />"murder can be hazardous to your health" used the then (and i guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. the murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, george hamilton (in a nice bit of casting). his chain-smoking nemesis, who lost the job to him, played by peter haskell, attempts to blackmail hamilton when he discovers a porno video hamilton made with an underage actress in his salad days. hamilton uses haskell's cigarettes to deliver the death blow via poison, giving himself an alibi as well.<br /><br />columbo is brought in to find out what happened. you know the rest. highly entertaining.
