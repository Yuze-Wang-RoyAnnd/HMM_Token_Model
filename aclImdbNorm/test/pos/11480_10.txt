i consider this film to be a complete masterpiece - actually i consider it to be fernando fragata's best work and undoubtedly the best of all portuguese movies. i don't think you can come across such a "zero budget" kind of film as impressive and astonishing as this one.<br /><br />the direction is done with perfection at an incredible fast pace and the music also composed by fragata is mostly excellent. the story is creepy and humorous at the same time, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying "misery loves company" kind of situations intertwined with a mind boggling mystery. a more than perfect recipe to glue the viewers' eyes to the screen from frame one to the last.<br /><br />it's been called neo-hitchcock, and i'll agree. much like the best hitchcocks, it kept me guessing during the entire film and most of my suppositions were far for what ends up being smartly revealed.
