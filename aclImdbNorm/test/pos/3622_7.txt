spike milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'puckoon' is sadly no exception. the novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'puckoon' of the title ). due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in northern ireland, the other half is in the republic. locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. a dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him.<br /><br />'puckoon' is a sort of irish 'under milk wood' with comic characters and surreal happenings galore. the lead character, dan milligan ( renamed 'madigan' in the film ) is impishly played by sean hughes, and has conversations with the narrator ( richard attenborough ). also in the film is milo o'shea, griff rhys jones, david kelly ( from 'robin's nest' ), freddie jones, joe mcgann, and elliott gould.<br /><br />interviewed for the 'making of 'puckoon' documentary, writer/director terence ryan expressed undying admiration for the book. it shows on screen. but, alas, like the ill-fated film of 'the hitch-hiker's guide to the galaxy', a good book does not necessarily make a good film. the trouble with 'puckoon' is that, like milligan's other books, they simply do not work on the big screen. 'puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot.<br /><br />no way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'sex lives of the potato men', 'fat slags', and 'lesbian vampire killers', but then neither is it as good as it should have been. the last half-hour involves a lot of running around by the police, the british army, some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin, and is really tedious to sit through. ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film.<br /><br />the other problem is the total absence of charm. 'waking ned' had this in spades, while the 'father ted' television series was funnier by far. spike lived long enough to see the film, and apparently enjoyed it. his daughter, jane, has a cameo as madigan's bride.<br /><br />the highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning: "i don't mind dying!", said spike: "i just don't want to be there when it happens!".
