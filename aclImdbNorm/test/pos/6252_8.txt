don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started? it sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herrings before some real action takes place. "tourist trap" isn't like that! if it's typically gruesome slashing you want...than it's typically gruesome slashing you'll get! plenty of it and constantly from start to finish! this movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in 80's horror cinema when a teenager, on a stroll after engine trouble, is trapped in a deserted house and assaulted by a creepy collection of wax statues. four other lambs to the slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an utterly insane maniac that looks somewhat like a mixture of leatherface (from "texas chainsaw massacre") and one of those mad sculptors from old wax-museum movies. "tourist trap" is exciting horror entertainment, with some genuine suspense, grisly images, ultimate weirdness, morbid humor and terrific make-up effects. the plot twists aren't always original and the acting is pretty lousy but, seriously, who cares? the fast pacing and the groovy killer-icon caused this "tourist trap" to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers. a bit surprising is the total lack of nudity, though. too bad, because all the girls look ravishing and after only 10 minutes, the obligatory line "who needs a bathing-suit?" is spoken.
