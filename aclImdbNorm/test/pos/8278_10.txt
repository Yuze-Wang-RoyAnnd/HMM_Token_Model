if your a child of the 80's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the 80's. how can you not love those great chipmunks (don't forget about the chippettes), lines, and songs. years later i can still sing every word to every song. the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today. it's just pure fun and worth the rent, even if your all grown up.
