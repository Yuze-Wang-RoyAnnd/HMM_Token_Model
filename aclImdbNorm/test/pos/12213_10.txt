i enjoy the show surface very much. the show is very entertaining and it's a clean show. a show like surface is interesting. it keeps my attention. it has compassion and suspense. i love all the cast members that are on the show. they are all very good choices. i think it is very important to have the right cast of any show because thats what makes any show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself. television has changed so much over the years. it has changed in good ways and in bad. i love to watch some comedy,action, suspense and romance. and scifi. but surface is a show that i hope comes back for many seasons because it is a great show and its something that families can watch. my children are grown, but my husband and i enjoy watching these types of shows. i appreciate your time and letting me comment my opinion. <br /><br />thanks.<br /><br />paulette blackwell
