greetings again from the darkness. based on the mega-best seller from author khaled hosseini, the film provides us a peak at the ugliness of post-russia invaded afghanistan and the terror of the taliban. director marc foster adds a gem to his resume, which already includes "monster's ball", "finding neverland" and "stranger than fiction".<br /><br />the story of young friends amir and hassan and the unknown bond they share into the next generation. this is a story of honor and courage and loyalty and is an unusual coming-of-age tale. some great scenes of the boys when they are kids and then a couple of truly amazing scenes as amir returns as an adult to find hassan's imprisoned son.<br /><br />this is tight, compelling story telling with a message. the acting is solid throughout, with no one actor stealing the screen. although not a pleasant story to watch unfold, it is certainly meaningful and heart felt. plus a quick shot of midnight oil playing in the pool hall is a welcome gift.
