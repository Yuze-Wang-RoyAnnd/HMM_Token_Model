how often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? waldo's last stand is a refreshment. here waldo is selling lemonade but isn't making any money. alfalfa, spanky, darla, mickey, and buckwheat come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 men in a tub and came the brawn where there was competition between alfalfa and waldo for darla's affection. back to the story: the gang taste the lemonade to see if waldo made it right. one funny moment is when alfalfa gets a glass cup for lemonade and waldo fills is and gives it to darla and alfalfa has an angry expression on his face. spanky proposes a floor show to go with the lemonade and even mickey agrees ever so cute. when the floor show begins there is no one at the barn but then a customer comes in (froggy). spanky asks him if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod no. spanky asks him numbers of time in the short and every time froggy nods no spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny. spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. one way is when after mickey said ever so cutely "those crackers are salty and they made me thirsty". there is also many entertain musical bit is this short. the opening number is by darla which she tap dances and sings. the second includes alfalfa singing off-key (as usually) with mickey, leonard, spanky, and buckwheat about "how dry i am!" (i believe they sing that to make froggy thirsty. it also made me laugh.). the closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way. this was waldo's last our gang short. a grand musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10.
