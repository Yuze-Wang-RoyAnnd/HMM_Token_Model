this is a really great film! it gets you thinking about your parents. how we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. and just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. definitely see this documentary! imdb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. usually online comments need to be short short, and here i am being asked to write more! well i went to see the film with my parents, i thought afterward they would want to talk about their parents, but my dad kept wanting to talk about himself and things in his life he feels he screwed up, which was unusual, my dad is not a reticent man, but i was surprised that he wanted to talk about mistakes he thinks he made. mike and kitty came to the film to do a q & a and there was a hilarious moment afterward when my dad was talking with mike, while my mom spoke with kitty! really just disregard my last few sentences to pad this comment, and just remember '51 birch street,' go see it!
