having read the book prior to watching this adaptation you would think that it would have lost some of its thrill. however, the story is so clever i could never tire of it. <br /><br />sally and elaine really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters. i fell in love with the story and the women all over again.<br /><br />beautiful to watch thanks to direction, settings and costumery. despite the plot speed of television, i don't feel that anything important was lost in transit. it had me on the edge of my seat throughout with lots of wonderful stomach-trembling moments. enjoyed it thoroughly. this is the kind of television i have been waiting for.
