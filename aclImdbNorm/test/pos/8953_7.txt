this was the film that started that the cinematic love affair<br /><br />between the jaundiced eye crew and matthew ferguson. his<br /><br />ability to portray relatively normal characters like birkoff in<br /><br />"la femme nikita" is counter-balanced by his equally deft<br /><br />handling of weirdos like "kane." one wishes that he would only<br /><br />be given more roles, bigger roles, and other, even more complex<br /><br />roles to assay to push the limits of his abilities. there were<br /><br />four or five memorable scenes in this film, and matthew ferguson<br /><br />stole two of them from far more experienced actors. this film<br /><br />itself is good, and it is worth watching on its own merits, but<br /><br />ferguson makes it a little extra special. his *ouevre* may<br /><br />eventually show what the career of anthony perkins might have<br /><br />been like if he hadn't been typecast as "norman bates" so long<br /><br />ago. "kane" isn't quite as whacked-out as norman, and far fewer<br /><br />people saw "love and human remains than saw "psycho," so we can<br /><br />hope that ferguson will show us some hint of what perkins might<br /><br />have been able to accomplish, had he been allowed to do so. . . .
