this movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience. i think that a lot of people get caught up in leland's apparent mental illness as the storyline, but i was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions. much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad, which is a little clich'e, but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have, whether you see the bad everywhere like leland, or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just isn't going to work no matter how bad you want it to. this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie i've seen, and it is as depressing a movie as it is good.
