i own this movie and i love canadian movies but hire an actress like rose i don't understand.she is completly useless in this movie just a name that's all.the rest of the cast is good,good enough to make this little thriller work.i was surprise by the plot which is not the first time it was used.but those unknown actors did very well even jergen,i'm not a big fan of his but i liked him in this movie.if you got the chance to see it go for it.
