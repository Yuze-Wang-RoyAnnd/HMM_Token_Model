being advertised as the most expensive movie ever made in the czech republic, it automatically makes the you think it will be over glorified and clich'ed (out of fear of the budget). however with a budget of 8 million and half the movie in english it was not exactly a big budget, high risk movie.<br /><br />what we have a grand epic tale centered around the friendship of two people, the younger karel and the older frantisek . as pilots in the czech air force when the germans invade before the beginning of world war ii they escape the country to england to joined the raf.<br /><br />their friendship becomes strained through the love of the same woman. however there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond merely being friendly. their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the czech people and their country. remember they were not the winners, the defeated the germans only to be invaded by the russians.<br /><br />funny, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and illuminating this movie is one of my favourite war movies. most of all i like the way they make fun of the british in a way that is amazingly affectionate and gives an amazing insight into the way the british military fought wwii.<br /><br />forget the recent american efforts (peal harbour, saving private ryan), this is the best wwii movie for a long time.
