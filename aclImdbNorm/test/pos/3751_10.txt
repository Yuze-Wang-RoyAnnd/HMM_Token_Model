i liked it better than house party 2 & 3. the cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. chris stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo in it as a car repairman; look for his mom who plays the lead character, john john's grandmother. and you can hear her rap the title song "down to the last minute" at the end of the film as the credits roll. she's very funny and a really good actress, as well. the young actors who star in it (the main trio), and who in reality are part of the music group imx, did a superb job. before this film i had not paid much attention to this r & b group. now i'm a fan. the music number in the house party scene alone is worth checking out the movie. i was pleasantly surprised. i loved it.
