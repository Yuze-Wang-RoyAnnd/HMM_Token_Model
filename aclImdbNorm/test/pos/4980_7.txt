stanwyck at her villainous best, robinson her equal - as ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western.<br /><br />some good action scenes, strong use of location, colour and cinemascope. but why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene?<br /><br />ford is dependable as always and foster is strong as robinson's daughter, but it is the baddies' film. and it's not just stanwyck and robinson - brian keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as stanwyck's lover, and richard jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer.<br /><br />see it for the camp value.
