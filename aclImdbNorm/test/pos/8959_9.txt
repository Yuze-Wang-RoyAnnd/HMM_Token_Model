once again, i am amazed that thomas gibson did not come to the head of the pack earlier in his career. in this film, gibson once again demonstrates his ability to grasp a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th century. tender yet not effeminate, afraid of the basic tenets of love, gibson's character touches a variety of emotions. also worthy of praise is cameron bancroft's performance. his need to be the heterosexual conqueror as opposed to his best friend's "homosexual conquests" provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected. bancroft and gibson's chemistry is apparent from the first scene they appear in together. there are many "panels" in this quilt. from gay relationships to straight relationships; from heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love; this film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer at its core. my only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before i discovered this movie! i look forward to seeing it again and highly recommend it to any fan of bancroft, gibson or director denys arcand.
