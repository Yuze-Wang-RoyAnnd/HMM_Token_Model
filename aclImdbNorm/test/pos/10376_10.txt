i was surprised that i liked this movie. but it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first friday the 13th. there were a number of cheesy elements, yet at the same time there were many cool ones. the story line was good--predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies, but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile. there are some memorable scenes worth watching. a few issues i had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. for instance in the opening scene the scarecrows (which were humans on stakes, whose blood was drained to grow the crops), looked very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks. there were more than several gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it sounded like how real people talk, unlike hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it. the culmination of the last scene, when the main character says "i'm not a baker, i'm a connell!" and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying, as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point.
