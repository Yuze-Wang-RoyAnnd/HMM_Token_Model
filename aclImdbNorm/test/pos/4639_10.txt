as many of the other comments i have read have noted, i fell in love with this movie when i was a kid. my sister and i had a copy of the movie on beta (before vhs) that we wore out. of course it didn't help when our parents sold the betamax at a garage sale. since then we have been trying to find a copy. i, like another commentator, did eventually locate a rental copy at a local video store. the owner would not part with the copy after any number of attempts to beg, bribe, and cry my way to owning the tape. good news! i bought a brand new, newly released, vhs copy of midnight madness for $9.99 on amazon.com two days ago!!!! finally, disney has wizened up. now, if they'll only rerelease song of the south... if you love the movie, grab it. if you haven't seen the movie, it's worth a check - totally stupid humor but a lot of fun (stephen furst is hilarious).
