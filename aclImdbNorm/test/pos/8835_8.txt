the history of tv to film adaptations are littered with aberrations which almost conclusively prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place. there are, however, some examples which manage to pull it off, just. rising damp would, at first, appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit. also the writer, eric chappell, wasn't being paid enough to spend time crafting an entirely original screenplay so he harvested a batch of tv episodes and stitched them together to form the body of the film. this, in itself, didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail. david croft and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for dad's army and it worked superbly. although, the early dad's army episodes, with their staid pace and over arcing plot, lent themselves far better to film adaptation. the rising damp episodes, however, were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax. as a result, as one story is concluded and another started, the scenes within the film become disjointed. another pitfall for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made. in this respect the film pales in comparison to rising damp's brilliant series. despite all this, rising damp the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally uproarious. it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film. this includes a rugby match where rossiter does a brilliantly timed pratfall. indeed, while all the cast handle their roles perfectly (bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale), it is leonard rossiter as rigsby that shines the most. in fact rising damp should have been made as a film just so rossiter could have been eligible for an oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent. criminally, he wasn't even nominated. ultimately, the film fails to match the giddy heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments. recommended viewing.<br /><br />one last thing: the opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history.
