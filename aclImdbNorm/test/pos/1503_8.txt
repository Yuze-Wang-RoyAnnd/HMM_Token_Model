i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i've ever seen. this film is packed with stupid dialog, ridiculous scenes, and a self-involving plot, starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself.<br /><br />the threadbare story-line is about an aging director (fulci, who is also named lucio fulci in the film...)who is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years. he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci, and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer, but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing. the rest of the film is made up of shots from the "film" that fulci is directing during all this action, scenes of the shrink killing people all-the-while grinning like a f!cking moron, and some of fulci's hallucination sequences. oh, and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well...<br /><br />a cat in the brain is completely over-top-and ridiculous in every sense. the gore is classic fulci - nasty and strong with some really decent scenes. the chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool, as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy. lots of stabbings, gougings and other cool kill-scenes make this one a pretty non-stop bloodbath. the ridiculous dialog (lick it!!!!lick it!!!), as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes (the nazi orgy, the opera singing slap-fest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind...) make this one fun as hell. not nearly as dark as some of fulci's other films - cat is more of a self-indulgent horror/comedy that if it wasn't meant to be funny, is actually kind of sad. i say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one. i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time. this is the feel-good movie of the summer...recommended 8/10
