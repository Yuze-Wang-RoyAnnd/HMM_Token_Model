count me as being one who is happy to see no hastings in this episode. the poor-man's dr. watson does nothing for me, as he simply drags down every scene he's in. japp is often necessary to the story as the representative of officialdom, and a little miss lemon is fine for seasoning, but hastings swings from painfully dim to over-mannered in different episodes. if i have to sit through one more vacuous "oh, i say there!" i'll take the gas-pipe.<br /><br />as a general rule, the more poirot you get in a poirot story, the better. every line for hastings is one taken away from poirot. and i've never read the books, so i really don't care about fidelity to christie's characters. a lot of viewers/reviewers seem to have a problem with separating the movies from the books. if you want the book as written, then read it. i don't see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage. theatre is not prose - don't expect a transcription.
