somehow, this film burrowed it's way into the soft spot of my heart. don't ask me how it happened, but i suppose having the film feature ed "i'll sponsor anything" mcmahon as a tail-chasing crack hustler had a bit to do with it.<br /><br />frankly, i was disappointed with slaughter's first outing in 1972. nothing more than a quick throw-together to follow shaft-mania. how does the sequel get away from this? big jim brown seems stronger as slaughter here than in the first. perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work from, instead of his simple "be like shaft" motivation before.<br /><br />the most outstanding part about the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp-daddy number one, james brown. almost every scene is graced with a touch of funk by the godfather. an excellent period film, for the music, wardrobe, vehicles, lingo, and hair. i should also point out this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in motion picture history when jim brown and ed mcmahon could actually grow hair.<br /><br />double the chicks, double the blow, triple the body count, and factor in ed mcmahon and james brown. you'll be in for one hell of a 70s action flick, and one that outshines it's predecessor no less. for my money, slaughter's big rip-off can play ball with any blaxploitation film ever made. even shaft. chances are you'll disagree, but slaughter's big rip-off has it's own distinct feel. something the original was lacking.
