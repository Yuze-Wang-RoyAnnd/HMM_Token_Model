i enjoyed two of the three movies in the "sarah, plain & tall" trilogy. this, the final of the three, was definitely one of the "good ones. " it is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: christopher walken, glenn close and jack palance. <br /><br />the storyline is simple but well-told. the only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. it was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie. <br /><br />of the three, that initial "sarah," was the best- filmed with some beautiful cinematography. this movie didn't have that, but it had the best story. it had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. <br /><br />highly recommended.
