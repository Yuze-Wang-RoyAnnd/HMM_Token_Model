so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie. as you probably know, this is the original french film, that was then remade (quelle surprise) by hollywood as wicker park. well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because, a) i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park, and living in chicago, i didn't see why they called it that - it was filmed in fricking canada for a start! - b) i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes, done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles (i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way) and c) i can't stand josh hartnett, 'nuff said there. <br /><br />however, i came across wp on tv the other day, probably about half an hour in, and i have to say initially, it made no sense at all, until about half an hour from the end, when it started coming together. by the end, i was really surprised to find myself really into it, and then the ending just seemed so good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen (heard??).<br /><br />since then i've heard a lot about the l'appartement vs. wicker park argument and looking at wp, i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago, but there seemed something about it that i liked, so when it was on again, i watched it again - unfortunately, still missing the first chunk (i've still yet to see it!), and i still thought it was pretty good. heck, even josh hartnett seemed good! but i was curious about l'appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. so i waited and waited to catch l'appartement somewhere somehow. netflix let me down, so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland. and i've just watched it. <br /><br />it's really kind of weird, but a good weird. a classic french film. great acting, romane bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene. vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works. and i've seen jean-philippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him - the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating! but, i can honestly say, having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy (as about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses?? word for word!!), you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l'appartement!! i can literally say i was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really! so, be prepared, if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you'll either be disappointed, or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history - a prime example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending, and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end. definitely catch this movie. oh and while you're at, maybe not too near the same time, but down the road, take a look at wicker park, it'll surprise you too.
