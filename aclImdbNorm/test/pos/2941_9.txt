yes, i am ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively devine!!!it's so entertaining, and i have the absolute greatest time watching it.ever since cycle 1 it's been great, and i haven't noticed a downfall in it's glory at all.tyra banks as you know is the host, and as fabulous as she is, there's also the other judges and co-hosts such as j. alexander, jay manuel, nigel barker, and twiggy.the main point of the show is for every girl invited to become america's next top model, has to work their way up to the top by completing and winning photo shoot competitions.it sounds great already doesn't it, and let me tell you it is great!!!!!it's awesome watching all the different kinds of photo shoots the girls take, and each one is different, cool, and daring.anybody who hates this show, doesn't have a clue, and i will tell you that this show will be on for a long time, so deal with it!!!
