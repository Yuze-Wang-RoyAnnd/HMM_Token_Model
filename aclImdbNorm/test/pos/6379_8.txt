i think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen deviyan'. we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great. but we were in for a pleasant surprise. the movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times. the music was wonderful and dev anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. i still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over. <br /><br />whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time? no he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons. one is homely, one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help dev in his career as a poet. the question is which one is the 'one' for him. what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too. when things come to an impasse, a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision.<br /><br />this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black-n-white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today. if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.
