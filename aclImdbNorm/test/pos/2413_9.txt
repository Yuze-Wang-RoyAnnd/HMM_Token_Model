for once a sequel to "the karate kid" without ralph macchio! hilary swank did an excellent job playing the orphan julie pierce. pat morita, the one who plays mr. miyagi worked his way with julie quite different from daniel. both daniel and julie favored karate. unlike daniel, julie was the most surly person miyagi ever challenged. and there was no tournament to compete in. and there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. i liked the part where when julie came home from school, miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process. that was very funny! and the classic "wax on, wax off" scene was different as well. it was funny when miyagi tells julie, "uh-oh, missed spot". the set in boston was a far cry from california. the militant group in that group, was like the "cobra kai" in boston. and michael ironside's col. dugan was no john kreese. his group practically deserted him when julie kicked some serious butt. they all paid the price when they blew up that classic oldsmoblie. what a cowardly act. at least they'll find redemption from dugan's poison. this karate kid sets some morals, unlike the last three, which talked about "honor" and "respect". hilary swank is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does. movie 9, hilary swank 10!
