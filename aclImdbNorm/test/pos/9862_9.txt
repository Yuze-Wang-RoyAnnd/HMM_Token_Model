after reading some of the earlier nasty remarks, i had to put in my two cents. this show was not, despite what that goon in essex thinks, the worst thing that ever aired on tv. i think most of today's tv is much worse (when is this stupid "reality" fad ever going to end??) and there isn't a current show i can stand to watch. gimme the stuff i grew up with. i'm a 1965 baby and not ashamed to admit it.<br /><br />this show has been my all-time favorite for almost 30 years. i was in high school when it originally aired and i think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days. i was such a misfit back then, and "fantasy island" appealed to my imagination. as i was a budding writer in those days, it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft. what a wonderful premise! i won't say it didn't have its faults. sometimes the scripts were pretty bad, and some of the problems seemed trivial; but it could be good too, and it was a blast to watch and still is. as for the cheesiness factor, well, i think it's unfair to label every single 70s product as cheesy. there was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks. (btw, most of the seasons aired in the 80s!!) my favorite episodes came from seasons 2, 3 and 4 mostly.<br /><br />to those who disparage herv'e villechaize for his heavy french accent and his short stature: grow up and learn something! it's so easy to make fun when you're "normal" and "perfect". that man made the best of what he was dealt in life, and if you don't like it, that's just tough. have a little compassion. he's been dead 15 years, and how easy it is to cut down someone who can't defend himself. there's just no shame anymore.<br /><br />i love this show. so it looks dated. hate to tell you this, but we didn't have splashy special effects and blu-ray discs. we were lucky to have vcrs. live with it. accept it for what it is, and that's just plain fun. "escapist tv" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me -- an escape from my rotten real life. and it's still a lot of fun to watch.
