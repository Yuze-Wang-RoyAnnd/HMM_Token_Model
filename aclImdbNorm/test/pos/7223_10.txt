romeo and juliet had been interpreted in so many ways, but very few of the versions captured the essance of the play. the ony ones i can think of that really nail the romance's spirit were west side story and, beleive it or not, troma film's tromeo and juliet. at first glance, this is another mere splatterfest, and many would think it bastardizes the shakespearian classic. however, the film has an honest feel about it. updated to appeal to the sick-minded youth of today, of course, but not without merit. yes, the frequent dismemberments, body piercings, car crashes, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what's the harm when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation? as bad as most of the acting in this film is (i mean, it is troma, after all), the two leads have some genuine chemistry, more so than in big-budget monstrosities titanic and star wars episode two. there's a great deal of modernization, but much of the original text is in tact, especially when tromeo and juliet are together. there's a great scene where juliet utters the famous, "parting is such sweet sorrow," and tromeo quickly follows, in mid-nineties grunge fashion, "yeah, it totally sucks." i think it's truly unfortunate that this film isn't going to get the recognition or the wide release that it deserves. i hop that people who see this on the video store shelves won't be turned off by the grossmess in the movie, because they'd be missing out on quite a subversive expereience.
