i want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and i think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. it definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.<br /><br />i had heard of bruce haack but didn't know much about him, and i found the start of this documentary frustrating because i could hear other musicians talk about him, but bruce haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance. i wanted to see this bruce haack guy!! i felt as though the makers assumed i already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which i didn't, so i felt a bit left in the dark.<br /><br />when bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who bruce haack was, but it was only a taste. we got treated to more musicians and i felt as though i was being told "look - all these cool musicians are into him, so he must be cool!" i didn't really care much for the musician's commentary on bruce.<br /><br />i wanted to see bruce, as a person. you know, the important stuff - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. more about his life, and yes, his use of drugs and other issues. i would of liked to know so much more about his "hackula" project. i wanted to get inside his mind. even if they did this via some "voice of god" commentary and photos it would of been ok.<br /><br />the animations were good, but again i felt these were used as filler, they didn't really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the dimension 5 records. i did think it was clever and creative, but again... i wanted to learn more about bruce! <br /><br />maybe bruce haack was this elusive in real life?<br /><br />anyway - in the end i enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses such as mr. haack get forgotten as the march of time stamps ever onwards. i am glad that this film is around to educate people about bruce haack, even with its flaws.
