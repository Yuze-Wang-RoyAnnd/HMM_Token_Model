when i saw this film the first time i was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates. it is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974. if you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today.<br /><br />the topic of the film deals with the old question "what is real and what is illusion?". if you see "the matrix" you will find a lot of similarities. but the two films are not comparable at all because "welt am draht" is art and "the matrix" is entertainment. if prefer the first one.<br /><br />unfortunately i lost my video copy of it.<br /><br />
