i heard about this series in 2001 which a friend of mine was recording off the television each week. i never bothered to watch though i became acquainted with the series through the magazine which i looked at every now and then in bookstores. i recently purchased series one on dvd and have become addicted to this fascinating and original series. the characters at first seem unlikeable but it is amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force. as they begin to care for one another it becomes easy to care what happens to them (bearing in mind that this is only a tv series and they are fictional).<br /><br />however it isn't the pc world of star trek and so whilst every character shows a good trait they each have their own flaws and demons that they must deal with. indivual story lines mixed in with an overall multiple story-arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences i have ever had the pleasure of viewing. i absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with one another.<br /><br />this strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut john crichton and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures, being hunted by a character that wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his comrades we can easily relate to what he must be feeling. as he becomes used to his surroundings so do the viewers and his compassionate, strong-willed and brave character is a joy to watch.<br /><br />i have watched only seven episodes of farscape season one and look forward to continuing through seasons two-four and the mini-series. maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five. highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch. buy and enjoy! 10/10.
