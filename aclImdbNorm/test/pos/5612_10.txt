hal hartley entry into a european film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and, lucklily, one of the few available on dvd. at only 63 minutes running time, my only quibble would be with hartley i always leave wanting more, but never so much as this time. martin donovan is astonishing as jesus. pj harvey is beautiful and interesting as magdelena, but the high point for me was thomas jay ryan (henry fool) as satan. hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect. look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him, as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil. i have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around. if you like henry fool, martin donovan in anything (opposite of sex), and/or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as quickly as possible.
