is torture ever right? no the answer is simple and absolute with no qualifications possible. the reason as this film showed is the effect torture has on a society. the values that have been hard fought for in western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are for all men and women to be allowed to live in a free and open society. one where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their essential rights as humans. to protect this society institutions have been developed to deal with wrongdoing openly, fairly and honestly. these institutions have been adapted and honed through generations of hard work. one could argue that these are the true bedrock of democracy as they belong to us all, allow us all to be heard. if we allow undemocratic, inhumane acts to be committed in our name, if we split our society into those who have rights and those who don't then we undo the work of our ancestors. moreover we are all complicit and all guilty and tainted. whether those that we accuse are guilty or not is of no importance. we are defined by our attitudes and our responses.
