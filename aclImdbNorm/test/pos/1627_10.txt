was excited at the opening to hear part of "chevaliers de sangreal" but wanted more so i bought said hans zimmer piece. possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! this movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. you get to tour the vatican and parts of rome with excellent cinematography. the opening at cern where the "god particle" or largest quantity of antimatter is created with stunning visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. who doesn't love hanks? the storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax. this film suggests a satisfying compromise between science and religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides. "science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." a.einstein
