mark walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. when the opportunity comes for him to take over his "idol's" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. however the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... this movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it. overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, mark walhberg and jennifer aniston. it did make me feel sad, especially when emily, (jennifer aniston), met up with chris in seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk. if anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.
