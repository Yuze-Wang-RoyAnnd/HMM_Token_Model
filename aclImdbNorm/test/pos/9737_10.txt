i loved "flash gordon" as a child and watching the series again on dvd brings back such fond memories. each 15-minute episode features the adventures of our hero flash, the lovely dale arden, and intrepid dr. zarkov on the planet mongo, with flash escaping death at every turn: the shark men nearly drown him, he faces the fire monster in the tunnel of terror, and he's in mortal peril in the static room! <br /><br />the characters are still fun: buster crabbe is every bit the blonde dreamboat hero and jean rogers is a delicate and beautiful dale arden. princess aura still plots to steal flash for herself, king vultan of the hawk men still has his booming laugh and angel wings, and ming the merciless, emperor of the universe, is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps.<br /><br />this serial probably wouldn't interest children today with its hokey effects - oh, that spaceship! - but it's a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around. the actors play it straight and don't play down to kids. i appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter synopses which had pretty big words in them.<br /><br />i'm glad this came out on dvd. it's a lot of fun to revisit this classic sci-fi serial.
