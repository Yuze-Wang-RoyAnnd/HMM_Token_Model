the 80s were overrun by all those halloween/friday the 13th slasher-style horror movies, so this is something of a relief.<br /><br />ten unbelievably annoying teenagers (would you want to hang out with these jerks?!) decide to throw a halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called "hull house". during a "past life s'eance" a demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others.<br /><br />this all sounds very evil dead/demons-ish, but tenney lends some directorial style to the proceedings, there are some good one-liners, the music is excellent, the steve johnson prosthetic make-up fx are scary and linnea quigley is quite fun as a boy-crazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of lipstick!<br /><br />great fun on a no-brainer level! after checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews, i don't understand how this only received 4 out of 10 (?!)<br /><br />i give it, 8 out of 10.
