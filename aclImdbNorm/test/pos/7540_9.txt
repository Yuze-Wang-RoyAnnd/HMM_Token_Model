tremendous fun both as a film and as an excuse to sit back and play the 'oh, that's whassis name' game. every star of the golden age of english films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them. and the greatest of them all, richard wattis, was as tremendous as ever. <br /><br />there is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely, there's also some splendid jokes and comedic moments, but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it. alastair sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot, big-boned scotsman could be the headmistress of a girl's boarding school. george cole, beryl reid and irene handl all have their moments but, with alastair and richard, the star of the show is joyce grenfell. she is an absolute one-off and brings a smile whenever she's on the screen...her rolling-walk and plum accent done to perfection. <br /><br />and for those playing the , that's whassis name' game, you can even spot arthur mullard, barbara windsor and ronald searle if you look carefully.
