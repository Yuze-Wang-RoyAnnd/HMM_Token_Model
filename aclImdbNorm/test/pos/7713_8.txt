the eighth, and thus second-to-last short of the animatrix ones, this is the only one quite like this. this takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations of the matrix, and combines them unbelievably well. this is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. the animation is a gorgeous, breathtaking anim'e. the style, which is omnipresent in this, is noir. the plot is fitting, and the story-telling, as well, as the music, is spot-on. the sound in general is fantastic, and really helps solidify the mood and atmosphere, along with the drawings and designs. the voice acting is impeccable. this is one of only two where people also in the movies reprise their roles, and both have anne-moss, who is the only of them appearing in this. this is one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. this is about ten minutes long. the pacing is perfect. it never slows down terribly much, but it's not overwhelming, either. the ending could not have been more appropriate for this. this shares a nine and a half-minutes long making of with kid's story, and it's well-done and informative. i recommend this warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of. 8/10
