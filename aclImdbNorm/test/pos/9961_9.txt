the merchant of venice is a fantastic movie. it's very true to the original shakespeare play. if you saw jeremy irons in casanova and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! if you saw joseph fiennes in shakespeare in love and you enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! if you saw al pacino in donnie brasco and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! it is a very enjoyable movie and if you're studying shakespeare like me, this is a great movie to see!! the only problem with this movie is that you can't let the little ones see it because is has a wee bit of nudity in it. but other than that, it's a really good movie!!
