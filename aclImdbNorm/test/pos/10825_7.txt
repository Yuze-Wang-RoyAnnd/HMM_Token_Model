an interesting pairing of stories, this little flick manages to bring together seemingly different characters and story lines all in the backdrop of wwii and succeeds in tying them together without losing the audience. i was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how much i really felt i understood them and their motivations, even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited. the outstanding acting abilities of the individuals involved with this picture are easily noted. a fun, stylized movie with a slew of comic moments and a bunch more head shaking events.<br /><br />7/10
