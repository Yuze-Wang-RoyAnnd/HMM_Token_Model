i haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. i was busting for the loo; and i didn't even want to pause it because i was drawn right in. emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. it gives you an amazing insight to south africa; their struggles and their lives. the acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; i was captivated. i don't want to even try and explain the story; it's way too complex and i wouldn't do it justice. please see this; you'll understand why when you do. cheers, hol
