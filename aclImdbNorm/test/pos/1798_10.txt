happy 25th birthday to valley girl! great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances...captures the spirit of the 80's; the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts. a wonderful rendition of high school life and "gritty downtown" from a suburban perspective.<br /><br />the soundtrack contains songs by modern english, felony, josie cotton, sparks, payola$, josie cotton, the plimsouls, the psychedelic furs, men at work, the flirts and bananarama.<br /><br />this movie truly is romeo and juliet (minus the double suicide) set in 1980's los angeles. julie's dad, played by frederic forrest (sonny bono, anyone?) is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how he sprung such a materialistic offspring. yet, he doesn't judge, ya dig??
