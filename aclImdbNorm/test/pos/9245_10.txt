nice doco stuie! <br /><br />even though it didn't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewing.<br /><br />it is self evident how much you put into it.<br /><br />that goes for everyone else too. it's great to see the warts and all account of the process without being 'too nice'.<br /><br />loved it! well worth a view.<br /><br />que pena, the writer of 'the original' film couldn't appreciate what you have achieved.<br /><br />love the attitude too. great piece. looking forward to seeing the next work.<br /><br />keep going bro! paully
