picture the scene: a bored student with an empty day ahead, a video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week rentals. this ex-student usually just grabbed a pile of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary of reasons (the turning anybody?). occasionally the odd undiscovered gem did make it into his vcr - this being the case with this film. everything about the film is good, but much more than this the parts all mesh to provide something all too rare - a cracking good film. why this never got a uk cinema release is beyond me, especially when we consider the crap that we have to wade through at the multiplex week on week. whilst i'll happily accept this isn't oscar material (but neither was sodding titanic - schmaltzy cgi-tinged bollocks) it is a an extremely enjoyable film. i was trying to think of a way to describe how best this film should be appreciated/accepted - the perfect film to watch while bonding with your dad, after a coming home for the holidays, after a large sunday lunch.
