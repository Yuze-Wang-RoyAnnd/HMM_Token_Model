this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected. of course it's sappy, of course it's predictable. we all know the fairytale. but knowing that when you go to watch it, it's enjoyable enough to watch. it was funny and sweet. i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t-shirts about math. i was an outcast in high school and i didn't do these things. it goes much deeper than that. having to do with many things, some of that being how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids. anyway, i won't get into it. i don't agree with other opinions that drew isn't convincing as a geek. with braces, no make-up and unwashed hair, i don't think too many people would be drooling over her. and even when she goes back to high-school and sheds those things. she's still wearing the "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to be considered cool. and her other "geek" friend may be beautiful but it doesn't matter, where i come from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful.
