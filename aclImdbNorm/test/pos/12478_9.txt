what do you get when you have a tenacious, seasoned french police inspector by the name of maurice martineau is called to solve a murder case? well, simply a very entertaining, fun film. the re-mastered black-and-white film "quai des orfevres" delivers the goods despite romance, jealousy and marriage that seem to just get in the way towards the truth of 'who done it?'<br /><br />inch by inch, technique by technique as seasoned by experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector etches into the truth -- but of course, with the help of a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks.<br /><br />martineau is the centerpiece of this film. the use by director henri-georges clouzot of raucous background music to intensify the drama in grand film noir style is a wonderful wrapper around the visual experience.<br /><br />martineau eventually solves the mystery and arrests the culprit. hey, he is good!! but alas, martineau, too, can keep a dark secret in his past. who is that boy that is perhaps not his son?<br /><br />some things can never get solved -- even beyond the closing credits.
