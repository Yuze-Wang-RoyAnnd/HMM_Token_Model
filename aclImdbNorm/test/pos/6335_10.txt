the creepy demons "the gentlemen" capture the voice of the population of sunnydale, to steal human hearts without scream. giles find that in accordance with a legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but buffy and her friends, including riley, have to fight the monsters speechless.<br /><br />"hush" is certainly the best episode of the fourth season of buffy up to this moment. having lots of humor and funny situations, i liked a lot. spike is hilarious, the romance between xander and anya is cool, but i loved the "intense" dialog between buffy and riley in end. the gothic scenario of the final battle against "the gentlemen" recalls the environment of "dark city". my vote is ten.<br /><br />title (brazil): "sil^encio" ("silence")
