"sharky's machine" is clearly a burt reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to strut his talents and he spray-paints the machine, the film plot, with colors from other films and other styles, offering a variety of moods within a nourish story.<br /><br />made in 1981 at 119 minutes (lengthy for the time period), the film did well, with box office grosses at $37,800,000. it had a lot going for it: burt reynolds actor and director, a solid one-two punch; a william diel novel adaptation, and the south land of atlanta georgia, at this time, a land of opportunity for film production out of hollywood.<br /><br />reynolds' tom sharky falling in love with rachel ward's dominoe the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold is here echoed as it was in "hustle" when he played opposite catherine deneuve, and that film also had a corrupt politician at its core, but with downbeat ending not the hollywood happiness in "sharky's machine".<br /><br />the story is pure detective procedure/actioner. sharky a narcotics detective mismanages up a bust of a drug dealer, causing the killing of some innocent bystanders, and gets demoted, literally transferred downstairs to vice, to deal with perverts, and other m misdemeanors that 'upstanding' cops consider latrine duty. his new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants. when some attention is pointed toward a certain pimp sharky looks over some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute dominoe (rachel ward) - dominoe is being shielded by police forces and political forces and sharky sets himself up a 24-hour surveillance force to watch her. during the time he watches he learns that the current governor-elect hotchkins (earl holliman) is visiting dominoe, as is a slick italian gangster victor (vittorio gassman). before the police can build a case with the evidence, billy, victor's brother, a coke-snorting gunman (henry silva) shoots through the door of dominoe's apartment seemingly killing the beautiful dominoe, but when sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate tiffany (aarika wells) sharky confronts victor and tells him that he is going to have him arrested. sharky is captured by some ninja killers lead by smiley (darryl hickman) and is tortured for information to lead to dominoe, but sharky overpowers them and arrests the governor and in a heated chase kills billy after he has killed victor.<br /><br />reynolds wants to exhibit the inner workings of a hardened policemen falling in love, but the police-story plot, flavored with noir element, and reynolds ability at cinematic development tends to slick over the dynamics of the relationships.<br /><br />we come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working towards their pensions in vice, instead of fighting real crime- this element of the film seems sketchy under reynolds' off-handed direction and performance.<br /><br />there is always uniqueness to a reynolds film. he likes to hire stars, either character actors or others and then allow them to improvise, sometimes with varying results.<br /><br />with his crew in "sharky's machine" he gets some fine moments, and sometimes some overblown grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and good-natured-ness. with reynolds as auteur it works.<br /><br />reynolds, the actor/auteur always seems to be smirking at himself and the viewer as if to say it's all fake, but good fun.<br /><br />great line: in the scene with victor when sharky throws down the gauntlet "you're walkin' all over people like you own 'em ,and you wanna know the worst part? you're from out of state." this seems to be the greatest insult the officer can throw at a criminal.<br /><br />reynolds made the film in atlanta at his career point have shot himself reading the phone book and would have surely targeted and demographic.<br /><br />the film did mark the appearance of rachel ward who was nominated as new star of the year in 1981 by the golden globe.<br /><br />reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make films close to home, georgia.<br /><br />i got my dvd from half.com for $7.99 and unfortunately it doesn't contain any commentary or making-of features, which is a shame. maybe the next generation will have them.<br /><br />the movie is still a lot of fun and both reynolds and ward are great-looking actors in their prime.
