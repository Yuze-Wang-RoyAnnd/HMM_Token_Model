this small john ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. it has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey west of a party of mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all ford's films, (it's on par with "the sun shines bright" which he made a couple of years later).<br /><br />there is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental. the splendid performances of ford's stock company, (ben johnson, harry carey jr, ward bond, jane darwell etc), adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full-bodied star performance is joanne dru's denver. dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were bond and johnson, who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an oscar for his work in "the last picture show". as he said himself, 'it couldn't have happened to a nicer fella'. add bert glennon's superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than ford. this is a film that truly honors america's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling.
