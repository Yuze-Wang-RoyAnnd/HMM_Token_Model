i am 13 years old and i am writing this review in my mom's sign in. she will write her own review later. <br /><br />this is my all time favorite movie.it was filmed in england in 1944. i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape. i love this movie and it changed my life! the beautiful landscapes. the mighty pie-bold thoroughbred horse. the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done, compete in the grand national steeplechase in london with her most beloved horse, the pirate. it all made me want to ride horses (which i have done now for 7 years)and learn everything i could about their breeds so i could also draw and paint them. it's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds, overcoming your fears, believing in yourself, and reaching difficult goals by working very hard. also, the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and i have seen many movies with horse races. i never get tired of watching this movie. everything about it is perfect. especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!
