we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age, with the likes of the four feathers (1939) and zulu, simply because the imperial age was, for the most part, british. here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age.<br /><br />america's projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of "native" peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.) what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history.<br /><br />though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be sean connery's noble brigand, candace bergen's feisty heroine, john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, roosevelt's "big stick". there is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed. this is high adventure at its best.
