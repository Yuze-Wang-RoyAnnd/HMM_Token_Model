this movie is hilarious. i would say much more painful & disgusting than the previous movie. the entire cast from the previous movie & series is present.<br /><br />these kind of movies are great to watch in the movietheater cause the whole audience is crying with laughter, especially at the terrorist part that was damn disgusting. i wish they made more of these kind of movies.<br /><br />strong stomach required! they got some insane stunts this time around. warning: includes a lot of snakes! i would love to write about it but i just can't spoil the fun. go see it!!!
