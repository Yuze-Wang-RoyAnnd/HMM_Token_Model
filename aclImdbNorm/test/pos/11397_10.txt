boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90's and i'd go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top 250. i can actually understand why many would dislike it, due to the subject matter. i personally feel however as many do, judging from the aclaim this film's received by viewers and critics that it's topnotch film making.<br /><br />the direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance.there is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing. the individual characters reach out and touch you. given that this is a movie about the porn industry, one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are. the direction is among the best i've ever seen-and i've seen a lot of films.<br /><br />the film isn't about one particular personal individual's story, it's about many.it's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them. boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning, and though the film is long(i believe almost 3 hours) you honestly don't even notice. and when it ends you kind of don't want it to....<br /><br />i'm not easy to impress, meaning there aren't many movies i'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one. beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. i have never, in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie.there was such flawlessness to it, you know it's not something your gonna see everyday.<br /><br />burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best i've ever seen him do, and mark wahlberg is incredible(i'm astounded there are still people saying he doesn't act well. i don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that)but the person who really surprised me was heather grahem(rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the limo, towards the end.<br /><br />again, i'll echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody. but i still think this was topnotch.10 of 10.
