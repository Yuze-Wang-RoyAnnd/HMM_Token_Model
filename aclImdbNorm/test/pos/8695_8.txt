this film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a hollywood blockbuster. as i recall (and it's a few years since i've seen the film) the action starts with a london omnibus filled with people. there is an horrific crash and one passenger dies. the rest of the film is then told in flashback, with 13 characters who were on the bus getting their recent lives explored in intricate detail. at the end of the film we return to the crash and find out which of these chirpy, vivid characters has met a gruesome end. great stuff, a little like a good tabloid news story fleshed out in precise, even handed detail. if only it were available on video...
