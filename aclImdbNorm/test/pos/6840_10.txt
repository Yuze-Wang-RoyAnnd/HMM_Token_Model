in the dvd era, you would think you could find pretty much any piece of crap committed to celluloid and for the most part, it's true. so why, why is it so hard to find this great little flick, clearly done by people who love noir as a loving homage (buit never descending into spoof land) of that most cinematic of genres. emma thompson and alan rickman are a hoot in this and superstar-in-the-making carla gugino (karen sisco, sin city) does her now trademark red hot babe/great acting routine. <br /><br />this movie really has it all for fans of film. a b noir on steroids, the clever and steamy judas kiss succeeds on every count.<br /><br />please columbia tristar please release it on dvd soon!!!!!!
