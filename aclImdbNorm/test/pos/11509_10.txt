the movie is about paul(p'all) a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital "kleppur" and his friends. victor(viktor) who during his education in england started to think he was adolf hitler. peter(p'etur) who took to much lsd and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity, he is obbsesed with china. oli beatle ('oli b'itill) oli has spent most time at the hospital although viktor is slightly older then him, he claims he wrote every single beatles song and send it to them by telepathy<br /><br />the novel is better then the movie and covers all of pauls life from birth to his death, there is a long time since i saw the movie but if i remember it right the movie doesn't cover pauls childhood.<br /><br />"englar alheimsins" is funny,sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it now! and read the novel first it makes the movie better
