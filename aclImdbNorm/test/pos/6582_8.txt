imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience: grey instead of white, no snow fights and certainly no wonderlands. this is the finland as portrayed by 'frozen land'. this film follows a bunch of people whose lives are oddly linked to each others' with results beyond anyone's nightmares. yes, most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can - completely annoying and frustrating to watch, yet for some reason you wish for their luck to turn. <br /><br />with some randomly placed humour and a cast that groups together finland's somewhat mainstream faces, frozen land offers a glimpse of the finnish mentality that despite its depressing downward spirals manages to restore some faith in humanity. more so than kaurism"aki, to say the least.
