ich will danke herr hacke f"ur den filme. mein deutsch ist nicht gut. enschuldigen sie.<br /><br />first of all, i didn't know how diverse the sound of istanbul, inspite i live in turkey.faith akin and alexander hacke have made a different approach for turkish music.narrating, performing, seeing istanbul and istanbul music from a foreigner aspect had given the real meaning of the music itself.<br /><br />in this movie i had found out how different our(turkish) culture is, how interesting our performers are, and how much respect they deserve. unfortunately no one have been able to serve this kind of documentary before.
