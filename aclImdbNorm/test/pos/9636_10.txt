this is another classic seagal movie. he walks, no, cruises through the patriot just all the other mega seagal movies. nothing even comes close to challenging seagal in this movie except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so called 'plague' and he starts throwing things about the lab but it all works out, i mean lets face it, its master seagal, he's got to win. what about his outfit in the film, masterpiece, he must have picked it himself. its great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus but seagal doesn't even get a cough. the incident at the end when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass, genius, i bet seagal thought of that one as well. this film is class pure and simple. great plot, great characters, and seagal.
