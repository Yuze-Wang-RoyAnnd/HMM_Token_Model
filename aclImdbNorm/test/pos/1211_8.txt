in the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. hulk hogan would take on roddy piper, or bobby heenan's cronies or ted dibiase and come out victorious more often than not. occasionally he would get an ally like randy savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about hulk hogan vs bobby heenan, and that's the way it should be.<br /><br />but on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the wwe thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. it didn't work out. but the wwe was right about one thing: hulkamania was finished and a new order needed to be established.<br /><br />this historic wrestlemania, the first to be held outside america, kicked off with rick martel defeating koko b ware. koko never really had a lot of luck at wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here.<br /><br />next up the colossal connection andre the giant and haku put their tag team titles on the line against demolition ax and smash and lost. new tag team champions crowned.<br /><br />next match saw earthquake defeat hercules. hercules was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at wrestlemania. plenty of luck for brutus beefcake as he ended mr perfect's undefeated streak. well, i guess someone had to end it.<br /><br />roddy piper and bad news brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match, next up the hart foundation defeated nikolai volkov and boris zhukov in 19 seconds. not really a match, unfortunately. the barbarian then defeated tito santana in a short match.<br /><br />the american dream dusty rhodes and saphire then defeated the macho king randy savage and queen sherri in a messy mixed tag match. this was the only female wrestling really going on in the wwe at this point of time.<br /><br />next up was a fun match as the rockers marty janetty and shawn micheals defeated the orient express in a fast paced encounter. there were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time. jim duggan then beat dino bravo in a nothing match.<br /><br />next ted dibiase put his most cherished possession, the million dollar championship on the line against jake roberts. roberts was distracted by virgil and counted out allowing ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show.<br /><br />next up the twin towers collide as the big bossman defeats akeem in short order, this is followed by rick rude winning a short match with jimmy snuka.<br /><br />finally we come to the main event with hulk hogan putting the wwe title on the line against intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior. this is an entertaining back and forth match won by the warrior after hogan missed a leg drop. the crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle.<br /><br />and so the torch was passed, but would the ultimate warrior prove to be the champion the wwe hoped he would be?
