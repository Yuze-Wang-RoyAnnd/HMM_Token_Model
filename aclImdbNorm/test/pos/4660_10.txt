weee this is still jolly good fun! as with most of my friends, we had seen this movie on hbo when we were young, and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it. when they finally rereleased it a few years ago, we had a midnight madness party... and the movie held up well. sure, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. if you didn't see mm when you were young, you might not appreciate its value today.
