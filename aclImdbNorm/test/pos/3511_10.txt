i first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network t.v. i think i was like 9.(picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). anyway, i've seen it again years later and it's like i remembered,it's really good,scary flick. i think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. friday the 13th. but it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better. even though this is a killer in the woods flick like friday,it has more in common with the original texas chainsaw massacre.that's because the movie lays down a certain atmosphere and feeling of dread,even in broad daylight. and the killers feel more threatening than in friday. there's also a good amount of suspense. i recommend seeing it now that it's being released on dvd in late july.
