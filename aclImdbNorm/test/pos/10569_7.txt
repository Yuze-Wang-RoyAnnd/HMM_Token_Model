historical drama is one of the areas where the british just can't be beat. so while i'm not a huge fan of the genre, i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's british and with decent actors.<br /><br />i have never read anything by sarah waters, which is of course something i should do. hence i didn't really know what to expect from this. i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated. without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well-crafted. although there were almost a twist too many somewhere, it took me a minute to get everything straight.<br /><br />production values are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half-hour. that might just be me though, i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished. all in all though, this is a fairly enjoyable three hours. i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
