just saw this movie 2 days ago. a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. i have no special interest in wine, and yet i found this very enlightening. the director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. while he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer. he shows a lot of compassion to people (and dogs) and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell.<br /><br />the movie shows us where our world is going to, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big, personal and global, character and formula.<br /><br />the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves.<br /><br />it takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing, but it's worth it.<br /><br />highly recommended.
