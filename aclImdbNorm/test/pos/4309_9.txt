if you haven't seen this film, do it. its a genremix as i've never seen another. some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (the 2nd best played orgasm on film, bested only by sally), a pitch of orson welles blended together into a work of art. as an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). i owned an tv copy on vhs but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back. but the film should be out on dvd in austria on 10.06.03 and be sure, i will buy it.
