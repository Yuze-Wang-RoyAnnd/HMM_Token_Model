wish it would be released, as i would love to see the finished product! we saw the unfinished version before it came out. loved all the characters and actors. anyone know if it is out on video yet? would love to see it again.definitely worth renting if it's not going to be shown in the theatre. i had a hard time finding it because they renamed it.
