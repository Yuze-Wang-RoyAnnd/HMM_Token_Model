as everyone knows by now, 15 park avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister.<br /><br />the manifestation of schizophrenia is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored. there are also those, who, however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film, think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence. i think ms. sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 park avenue". she has done a good turn, not only to the general public, but also to those who deal with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psycho-analysts. the film actually helps in dispelling a lot of myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. i'm told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her, who suffers from this mental affliction. to that effect, i'm sure that none of what has been shown, is blown out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of facts.<br /><br />the performances are good, on the whole, as can be expected. konkona sen sharma, shabana azmi and of course rahul bose, are very good indeed. they emerge as very "real" characters ... credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times. people may think me terribly queer, but i think there are moments when one can identify with meethi as well! i suppose all of us have a streak of "insanity" inside us .... perhaps some more than others. these are the people who are singled out. after all, don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? impossible ones, at times? would we be dubbed as being "off our rockers" if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds? would a person with low self-esteem, be considered a schizophrenic because he/she shuns company ... preferring instead to live in a world of his/her own because that's the only space where there is a sense of security?<br /><br />konkona, as meethi, is outstanding!! her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part. she has shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting! a case in point is the part where she's distressed at the scene, shown on tv, of saddam hussein's arrest. her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ...as if she's really heart-broken at this tragedy! her brand of indian english too, is so spontaneous and natural. <br /><br />however, the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors. kanwaljeet and waheeda rehman, splendid actors both, seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in english. their diction is less than perfect ... stilted and affected, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent. their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the tale.<br /><br />the brutal rape of meethi (konkona), seems somewhat unnecessary. any other incident would have sufficed just as well, i feel. the point here is that something triggers off the extreme manifestation of the illness. as the psychiatrist explains, one cannot, with any modicum of conviction or certainty, say that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia, to the fore. then why are we subjected to the scene where meethi lies bleeding and unconscious. was ms. sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power?? if so, then the scene of the rape is warranted but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film.<br /><br />the ending seems somewhat abrupt. is the audience expected to find a solution? where does meethi disappear to? does ms. sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and hence credible, holds true? in other words, is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity? i'm not very sure.<br /><br />a thought-provoking film on the whole and well worth watching. however, if you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... everything cut and dried, with a water-tight solution to each issue that comes up ... this film is clearly not meant for you!
