it's fun and fast paced, as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable, surprising conclusion. the suspense separates this holiday flick from all others. one wonders how the pieces are going to fit, both during the movie and in the future.<br /><br />the character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. sinkewicz (frank jenks) shows us what manipulation can get...and ultimately what manipulation can cost! uncle felix (s.z. sakall) sizes up each person for us while trying to protect "lishka" (barbara stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end.<br /><br />if we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these.<br /><br />a glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed uncle felix's watch. i've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store.<br /><br />watch it, and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere!
