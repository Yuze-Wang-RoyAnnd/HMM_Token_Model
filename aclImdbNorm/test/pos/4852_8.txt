this is a movie about a man everybody thinks is jewish.this is a movie about lawrence newman, who lives in brooklyn in the 1940's, at the time of wwii.one day, when he gets himself glasses, people start thinking he's a jew.and that only, because he looks like one.and he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood.so some people start treating him like dirt.they make that judgment, being a jew, of larry's fresh wife, gertrude hart, too.that makes their lives unbearable.neal slavin's focus (2001) is a fairly good look at the antisemitism.that's a problem that won't go away.the movie is based on athur miller's novel, which, i admit, i haven't read.but the movie is really good, so i'm sure the book would also.the actors do good job.william h.macy is always good, and his work as larry newman is brilliant.laura dern is gert hart and she's magnificent.meat loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep jews out by any means necessary.david paymer's character as the jewish shop-owner mr. finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie.paymer is the perfect choice for the role.one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr.finkelstein and newman fight against those nazi-like people with baseball bats.they join together to fight the evil.the christian and the jew.
