the most "spiritual" film i have seen in a long long time. maybe ever. also one scene around the dining room table a piece of comic perfection. i understand a release date is coming up in the fall. if it comes to your town and you want to see a movie that makes you think this is it. aviva is great in it and she is most certainly a future star - (superbad is out now which she is in) - also all the actors seem perfectly calibrated. there is a tone set by this movie that is used to surprise through out. i would not know what to call it - it is comedy but the undergirding message is so fierce and direct that "comedy" is not a big enough word for it. i love this film. it is a thinking man's comedy. but even that phrase is not really good enough. ftf does have a message and that message needs to be heard right now
