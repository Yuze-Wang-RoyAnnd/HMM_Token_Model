this is one of the classic twilight zone episodes, where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable. five figures are inside a container/prison: a major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown, and a tramp. they are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nevertheless) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. what have they in common? none can figure it out. but gradually the major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders. and the major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and .... i'll leave it like that, although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away.<br /><br />the title seems to be suggested by six characters in search of an author, pirandello's famous play. whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable: pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relations with each other. but the five characters here, while they try to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in pirandello who know their current situations. this uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.<br /><br />the actors, william windon as the major and murray mattheson as the clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. and the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.
