this is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a sicilian farm, the boat,and ellis island new york. all shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. i wonder if this was to save money? no street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. and the music...what on earth was going on with playing nina simone songs, decades before they were out? i could have done without the milk river business too......but hey, before you think of me as a pure misanthrope, let me repeat, this is a very good film, with heartbreakng moments, wonderful photography, great characters and more accuracy than the usual (american) efforts at the immigration experience.
