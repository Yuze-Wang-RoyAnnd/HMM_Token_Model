i am a christian, and thought this movie was pretty good! :) while the acting wasn't academy award caliber, i thought it was good, considering the cast has had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made.<br /><br />the gospel message and the transforming power of jesus christ was explained wonderfully. the message that the director was trying to get across (which is the important thing, not how the characters dressed!) definitely got through. the theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was a good idea, too (cool muscle cars, btw). i think this movie will definitely reach out to a lot of young people.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend this movie, it is a great witnessing tool! :)
