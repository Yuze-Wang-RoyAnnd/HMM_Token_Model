'hitch' is a nice surprise: a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic. 'hitch' takes actors like will smith, kevin james, and eva mendes into a fun, light-as-a-feather journey that actually had me laughing and, yes, a little "aww, how sweet!".<br /><br />meet alex hitchens (will smith), aka hitch. he's a self-proclaimed 'date doctor'; he helps hopeless guys like albert (kevin james) win guys like allegra (amber valletta). unfortunately, hitch has to deal with sarah (eva mendes), a gossip columnist bent on breaking the date doctor...<br /><br />'hitch' is actually pretty funny, and it even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun. i have to wonder why will smith hasn't made more movies like this. his sharp, rapid-fire delivery is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with mendes and james is wonderful. james is a real discovery; i have never seen his show 'the king of queens', but he is funny and heartfelt, and he proves once more that fat white men cannot dance hip-hop (smith's responses to his attempts are hilarious). mendes is hot and bouncy (not that way, geez) as smith's perfect match, and amber valletta is sweet as allegra.<br /><br />'hitch' isn't perfect; it's a tad too long, and things get too "dramatic" near the end (although this is redeemed by the happy ending filled with funny dancing). but's it a great refresher from the cookie-cutter romantic comedies that keep littering theaters.
