i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film. seriously, i couldn't find anything wrong with it. one definite plus is how it was filmed. set in morrocco in 1904, the wind and the lion is filled with stirring images like the great raisuli on horseback especially. the cinematography was faultless, the editing was crisp, the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking. and i have to mention the music from jerry goldsmith, it was phenomenal. i have used this phrase a lot recently, but goldsmith ain't my favourite film composer for nothing. his score here is so rousing and exciting, it shows the man's true musical genius, and this gem of a score should be up there with goldsmith's best scores with legend, rambo:first blood, patton and the secret of nimh.<br /><br />the action is exhilarating and the screenplay is intelligent and sophisticated. the direction is sensitively handled too. the performances were astounding as well, with sean connery, ever the picture of charisma and suavity, magnificent as the great raisuli, he almost dominates the entire picture on his own. he is joined by a feisty candice bergen, a wily john huston and a captivating brian keith in one of his more understated performances. the history is fairly accurate, perhaps flimsy in some areas, but with the acting, music and visuals so good i am past caring. 10/10 bethany cox
