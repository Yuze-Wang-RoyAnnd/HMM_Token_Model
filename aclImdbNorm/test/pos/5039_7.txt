angels are a bit of an american obsession, but are often rather boring. they are the messengers of god, and also the arc angels are great warriors (lucifer being the toughest and best looking until he was kicked out of heaven).<br /><br />so what happens if you don't believe in anything, let alone angels and you are sent to investigate an angel story, only to meet one with wings and less than angelic attitude.<br /><br />maybe that is what america needs, being a puritan is different from being good. michael is a rude, obnoxious, womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes, and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched.<br /><br />funny, but not greatly so, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever...it is just a good simple, small comedy. watch on a lazy sunday afternoon.
