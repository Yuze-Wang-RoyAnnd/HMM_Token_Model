you looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast? well locate this little sleeper. john lithgow and billy bob thorton are great in this little plot twister. don't forget the cameo by jamie lee curtis. a touch of the 60's, a touch of "the prince and the pauper", and dash of that homegrown gold makes for a greast little story.
