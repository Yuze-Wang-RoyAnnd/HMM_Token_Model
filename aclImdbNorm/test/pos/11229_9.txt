it's a shame this movie is rated pg 13--it is really quite suitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well.<br /><br />it belongs to that wonderful genre of serio-comic ghost/angel stories that would have to include everything from capra's "it's a wonderful life" to wenders's "wings of desire." <br /><br />the photography is stunning, the acting first rate, and--wonder of wonders--the tone is uplifting.<br /><br />my only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. the two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste. as the director points out in his commentary on the dvd, all the ingredients of irwin's story are on his bedside table. the symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me.<br /><br />but what a lark! my favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner. this is practically theatrical in its magic--a tour de force of witty acting--subtle, playful, and positively rhythmic--coupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesque.<br /><br />"northfork" is funny, touching, gorgeous to look at, magical (with the above reservations) and has not one single car-chase.<br /><br />an easy nine stars.
