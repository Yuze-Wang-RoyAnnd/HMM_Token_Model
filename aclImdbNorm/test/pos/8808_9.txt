i remember a time when the only thing that did exist where clubs, drugs pubs and parties. this movie came out a couple of years after i started going clubbing. if i had never discovered the ravier side of things this movie may not have made sense to me. that night when i watched it for the 1st time, with some mates, i was completely blown away. i had never watched a movie that hit so close to the reality of where i was in my life at that time. almost everything i could relate to in some way. there was never 1 character i could fully relate to but more a combination of all of them in one way or another. my mates where no different and i remember us all saying that they where us or we where them. we had all been out that weekend together doing exactly what the crew do in ht. we where coming down while we watched and when the movie "came down" i remember actually coming down a bit further. it was actually quite depressing in our room during those "low points". thats what's so good about human traffic. it really taps the whole situation.<br /><br />its a unique movie in the way its not plot driven, but then its not completely character driven although the characters are important. it always seemed to be based on the situations. situations as a group and as individuals. each character is lost in life, for their own reasons. yet each of them responds to the lostness in the same way. work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all. for them its their holiday. but the reality is you cant truly escape. another situation they all have to face.<br /><br />me and my mates where no different from these guys. we all had our own stuff going on. human traffic helped explain to us what we didn't understand about our selves. it does it in a way that doesn't talk down to you. it made us feel like we weren't the only ones out there like us and that the lessons learned where ones many others, from all over the world, had gone thru. it wasn't until my lifestyle changed from party popper to career driven that i would fully understand this movie. these days i watch ht, every now and then(as i just have), and reminisce the old days. no other movie can do this. i was peter popper, i was jip travolta, i went to never never land with my chosen family. i'd have $200 in my back burner and i wax the lot! no worries!
