the bbc's blue planet is simply jaw-dropping. i don't think i'm exaggerating when i say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film. from familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognisable and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths, next to nothing is left out. weighing in at a hefty 8 hours, some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film "deep blue" but i would heartily recommend you give the series a go. i don't think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the aquatic world brought to them by pixar's finding nemo i'm sure they will love this too. i just wish all television was this entertaining.
