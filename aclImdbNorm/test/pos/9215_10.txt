the worst movie ever?? hardly!!! this is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen! it has appearances from all the great characters from the animated tv series rainbow brite. very safe for small children and the colors capture their attention like no other! there is an evil princess trying to steal the diamond planet spectra, which would in turn cause all life on earth to cease. this tells the tale of how rainbow brite and her new friend krys are able to stop the princess' evil plot and restore life and color back to earth. it's proof that kids can make a difference! rainbow brite will live on forever.
