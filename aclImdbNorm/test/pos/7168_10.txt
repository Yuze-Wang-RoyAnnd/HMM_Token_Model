my first mamin film, saw it on ifc long ago, and loved it. it seemed absolutely artistic, original, fun and hilarious. not a moment in the film let me down or made me bored, and i was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face. i mean this movie is truly funny. but here's the catch: it's also very artistic and creative - if you don't know yuri mamin (probably, sadly, because so many of his great films aren't available here) he has a very original style like no one else's, and for me this isn't even my favorite film of his (right now it's the insane ("saideburns/bakenbardy"). also, i have to say as a russian, this film is great because you really do see what russians are like. and this is possible because this is a true russian film to me, not a foreign film trying to be american or trying to appeal; mamin did not sell out (nor has he since, gorko (1998) was as good if not better. this is true russian style filmaking that came out of communist social realism.<br /><br />if you liked this film, i think you have a very high chance of loving mamin's other films, in fact i like quite a few of them more than this one. i guess this one is his most accessible film. a similar film is fountain, taking place 6 years before during perestroika, it has the same actor in the leading role, and more of mamin's regulars who you will recognize from window to paris; this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy, a great one. viva mamin, hopefully criterion will hook all of his movies up one day, he's still working, and his catalog is so great! see any of his films if you can.
