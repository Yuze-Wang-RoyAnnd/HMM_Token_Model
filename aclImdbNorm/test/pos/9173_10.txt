i just wish i was eloquent enough to say how good this movie is.<br /><br />i...it's hard to say.<br /><br />maybe i'll just say what comes to mind.<br /><br />i laughed. i really laughed. i couldn't believe it. i laughed, and, it wasn't bitter-laughter. it wasn't cynical laughter. it was the laughter that is generated by genuine joy.<br /><br />joy. that's a foreign word for me. i don't feel that word often, but, i did while watching this movie.<br /><br />will. maybe it's will's face. he is a great human being. "smile on my face and there's a twinkle in my eye." that line in one of will's songs describes him perfectly. he has "joie de vivre". trey is a lucky, lucky boy to have a daddy like will. jada is a lucky, lucky woman to have a husband like will. he is someone...special.<br /><br />happy. i actually feel happy. it's a strange feeling. i don't feel this way very often. it's just so nice to see, to see...other people really happy. i mean really happy. in this movie, i did. as will says in the movie, "maybe i'm not happy with just 'fine', maybe i want 'extraordinary." you know, watching this movie made me think: so do i.<br /><br />fun. being yourself. we all know we're supposed to be ourselves, but, it feels like we're punished if we do so. maybe it has to be earned. maybe it's something that we show after having not been ourselves for a long time. that's why i just loved the ending. will, eva mendes, kevin james, amber valleta, julie ann emery all dancing at the wedding. dancing without inhibitions. no they we're not drunk! except, on actually being happy. i can understand that, at least, i think i can (at least, i enjoyed seeing them happy, really happy).<br /><br />women and men. i don't know anything about relationships, but, i do feel. watching this movie i feel like connecting with someone, striving, pushing, wanting to be with someone. it seems to make life...something else entirely. i don't really know. i'm just guessing. but, i felt something, watching this movie. i felt like, that connection, must be...must make, life worthwhile.<br /><br />that's the kind of movie this is. it's funny. it's clever. it's tender. it evokes feeling. it made me think, that maybe, just maybe, life is, truly is, a wonderful thing.<br /><br />want to laugh? want to feel really good! want to get some answers about girls (and girls, answers about guys)? watch hitch. you-will-get-it-all!!!<br /><br />go will!!! you are a great human being.
