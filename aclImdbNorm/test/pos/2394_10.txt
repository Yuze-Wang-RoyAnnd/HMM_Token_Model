i loved this film, independent film-making at its best. the cinematography , pacing, rhythm , and acting were perfectly in sync. fred carpenters best work to date! the movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending. it moves well and keeps you involved. being a photographer, i was most impressed with the cinematography. the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film. this gave the actors a great canvas to start from, to work their magic. and that is just what they did! great performances from all the actors and each one was well cast in their roles. as i said in the beginning, the is a wonderful film, and one of fred carpenters best movies. you will love it.
