or if you've seen the "evil dead" trilogy and/or "bubba ho-tep", then you should know that his movies are total farces. with "man with the screaming brain", he goes all out again. in this case, he plays smarmy american businessman william cole visiting bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country? - when a woman kills him. so, strange scientist ivan ivanov (stacy keach) replaces half of cole's brain with the brain of a former kgb agent, leaving him acting sort of like steve martin in "all of me".<br /><br />yes, the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense. much of the real humor comes from "evil dead" director sam raimi's brother ted as ivanov's nearly brain-dead assistant pavel. the two men have a relationship more like laurel and hardy or gilligan and the skipper.<br /><br />so just understand that this is a totally silly movie, and you won't be a bit disappointed. i liked it, anyway.
