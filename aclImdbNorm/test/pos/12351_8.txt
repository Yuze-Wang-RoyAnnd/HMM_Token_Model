multiply named and strangely casted, "one dark night" aka "mausoleum", is one of the better early horror video-rentals. original and quite raw, we meet adam west briefly in this film about telekinesis and teen-age headgames. meg tilly is dared into spending the night in a crypt by "the sisters" a high-school gang of hair-hoppers in blue satin jackets. the initiation is interrupted by the recently interred body of a mass-murdering psychic wizard called "raymar". surprisingly awesome make-up and scare effects paints this chiller film with style and deliver a heart-pounding climax.
