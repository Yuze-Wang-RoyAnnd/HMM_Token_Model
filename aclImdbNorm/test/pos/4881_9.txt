i'm not into reality shows that much, but this one is exceptional because at the end, the viewer gets something useful out of it besides entertainment. i don't have children but supernanny's lessons will be a great help when (and if) i ever do! my only complaint is that the show has been watered down since it has been in the us. i prefer the british version, with the sterner nanny approach. is it just me or does anyone else find the us version to be a bit soft... now it's the "kinder, gentler" nanny? i guess we yanks need a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down after all?! still, nothing wrong with a sappy happy ending, is there?
