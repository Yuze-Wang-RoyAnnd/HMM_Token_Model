this is a movie about the music that is currently being played in istanbul. istanbul was the center of the two old world superpowers, the byzantine empire and the ottoman empire. today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. so it is to no ones surprise that a lot of music is being played in istanbul, with a great variety of voices, styles, and influences from everywhere on the globe. it is turkish music, of course, and i was fascinated by turkish music ever since i bought my first record long time ago. the movie features different singers, instrumentalists and bands. spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played, and the social context in modern turkey. for my perspective, the most interesting comments were from orhan gencebay. furthermore, the movies shows urban scenery mainly from istanbul which is very pleasant to watch.<br /><br />"crossing the bridge" is listed as a documentary and it includes music from minorities, e.g. kurds and roma. other important topics are omitted such as turkish jazz music, or music of the armenians and greeks.<br /><br />this movie is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of turkey, the balkans, the eastern mediterranean, and the middle east. it may also be worthwhile for those with a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles such as rock and roll or hip hop.
