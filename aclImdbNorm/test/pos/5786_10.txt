i own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. i have seen loads of them and love all of the great info out there. only a small handful though even come close to offering info as important as this one. i have been reading through other peoples reviews of this film and can't help but notice that the main things people are criticizing are irrelevant. such as "it is very one sided" such a pathetic criticism, every where in society that you look you will see the other side, and if you still need help go to globalpublicmedia.com. "it is the same people over and over" uh one might be led to believe that these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to interview. "filming style is all the same, head shots with few exceptions" if you want flash and dazzle watch micheal moore if you want info watch real docs such as this one. as you can plainly see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained. my guess is that these people are just missing the point and don't wanna give up there suv's.<br /><br />my recommendation: watch it. learn from it, and continue your education about such subjects. it is very important stuff for everyone.
