one of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. it's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. i can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this movie was done. the scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. with a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. the simple, yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can.<br /><br />the excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except l. q. jones as the moody but funny sheriff and strother martin as the town doctor. martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. with that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies, for me anyway. what an actor!<br /><br />so, it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition. i think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside rosemary's baby and the exorcist. one helluva movie!
