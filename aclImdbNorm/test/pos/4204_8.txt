i wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. it's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, john garfield.<br /><br />garfield plays jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. he must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids. here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. before the term 'method' was even coined and before brando ever screamed 'stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'golden boy' role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting worth.<br /><br />ann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jack's trampy girl goldie. i haven't ever thought much of sheridan, but i liked her here. she plays well off garfield. dickson's' performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield. the dead end kids are here, and garfield seems their natural idol (even more so than cagney). claude rains is miscast, and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. strange, as he always was such a reliable actor.<br /><br />also interesting to note is the director- busby berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.<br /><br />a very good film that deserves greater attention 8/10.
