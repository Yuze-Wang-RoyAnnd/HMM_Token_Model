gamers: dr is not a fancy made movie, it's more like amateur video. horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village...... sword, axe, shield, robe, plate..... okok... everything. you will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual, then you will get 105 minutes of fun.<br /><br />i'm from hongkong and it's really hard to find rpers, none of my friends play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d&d. watching gamers: dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer. you see rule books, dices, game set, etc etc etc; you hear terms like "fighter", "wizard", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil".<br /><br />what rpg fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to, not bonded by software rpg. gamers: dr provide the same element, you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead. the movie goes both gamers's real life as well as in the d&d world. you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game.<br /><br />i don't want to spoil anything, but in short, gamers: dr is a must watch movie for rpg lovers. for people never play rpg game, i'm sure you still get many fun from it.
