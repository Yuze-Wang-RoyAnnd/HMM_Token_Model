i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. it has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it (in all the 3 schneider movies) without a doubt. several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on schneider's way of seeing things. by the way, helge schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the jazz-musicions in germany (maybe europe). he is mostly inspired by the great m.davis and t.monk. so if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of h.schneider you would have to "surrender".
