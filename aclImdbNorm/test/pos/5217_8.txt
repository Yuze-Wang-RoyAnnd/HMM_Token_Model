he is very good in this role as a disaffected and bored husband, a decorated air force officer, who becomes bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change.<br /><br />one evening he meets karen sillas, an attractive woman younger than his current wife. a relationship develops, and cole decides to take it to the next level.<br /><br />not only does he have an affair, he fakes his death to escape his family obligations. lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife (sillas) happy, and to project the image that he is a success. a fictional delusion, apparently.<br /><br />this was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing. cole is believable and excellent in these roles. recommended. 8/10.
