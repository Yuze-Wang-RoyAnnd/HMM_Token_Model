i suspect there's some revisionist history going on here,but one definitely comes away with the feeling that patrice lumumba was a trouble-maker who incited his people to violence from the moment the congo declared independence.his inability to control his people and his decision to bring in soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the united states involved and led to his assassination.however,by replacing him with mobutu,the united states didn't solve anything.they made the situation just as bad.well-acted with excellent cinematography and a rousing score.definitely worth seeing.
