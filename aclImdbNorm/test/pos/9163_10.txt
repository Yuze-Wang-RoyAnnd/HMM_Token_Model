filmed less than a year after the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan, the subject matter was fresh in the minds of the cast, the director and the audience. most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war. the soviet army cooperated quite a bit during filming, which is odd. <br /><br />the afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. this film shows the tension and the cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil-war.<br /><br />there is no lack of powerful scenes. one of the first is footage of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport bound for the ussr. solders go about their work while an officer calmly ticks off the destinations: moscow, rostov, donetsk, the baltic. <br /><br />an earlier comment describes the last scene with maj. bandura as illogical. it is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship bandura maintained was with the afghan family which he accidentally kills in the assault. having lost his only buffer against the senselessness of the war, bandura turns his back on the boy(and his gun) in resignation to his fate.<br /><br />i particularly liked the last scene: a flock of mi-28s rising over the mountains as the voice of a pilot yells: "uhodim! uhodim rebyata! (we're leaving! boys, we're leaving!) in a tone of sincere relief.<br /><br />afhanskii izlom is an excellent film - brutally honest and as unholliwood as they come.
