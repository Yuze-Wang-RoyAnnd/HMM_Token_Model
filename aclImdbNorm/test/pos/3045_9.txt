i first saw this film when i was in the 8th grade and i remember that it had a profound affect on me then. i saw in again about a year ago (i am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. this is a great movie that personifies the struggle of "principle vs. pragmistism". voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the superintendent, mr. skeffington. that story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change. often at the expense of children. when these battles finally come to a boil, pat conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphant. or does it? the children that he has to leave are better off for knowing him, more exposed to the "real" world and to classical music. the other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned much about himself. a great film with a heart-breaking ending. i recomend that anyone who enjoyed the film to read the book, "the water is wide", by pat conroy. it will stay with you!
