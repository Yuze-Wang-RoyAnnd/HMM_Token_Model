chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. he spends time "over there" in world war one trenches. several gags stand out: limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. the cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. chaplin ends up capturing several german soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the german commander for refusing a cigarette. when asked how he did it, chaplin replies that he surrounded them. chaplin hides behind enemy lines as a tree of all things, and those scenes are very very funny. he escapes to a bombed house where he meets up with a french girl played by edna purviance. he's tracked down by german soldiers, escapes from them again, and purviance is arrested for assisting him. chaplin is able to pull a fast one by bopping a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. he ends up saving purviance of course and capturing the kaiser in the process. along the way, chaplin employs some sight gags and slapstick in turning back the german soldiers. with this film, chaplin explored the location possibilities in filming while maintaining the audience's attention for closer to feature length time, something his contract with the mutual film corporation disallowed him. the film also allowed him to poke fun at the enemy, something he would again do to greater effect in the great dictator. *** of 4 stars.
