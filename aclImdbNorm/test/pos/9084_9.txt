a film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. we are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. religion is declared dead. yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. what's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. that was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. today things are changing, especially when the president of the united states himself, barack obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. the film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable. post modernism had not reached hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the white house. so some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. it reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. one has to do with a drug addicted father of a vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. it is so na"ive that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. the film though is interesting but in something quite different. the setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, quite in the style of "death in venice" or greenaway, or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that death is. of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching.<br /><br />dr jacques coulardeau, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne, university versailles saint quentin en yvelines, cegid
