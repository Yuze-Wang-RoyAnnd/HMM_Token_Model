the internet is a wondrous thing is it not? i am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries, "vietnam:the ten thousand day war", from my dvr in florida usa to my laptop in kuwait; i'm writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in vietnam! amazing. i would like to just say that for minh nguyen to make the statement that america brought the war to vietnam is one sided. i know america was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war. the soviets and the chinese were major arms providers to the north so why mr nguyen doesn't mention them as partially to blame is showing an ignorance (well, i think we all know why he doesn't mention them, either ignorance from being raised in a communist system and its political dogma, or because he to scared to say the truth for fear of being arrested.). also, mr nguyen, i guess the parts about the north being the main aggressor it whole war were not shown in your country so to blame america again shows ignorance. regardless, its interesting to read a review from vietnam (of course that could be made up as well but i'll take that as real), at least the communist east is somewhat open. as far as the mini series; why do i love it? it doesn't focus on the american involvement solely. this was a war that started 15 years before america got involved and the series covers every facet of the history so thats a real plus. the footage used is first rate, all the vietnam war programs you see made now will use the same footage so you are not missing anything by watching this older series. the date this series was made is another plus. it has all the major players being interviewed which you can't do now because they are dead from old age, it's a major historical reference. third, richard basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice sounds as distinguished as james earl jones voice would and i think thats very steep praise. i don't think you could find a better war documentary ever made, it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it to the year 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of world war two, it does that for the vietnam war.<br /><br />ok, i do see some bias, its subtle, a 1970's-80's style subtle bias kind of like npr "all things considered" bias where it all seems so straight forward but when you blink you end up shaking your head. in this shows case the later episodes don't throw a whole lot of light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, don't you think????? <br /><br />from an oif war veteran going through the same thing 30 years later.
