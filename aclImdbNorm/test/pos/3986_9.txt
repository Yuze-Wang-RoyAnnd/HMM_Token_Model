this is a brilliant film. the story starts off in romania,where billy crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. there is a really funny scene here, where crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of crystal's religion). he is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. after finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river. believing he is dead, some huge hands come out to reach him. he later thinks he is in heaven. he finds out that he isn't, but that he is in a monastery. believing god saved him, he becomes a monk, searching for who saved him. he later finds a 7 ft 7 in man, who he casts as the perfect villain (he also recites shakespeare!). see the film and find out the rest!
