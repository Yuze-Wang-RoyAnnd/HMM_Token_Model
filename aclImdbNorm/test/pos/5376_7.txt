i had been interested in this film for a long time, especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the dvd edition; however, i kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive price-tag and utter lack of relevant supplements. when it went out-of-print earlier this year, i finally gave in - but the entire order (which included a number of other highly-desirable titles) got lost in transit!; luckily, the dvd has been re-issued at bargain-price - and i'm sure glad i picked it up! <br /><br />anyway, this is one strange film, and a genuine sleeper: initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding small-town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goings-on. a small cast responds perfectly to a terse, absorbing and intelligent script: lead strother martin, in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctor/head of the witch's coven; l.q. jones and alvy moore (both of whom also produced the film!) offer solid support as the no-nonsense sheriff and his comic-strip aficionado assistant.<br /><br />the plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural, and not only the obvious titles: the fact that the town is held under a spell which can't at first be identified, for instance, brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in luis bunuel's sublimely surreal the exterminating angel (1962)!; the 'possessed children' angle was borrowed, perhaps, from village of the damned (1960); there have been many films - especially of a recent vintage - where the satanic rites of a witches' coven are shown: from the city of the dead (1960) to the devil rides out (1968) but, since the proceedings take place in modern-day america (albeit in remote surroundings) and revolve around elderly witches (seeking a 'renaissance'), the film they recall most of all is rosemary's baby (1968).<br /><br />the occult scenes (accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishly-decorated house where the diabolical events take place) are presented in a completely matter-of-fact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective - particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car(!), the rampage of a devil-doll (a concept which has been done to death over the years but, here, it raises an undeniable frisson), a surreal dream sequence (set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept, since they can't be buried!), a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven, a beheading committed by a horse-riding medieval knight(!) and the lengthy 'black mass' finale (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child they will be 'taking over', all dressed in red - except for a black-clad martin presiding over the ceremony) which culminates in ritual mass suicide! <br /><br />the film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat 'curtain'; it's so refreshing to come across a title (albeit a low-budget production) from a major hollywood studio, columbia, that contrives to go so completely against the grain (like, i said, the film is quite weird - extending also to the editing and the score)! it's odd, too, that such a classy - and cinematic - horror offering {sic} should come from a tv director most often associated with westerns and other family fare! by the way, the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth christopher lee/peter cushing collaboration nothing but the night (1972; which lee produced himself!) - a film i foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local tv, and which has been m.i.a. ever since!! <br /><br />p.s. this review of the brotherhood of satan will certainly contain spoilers but, then, the synopsis and artwork featured on the dvd cover manage to give everything away anyway!
