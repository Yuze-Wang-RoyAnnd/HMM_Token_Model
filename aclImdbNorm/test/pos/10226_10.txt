i absolutely love this movie. i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday. this movie brings up several questions. one is. who are the monsters of this world? to be different is just that. different. the real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness. they are those that everyone considers "a nice quiet bloke" who "didn't bother anybody". or they are worse they are the characters such as played by croneberg. men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own books of blood. i love the shapeshifters, people with gifts and those that may be abhorent for people to look upon. this movie touches on and explores what is normal. who are 'other' and what fear does to some. even though i gave this movie 10 i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed median. my other complaint was why didn't they ever make a second film. i for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end
