don't ask me why i love this movie so much...maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in, maybe it is the amazing monster effects, maybe because i enjoyed the novel "cabal", but it's probably because i love clive barker. i think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a wtf moment at the end. at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons. the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it. the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the "button face/mask" decker character. this is a movie about the monsters! about fantasy! about a place called midian! it's a story where the monsters are the good guys. there is truly nothing else out there like it! it's not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive's many great works. sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian - where the monsters are.
