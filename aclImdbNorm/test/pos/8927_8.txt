i rented this movie with very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. this movie is extremely good stuff. and one would never guess it was low budget.<br /><br />eighteen, directed by 'richard bell' centers around an 18 year old named pip, played by the superb 'paul anthony' who leaves his home because of the circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died. he is overcome with guilt by this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teen on drugs and alcohol. on his 18th birthday, his father tracks pip down and gives him a tape left for him by his grandfather, of which he was to listen to on his 18th birthday.<br /><br />the way the whole film is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. the present life of pip and the past life of his grandfather during ww11 of which pip listens to on the tape.<br /><br />the three outstanding performances in this movie are the ones from 'paul anthony' as pip and 'brenden fletcher' playing jason, the young 18 year ww11 soldier, his grandfather. also, the role of the ww11 wounded medic 'macauley' played by 'mark hildreth.' all putting in fine performances.<br /><br />a couple of concerns and scenes that didn't sit too well with me...the priest, father chris played by 'alan cumming' who is gay and in broad daylight pick's up the local street hustler the whole neighborhood knows about. and then we have the local store clerk named jeff, a sweetheart played by the attractive 'david beaszely' who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sleaze ball street hustler, clerk, who sleeps with just about anyone and in all likelihood is a walking toxic time bomb. on top of all that he's not a very likable person. this part just didn't ring true.<br /><br />the parts i really like the most was the flashbacks to the war. they were so well acted and very touching. there is a scene at the end where the one soldier is dying and the other soldier, 'jason' is there for him to comfort and show him love as he lays badly injured and dying. this is such a wonderful and touching scene it left me in tears. beautifully acted.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie. it is one of love, redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive.
