uzumaki, is a visually stunning film, and i don't think anyone is going to be able to argue that. but, unfortunately, the story somewhat falls flat.<br /><br />the film nevertheless is very entertaining. it uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non-existant story. the film almost works, just based on it's characters and style, but in my opinion, leaves something to be desired.
