where do i begin? let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the dvd -- my wife and i watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. i can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. it's worth hearing.<br /><br />i'm not a southern boy, but i spent some time around memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. this film almost smells of the south, it's so real. samuel jackson, one of my all-time favorite actors, is magnificent as the emotionally bent lazarus, and christina ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as rae, a woman who's been wounded severely during her brief life. i've always liked ms. ricci's work, but in this performance she's giving 137% of herself every second she's on the screen. awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film. <br /><br />there are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so i'm just commenting on the work. i'd heard the name justin timberlake before seeing "bsm," but had no idea what he looked like, or even why he's famous. bumping my head on 60 years old, i'm outside his target demographic, to say the least. after seeing this film i will recognize him. he can act! he gives a substantial, believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut. <br /><br />the director is from memphis, and shows reverence for his home region. he is also a fine story teller.<br /><br />.....and i must mention the music. i love blues, and the soundtrack for black snake moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan. <br /><br />i'm writing less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is overcoming my sentence structure. see this film, and i mean now.
