there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box-office failures. andaz apna apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. for once, an indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a kader khan type stereo-typical hoax. the movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. a humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. the complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. aamir khan plays the a street-smart guy, while salman khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. the villian played by paresh rawal,and his henchmen, junior ajit and "kaliaa" make you laugh in your sleep. although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being "loud" at times, it remains one of the scarce "funny" movies bombay has come up with after movies like padosan, golmal and other amol plaekar movies. it is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned.
