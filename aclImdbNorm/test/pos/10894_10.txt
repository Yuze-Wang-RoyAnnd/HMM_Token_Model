007's goldeneye is one of the best n64 releases ever.<br /><br />better than this game? well...star wars: rogue squadron, star wars: episode i-racer and the legend of zelda: ocarina of time are far better and superior games. but i still love goldeneye.<br /><br />this is the best adaptation from a movie second only to star wars adaptations. the story is perfect. it's like you are in the movie itself.<br /><br />the graphics are excellent. the movements are extremely realistic. the enemies' artificial intelligence are the best part in this game. i loved playing the stage in which james and natalya break from the janus base as the goldeneye prepares to burn it. escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult. eluding cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the gameplay.<br /><br />it's also the toughest game i've ever played. n64 games are usually very, very easy. goldeneye is the one exception. i'm still trying to beat the 00 agent difficult level, but winning the easier levels was already a great victory. i loved when alec trevelyan asked: "for england james?". i answered: "no, for me!" it happened just in the moment i blasted him to death. just like in the movie. i love accomplishing every objective.<br /><br />the multiplayer gaming is even better. at first i got killed every holy second. now, i know how to win. i love forcing my playmates by playing at license to kill.<br /><br />the music and sound are astounding. super mario 64 looks like an atari next to this. the only thing i still wanted to hear was the goldeneye theme song, that plays at the end of the movie.<br /><br />after zelda was released, i nearly forgot i still had this game. it's still excellent, even if it's already surpassed. i hope other 007 games are produced.<br /><br />fantastic job rareware! nintendo was very smart to release this game on the n64 exclusively. magnificent job nintendo!
