this is one of my favourite books and i remember watching this series and loving it immensely. sadly i have never seen it repeated or been able to get on dvd, but it made such an impact i have never forgotten it.<br /><br />the lead characters were perfect for the roles, especially the lovely bryan brown and although the scenes in australia were not entirely in keeping with the book at least they were there, unlike the film version with virginia mckenna which missed that part out altogether.<br /><br />i agree that gordon jackson's character of strachan is entirely different from the book but he is still excellent. for your information "moley75" "strawn" is the gaelic pronunciation of "strachan".
