for an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast. the acting is uneven but the plot is compelling. we could have used a bit more development of wes ramsey's character, but hey, the guy's fun to look at nonetheless! mary kay place and jacqueline bisset are like icing on the cake.<br /><br />it's not surprising that it was controversial on its release. it presents a less than flattering portrayal of the morman church and its relationship with gays. while, like brokeback mountain, it's about tolerance and accepting one's own life, i found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message. it was more moving, too.
