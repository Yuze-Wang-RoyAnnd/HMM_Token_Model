my brother got me hooked on carlin back in the 70s. i always loved his observational humor. that is, looking at every day things and finding the humor in it, like asking the question,"have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket? you can't do it! they keep bringing back to you!" and asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the "f" word, while making prefect sense with the discussion.<br /><br />however, during the 90s his stuff was less funny, and more angry. what he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society's face and say 'take a look!' at this point, his shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a gripe session. but in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense. he really made you think.<br /><br />here was carlin old and new. he starts out about the fun one could have by getting old, and later slamming the the state of the world. again making perfect sense.<br /><br />this was his best since "jammin' in new york", and as it turns out his last.<br /><br />i think what 'the shootist' was to john wayne, or 'a prairie home companion' to robert altman, 'it's bad for ya' is to george carlin. a fond farewell to a true great icon. love him, or hate him, i think he will be remembered.
