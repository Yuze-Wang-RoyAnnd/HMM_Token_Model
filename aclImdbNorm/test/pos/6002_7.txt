this was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy film. the costuming, the music, the cinematography - all artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience.<br /><br />ted danson, best know for his tv roles in "cheers" and "becker," was excellent in the role of gulliver. mary steenburgen (time after time, cross creek) performed equally well in her limited role as his wife.<br /><br />other performances i really enjoyed were james fox as dr. bates, alfre woodard as the queen of brobdingnag, and peter o'toole as the emperor of lilliput.<br /><br />this would make an enjoyable children's film, but it also would definitely appeal to adults for it's deep social commentary.
