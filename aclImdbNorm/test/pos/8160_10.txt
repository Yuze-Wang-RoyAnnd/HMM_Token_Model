back in 1982 a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men.<br /><br />i have been waiting for years for a good, old-fashioned romance between two men; latter days is all that and more.<br /><br />yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, clich'e-ridden, and quite corny. that is what makes it so wonderful. there is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />as to the issue of religion, sorry folks, but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now. it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members. gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection.<br /><br />i loved this movie. it has a perfect blend of a fantasy-romance grounded in the reality of the day-to-day lives of the characters. if i could give it more than ten stars i would. good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like latter days are unforgettable.<br /><br />it's about time!
