here you see mr. eastwood in all of his glory (i.e., at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal), but the "ladies" depicted are hardly typical of the south, then or now. the young girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive, some showing signs of developing into really depraved women, and geraldine page, full-blown in her corruption, hardly represents the mean when it comes to head mistresses of girls schools, either then or now. (that is not to say that there isn't the occasional bad apple in any barrel.) mr. eastwood has said this is one of his own two favorite films.<br /><br />"the beguiled" does have an original plot, a lot of attractive characters and many surprises in store for the viewer. it's thoroughly engrossing and entertaining but not really realistic. (i know, having grown up in the south and attended a girls' school and college. moreover, i have been acquainted with innumerable girls who did the same, not to mention their laid-back teachers, or you might even say "repressed professors" who were a far cry from the headmistress depicted here.) she is downright comical in her depiction of a southern gentle woman who is not quite what she seems.<br /><br />this movie was a little outrageous when it first appeared and still is, i think, but you won't be sorry you spent your time watching it.
