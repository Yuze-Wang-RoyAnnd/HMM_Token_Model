if you like silly comedies like airplane you'll love this movie! it's definitely in the style of airplane and scary movie. a fun film! it has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie. michael jackson, evan marriott, joyce giraurd, stuart pankin, charlie schlater and eric roberts. the special effects are hokey, but i think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy. there is apparently two versions of the film, one at blockbuster and one on the official website: misscastaway.com. the one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director. there's some fun behind the scenes material filmed at neverland with michael jackson as well. the movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's pg rated fun on the box.
