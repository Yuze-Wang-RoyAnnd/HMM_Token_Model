closet land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. it features only two actors in a single set, but never loses your attention. the set design is imaginative and troubling, the staging of scenes maintains your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. the acting is outstanding, with alan rickman and madeleine stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.<br /><br />i first saw this film in 1991, soon after it came out on video. it didn't play in theaters where i lived; not surprising, given its political content. it should be seen, though. it features a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in its citizens. the country is never named, which makes it all the more striking. it could be anywhere; east, west, 3rd world, 1st world. it illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; when government becomes the ruler of the citizens, rather than the servant.<br /><br />madeleine stowe is a children's author who has been dragged from her bed in the night and subjected to terror and torture. she finds herself in a room with alan rickman, a seemingly pleasant functionary. at first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go; but, fear causes her to remain and the terror escalates. she is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. the interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play, and twisted logic to break down the author. she is humiliated and browbeaten, forced to endure strenuous bodily positions, deprived of food and water.<br /><br />through it all, she refuses to give in; to do what the interrogator asks. she is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession. a simple little act. she refuses. through it all, she employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. it is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse. to survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse. these mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the tables on her interrogator. she starts attacking his own beliefs and profession, forcing him to examine his own life and motives. in the end, she is free, because she maintains the freedom of thought. the interrogator is the one trapped by the state.<br /><br />this movie was made during the height of the cold war, apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments throughout the world made daily news. it is even more timely in a world where "enemy combatants" are held and interrogated in secret prisons, denied legal rights or counsel; where "ethnic cleansing" lays waste to whole societies, and humanitarian aid is denied. it demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or other oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror.
