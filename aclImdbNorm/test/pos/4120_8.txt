just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. this is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. however, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. if you are a black sabbath fan, you have to see this. aside from having seen black sabbath in the sevnties and early eighties, i saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined ozzfest just like in this video. the concert was amazing, and very much like this, which was why i rented this in the first place. it's just about the best geezer-rock out there. check it out.
