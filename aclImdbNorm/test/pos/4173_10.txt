there are two ways to regard 'head'. either it is a dazzling, mind-blowing collage of music, old film clips, psychedelia and t.v. sitcom-style comedy, or a plot less, pretentious, rambling mess. the truth probably lies somewhere in between. it is also one of the best movies of all time.<br /><br />'the monkees' - davy jones, peter tork, mickey dolenz, and mike nesmith - had just finished their hit series, and wanted to do a movie. in collaboration with writer jack nicholson and director bob rafelson, they made 'head'.<br /><br />it begins at a bridge opening ceremony in san francisco, where the monkees gate crash the proceedings. mickey jumps over the safety rail, plunging hundreds of feet into the water. mermaids rescue him to the accompaniment of a gorgeous jerry goffin & carole king composition called 'the porpoise song' and visuals that make the stargate finale of '2001' look drab by comparison. by now you will either have switched off in puzzled disgust or be completely captivated.<br /><br />more bizarre happenings unfold; mickey uses a tank to destroy a coca-cola machine in the middle of the desert; the entire italian army surrenders to him; the group are hired to play to play the dandruff in victor mature's hair for a television commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group, describing them as 'god's gift to the eight year old's'; a surprise birthday party for mike goes wrong; the group are sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and to cap it all, are driven away inside a giant glass tank.<br /><br />you will either hate this or love it. i found it a refreshing change from mindless pop musicals of the 'let's do the show right here' variety. the songs are good too; 'daddy's song' is superbly choreographed by toni basil ( later to appear in rafelson's 'easy rider' ) and boasts wonderful editing, with davy's clothes changing colour at lightning speed. 'as we go along' is a lovely goffin & king number whose accompanying images carry a strong environmentalist message.<br /><br />frank zappa, annette funicello are just two of the guest stars to crop up. did victor mature read the script before agreeing to do this, one wonders? he's hilarious in it though.<br /><br />so mad there just has to be real genius behind it, 'head' is a little '60's gem and one worth revisiting time and time again. shame it did not find an audience at the time. if only 'spiceworld' had been like this!
