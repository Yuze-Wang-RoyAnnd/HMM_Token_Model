from the get go, you won't be able to look away, and you won't want to. "the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya" (suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu) is one of the most entertaining animes i've seen in a long time. if you can look away from the insane, and sometimes perverse, humor, it's easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work.<br /><br />part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order, so you may not understand some of the things they talk about at first, but as the series progresses you'll find yourself saying "ah, so that's what they meant!" even though this might confuse some people, after watching the show you'll be hard pressed to make a case against telling the story in this fashion.<br /><br />after all the focus is on the characters. the title character, haruhi suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of any anime ever. her opening speech to her class, in which she declares she is "not interested in normal humans," and is searching for "espers, aliens and time travelers," is absolutely bizarre, but she's lovable that way.<br /><br />then there's kyon, the "normal" guy who is pulled into the madness surrounding suzumiya-san. he's the narrator, and his quick wit always makes the scene that much more entertaining. he finds himself caught in the middle of various factions all trying to influence haruhi suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions; ironically, they are the very beings haruhi is searching for, and yet they cannot reveal themselves to her.<br /><br />the first is yuki nagato, a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the school literary club, and also a representative of the integration thought entity; she is basically an alien, though the best description of her is a computer program in a human body. her purely emotionless responses make her comically deadpan and always make you think there's more than meets the eye. then there's mikuru asahina, the time traveler, who happens to be incredibly cute, a major ditz, and the subject of suzumiya's plans to advertise her club, the sos brigade, to the world. the end result is that suzumiya does things to her that border on sexual harassment, making her dress up in fetish uniforms. the final character is koizumi itsuki, the timid and perpetually optimistic philosopher who happens to be haruhi's "esper," though he can only use his powers in certain conditions.<br /><br />the end result of all these characters is a comedy unlike any other, that is both crude and deep, and always brilliant. don't believe me? watch the first episode, their "student film." you'll see what i mean.
