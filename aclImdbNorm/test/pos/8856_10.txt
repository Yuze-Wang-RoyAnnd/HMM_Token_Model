in following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, the thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. john carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by rob bartin (with stan winston also on the team). these effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment carpenter sets up with his characters. the film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. it's given a full life by carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. for someone following in the footsteps of howard hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.<br /><br />with the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. unlike the squad in predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of kurt russell's maccreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of wilford brimley and keith david. and it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. i loved the long silences at times, with ennio morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).<br /><br />it ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. it remains one of carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. that's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. but given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without cgi. it's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a t.
