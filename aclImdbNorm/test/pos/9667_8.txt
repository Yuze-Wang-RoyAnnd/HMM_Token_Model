the romanian cinema is little known out of romania. no directors from romania came out to the attention of the international public, as some from other countries from eastern europe like hungary, czekoslowakia, or yugoslavia succeeded to do. one of the few great directors in romanian cinema is lucian pintilie, who 35 ago directed a great movie 'reconstituirea' - quickly taken out of the circuit by the communist censorship. after that film, still a reference for the romanian cinema, pintilie was not allowed to create freely in romania until the communist rule fell in 1989.<br /><br />'furia' reminds me pintilie's film 35 years ago. the title means 'the rage' and i cannot imagine why the distributors chose to translate it differently. it is about a lost generation. while in the classic of pintilie the root of evil is in the oppression and lies of the communist regime, here the young folks need to deal with the emergence of the sub-culture, and the moral filth that filled in the void left by the totalitarian rule. the end is tragic and painfully expected.<br /><br />the movie is well directed, and the acting is good. without too much complexity, it succeeds to create an emotional link between the characters and the viewer. one would say that some situations seem similar to '8 miles' or 'the fast and the furious' - but look at the date of the production! this film was made at the same time, if not before the western peers. if this is indeed the first film of director dan munteanu, as imdb says, it is an outstanding debut. in any case, a good movie, can compete and may sell well on the western market.<br /><br />there is hope for a new generation of romanian films that with some luck and good distribution will make its place in the international cinema scene.<br /><br />8/10 on my personal scale.
