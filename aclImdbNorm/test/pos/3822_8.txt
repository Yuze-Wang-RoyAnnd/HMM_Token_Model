ah the outer limits. i love that show. it was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. i loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. i guess i must have started watching way after it got canceled, when sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. it was a really good show, i don't know all about the seasons and everything but i do remember that every time i saw the screen freak out and the voice on the tv say: "there is nothing wrong with your television. do not attempt to adjust the picture" i would squeal with delight. it was a good show, and i enjoy watching it if it would come on. i give it a healthy 8 out of 10.
