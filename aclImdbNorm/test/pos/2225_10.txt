i'm having as much fun reading the user comments as i did watching the movie! it seems that this is the classic either "love it" or "hate it" movie. and i have to say that i not only am on the "love it" side, i'm going on a limb to say it this my favorite movie, ever! thank heavens i found it in the first place. almost impossible to find, i was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night uhf channel. of course my liking of sellers may make me a bit biased, but i can't see how anyone with a cornball, dry sense of humor (like me), can not be in love with this flick. the plot is great (but perhaps as a previous poster said, maybe the reason why it's not a widely known movie ... upset the medical field?) the acting is great (i can see why some may say the acting was horrible ... but that's what made this movie so great ... it's total tacky-ness) and the humor is gut busting. i'm proud to say i have watched this film no less than about 20 times and have pretty much every line memorized. this film is genius!!
