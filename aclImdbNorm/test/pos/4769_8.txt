just can't watch this bit too many times, it's full of true enthusiasm and cleverness mickey mouse had in his first 30 years. nowadays' mickey is an smart ass little whiner when compared this. steamboat willie always makes me smile, at least the ending where mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. animation is very nice and although steamboat willie has no dialog, the music is enough for it.<br /><br />imho if this bit doesn't deserve 10/10 then any cartoon doesn't not only because it's a true classic, but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch.
