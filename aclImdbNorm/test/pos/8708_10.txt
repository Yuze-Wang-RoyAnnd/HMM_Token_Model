this is a perfect example of a classic full moon pictures movie. any fan of horror/vampire flicks should definitely check this one out. original plot and good, easy to follow story. also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine horror with action. as of now, the only sequel i have seen to this movie is part iv, which i have to say is almost better than this original.<br /><br />i give it 10 / 10<br /><br />fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, slumber party massacre, skinned alive, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.
