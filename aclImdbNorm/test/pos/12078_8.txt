this has to be the ultimate chick flick ever. we taped it off the t.v. years ago and i've watched it about 30 times over the years. i hadn't seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie. i'm not lying, i cried from the opening credits to the ending credits. this movie truly tears your heart out, even if you don't have children.
