just got back from seeing black snake moan. i had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator" ... i hate when "critics" miss the point of a film. now i suppose it helps that i live in memphis ... and have lived in mississippi a couple of times too. it may also help that i am the former director of the delta blues museum in clarksdale ... but i get this movie. brewer's simple "redemption tale" is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story ... but i believe it is highly effect as a "blues". it would be my hope that people don't read all the hype ... and/or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties ... get past justin timberlake, accept his character ronnis (which he plays very well) ... get past "snakes on a plane" and see how mercuricul samuel l. jackson is ... as he has transformed himself into a very believable mid-south blues man. if you know little about mid-south culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish ... but accept the fact that craig brewer knows how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film. not one to tell endings ... so go see this movie ... and yes i will agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!
