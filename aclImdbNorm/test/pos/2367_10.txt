a lot of 'alternative' comedy in britain in the 1980s was insular, misguided, overly-political, and unfunny, and the worst of the comic strip presents... stuff fell into this category.<br /><br /> but this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels.<br /><br /> is dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying?<br /><br /> is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever?<br /><br /> i've probably watched supergrass 20 or 30 times, and i still can't decide 100%. that's the wonderful thing.<br /><br /> as well as ade edmonson, there are big roles for other early comic strip mainstays - french & saunders, pete richardson, alexei sayle, keith allen, nigel planer and robbie coltrane, though curiously enough not rik mayall.<br /><br /> all of the comic strip cast - however much i disliked the hidden agenda of some of their members - are convincing actors, and turn in superb performances in this big-screen outing, while the richardson-richens writing team's work is so often pure genius, with nice little touches of detail throughout.<br /><br /> ultimately this is a study of crime, criminology and human nature, in all it's wondrous complexity. and very funny with it. you will not be disappointed.
