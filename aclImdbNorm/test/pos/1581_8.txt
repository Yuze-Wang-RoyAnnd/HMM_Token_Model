i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but i'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say i like 'em, especially guts of a beauty (aka entrails of a beautiful woman). watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and i was surprised how well it actually went over.<br /><br />entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of asia (specifically japan in this case). it's basically a rape/revenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboat-propelled noose or even a ticked off daddy with a chainsaw...that stuff's just silly. wouldn't you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winky?<br /><br />perversion factor: this movie is high in graphic, sometimes wacky rape sequences, fake pop shots, and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like corman nuggets like humanoids from the deep. i dunno, maybe that's a stretch but i personally didn't think entrails of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bizarro b-pics.<br /><br />yeah, i know sometimes some of my recommendations are not always everyone's cuppa tea (even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as i do) but i stand behind this one. 8/10.
