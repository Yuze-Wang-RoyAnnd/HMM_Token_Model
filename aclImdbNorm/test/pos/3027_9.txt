what makes watching and reviewing films a pleasure is when every once in a while when you least expect it a film like the cell comes along and knocks your socks off!. this movie is a superb horror that has everything a you could want when you want to be scared out of your witts. without going into the story all i will say is that it has a great beginning ,middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being transfixed with the amazing special affects. the acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while. it is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but saying the credits it does not look like an adaptation , so a lot of credit must go to mark protosovich the writer. 9 out of 10.
