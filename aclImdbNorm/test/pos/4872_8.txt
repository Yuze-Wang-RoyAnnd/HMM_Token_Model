this is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular.....but who's complaining? it's always fun to see the poor coyote try various contraptions to get the road runner, and then get pulverized by every one of those inventions.<br /><br />the underground cave chase was different from the normal fare and was clever. it gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze-like structure. i didn't say it was hilarious; just different from the normal above-ground antics.<br /><br />this one, along with some other road runner shorts, are featured on the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 and the transfers of them are spectacular. the colors are magnificent.
