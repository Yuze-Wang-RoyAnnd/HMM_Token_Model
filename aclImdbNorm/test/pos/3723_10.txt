a poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue. the anti-hero, the man builds a contraption to escape a band of marauders, out of the wastland of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to scavenge for his survival. there he crosses pathes with the brute, brilliantly played by jean reno, of "the professional" and "mission: impossible" fame. the man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. by using their wits, the man and the old genius are able to keep the brute and his ilk at bay, but they realise it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised, so they make a break for it. this is a strongly understated tale of the desparate struggle for life, with excellent action scenes and clever humor. of all of the movies of its kind, like "road warrior", "omega man", and even "ultimate warrior" (featuring yul brenner as a buff knife-fighter), "le dernier combat" is the most artfully crafted. copies of the video are hard-to-find, i would give my left eye ball for one. if your local art house ever has a revival of this film, i heartily recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big.
