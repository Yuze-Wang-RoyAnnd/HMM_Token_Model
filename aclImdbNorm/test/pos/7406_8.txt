this film was my first acquaintance with the talents of chris cooper. i was deeply impressed with the character he played. i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor. he plays a union captain who, along with a couple of enlisted men, are foraging in eastern kentucky. they happen upon the farm of a "sesech" woman whose husband has chosen to go off to the confederacy. <br /><br />the portrayal of eastern kentucky, and its seriously divided sentiments during the war, is so very accurate. if you are looking for a war film with a lot of blood and guts, this would not be it. if you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples at war, actually and philosophically, then this is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the border states during america's civil war.
