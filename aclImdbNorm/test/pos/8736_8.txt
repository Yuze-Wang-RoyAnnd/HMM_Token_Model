i discovered this late one night on turner classics. i kept saying to myself "i'll turn it off as soon as it stops being funny", but needless to say i watched the whole way through.<br /><br />i am a movie junkie but i had never even heard of this movie (or if i did in 1971, i forgot). it's worth watching just for the performance of goldie hawn as the tart-tongued ing'enue. her acting is a revelation in this movie. yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a hollywood comedy with a smart script?) but her acting is extraordinary. i never realized how funny goldie could be, and it makes her later appearances in roles such as laugh-in and private benjamin a little sad. in her later career she is far too over-the-top compared to her minimalist, wickedly funny appearance here.<br /><br />it's a pleasure watching the young matthau, the great bergman and the stellar supporting cast, but it's goldie hawn that will make this movie worth watching again.
