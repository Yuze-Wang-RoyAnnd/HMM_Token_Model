movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning. motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. mishima falls into the latter category. this is the type of thing that should win academy awards, a brilliant, visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting. instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of yukio mishima, director paul schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on earth, the day he tried to lead the japanese military into rebellion in the name of the emperor. failing to do that, he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks. the three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays. ken ogata is magnificent as mishima. despite his eccentricities, he comes off as very sympathetic, a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does. this makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful. of the three story adaptations, temple of the golden pavilion, kyoko's house and runaway horses, it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional. it also is the story that most closely matches mishima's mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of november 1970. this review cannot be complete without a mention of philip glass' striking musical score. not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it's visuals. paul schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter. have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears. mishima: a life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant.
