i have nothing but praise for this mini series. it's only about a year and a half old but i have seen it twice already; with greater enjoyment the second time than the first. i'm seriously thinking of watching it again soon since i find it spiritually uplifting.<br /><br />it is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance which places it almost in a league of its own among mini series.<br /><br />some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in britain in the 1890s. nothing especially difficult about that; it was only male homosexuality that was against the law as poor oscar wilde experienced to his great cost and as a great loss to the literary world. anyway, i digress.<br /><br />in my view, this is essential television. it is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since romeo and juliet, although not in the conventional sense.<br /><br />10 out of 10 from me.<br /><br />jmv
