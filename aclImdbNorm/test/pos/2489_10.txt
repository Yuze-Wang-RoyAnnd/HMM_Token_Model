punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema. shot in the southern<br /><br />california desert using his patent faux documentary style, watkins<br /><br />creates a film like no other. he follows two groups of prisoners (one<br /><br />pre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the picture. after <br /><br />they're tried by a military tribunal, they have the choice of either<br /><br />serving out a prison sentence or they can participate in punishment<br /><br />park (a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but the<br /><br />clothes on their backs) whilst being hunted down by local law<br /><br />enforcement officers who use the park as a live action training<br /><br />ground). i can't say enough about this movie. sometimes it feels as if<br /><br />you're watching a real documentary. this is one of peter watkins most<br /><br />accessible films. i advise you to look out for it. you wont regret it!<br /><br />highly recommended<br /><br />a+<br /><br />
