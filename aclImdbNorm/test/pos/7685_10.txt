i was in my early 20's, just graduating from college when this movie appeared. seeing it was event of great impact, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its many awards), but because of its place in the historical context of 1959. because of social progress since then, it is nearly impossible to fathom that my college had only begun admitting (carefully screened) black students in 1953. a mainstream, high-budget extravaganze with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959.<br /><br />the movie was given a deluxe roadshow (reserved seat) presentation in only the best theatres, complete with a souvenir program detailing the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color, multi-track stereo sound, etc. almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie. gershwin's music, superbly performed, and the sheer universal humanity of the story was tremendously moving.<br /><br />i was recently able to obtain a faded copy of a two-hour cutting of the film, and repeated viewings have confirmed my opinion. time has made what seemed steamy sex scenes in 1959 seem quite tame, but the musical quality has not diminished. sammy davis and pearl bailey are masterful in their portrayals. what a crime that the young black artists of today are unable to see these performers at the peak of their careers!
