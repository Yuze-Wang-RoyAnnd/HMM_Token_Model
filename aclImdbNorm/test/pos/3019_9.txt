***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** the cell / (2000) **** (out of four)<br /><br />"do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? during a session when i'm inside, i get to see those things."<br /><br />--catherine deane<br /><br />and so do we. one of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "the cell" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it. i can understand the reasons some people dislike this production. with a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind-probing, "the cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. i think it's one of the year's most engrossing films.<br /><br />making his feature film screenwriting debut, mark protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. the filmmakers take advantage of every shot. protosevich conceived ideas for "the cell" in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his major interests, mind-probing and serial killers. he was reportedly influenced by such directors as wes craven, george romero and david cronenberg. they would probably be proud of such an imagination.<br /><br />the film combines two major narratives, one about scientific exploration of the human mind, and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure. catherine deane (jennifer lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at the campbell center, a research clinic. because of her empathetic personality, scientists chose deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen in hopes to revive his brain into waking.<br /><br />a sick, demented serial killer roams the streets. within an abandoned rural farmhouse, stargher (vincent d'onofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. the killer escapes from the fbi every time they draw near, until now. a violent seizure renders him comatose. the fbi captures his forever unconscious body. unfortunately, he already prepared the cell with his latest victim. in forty hours, the cell will fill with water, and stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim.<br /><br />the fbi takes this situation to campbell center, where catherine enters the mind of stargher, hoping to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water, sending the woman to a watery grave.<br /><br />the science fiction portions of the story relied on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the neurological cartography and synaptic transfer system. the premise takes a long time to develop, but it is worth the wait. it is far fetched, but that doesn't matter. the film makes us believe. even if you don't suspend disbelief, however, the visual enticement provides an engaging setting to enjoy.<br /><br />according to the film's production notes, mark protosevich was thrilled to work with the director, named tarsem, because they both think visually. tarsem singh is known for his attention to detail, stunning art direction, and highly developed abilities to tell a story. "when i wrote 'the cell'," explains protosevich, "i surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of painter's paintings or photographs while i was working. so i'm thinking visually, and tarsem is a highly visual director. tarsem has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration."<br /><br />vincent d'onofrio provides the film with a backbone, and no actor could have accomplished his character any better. he delivers a mysterious, disturbing, and engaging performance. "i think that my character is, in a way, trapped in himself," d'onofrio ponders. he also researched the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character. his in-depth performance preparation pays off beautifully.<br /><br />while the actors, writer, and director do wonders with their material, the real honor goes to the film's behind-the-scenes talent. the director of photography paul laufer, production designer tom foden, costume designer april napier, special effects coordinator clay pinney, and visual effects supervisor kevin tod haug. they bring the world of "the cell" to life. it's is an extraordinary world worthy of several viewings. some movies you watch, others you experience. "the cell" falls into the later category.<br /><br />
