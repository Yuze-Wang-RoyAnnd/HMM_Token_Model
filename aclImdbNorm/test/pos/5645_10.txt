this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films. there's no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell. it's this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power. there aren't any attempts to make a hero out of ichikawa's protagonist tamura either. he's just a poor doomed sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes, but isn't sure, he can hang on to his humanity in the process. ichikawa's fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone. ichikawa died february 2008.
