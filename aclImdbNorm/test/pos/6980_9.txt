i've seen director's cut version and can be nothing but content. excellent acting (esp. cole hauser, i was sad about little space for claudia black though), subtle visual effects and photography in overall, believable plot (considering the genre) without a lot of logical holes, really non-predictable twists, build-up characters. these are the greatest assets of the movie. combined with style - some may consider this movie a b-grade effort but i would disagree with that. the whole thing really is very original and stylish.<br /><br />and even though i'm not a fan of vin diesel, this tough guy role of riddick suited him well. can't wait for chronicles of riddick, it's really cool this flick's gonna have a sequel...<br /><br />9/10 if you ask me
