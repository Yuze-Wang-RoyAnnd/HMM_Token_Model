maybe i'm biased because the f-16 is my favorite fighter aircraft - although the f-14 is probably second or third - but i liked this movie. the sequels (iron eagle ii and iii) don't measure up acting and plot wise, but the first one - along with top gun - have excellent flying and music, along with reasonable plots and acting. ii and iii clearly have much less of a "flight budget", but their main drawback is plot and acting. i suspect the relative fame and popularity of iron eagle compared to top gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of jason gedrick compared to tom cruise. another plus (for me) is an all too brief appearance by shawnee smith. 7/10
