james hacker mp didn't expect that he would be the next prime minister. unlike in america, the party is elected in britain while we, americans, vote for candidates regardless of their party. despite the differences, paul eddington cbe's performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior adviser, sir humphrey, played by another knight, sir nigel hawthorne, and veteran actor derek fowlds also returns to the scene as well. now instead of pleasing some people, he has to please the nation rather than his constituency. now, he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before. now, he must approve the honors list and work with her majesty as well on a regular basis. hacker is not the hacking type. he is rather than the every man who we like and don't want to dislike and turn into a villain of sorts or a vicious dictator. now, we see the prime minister's point of view and all the pleasing that must go on as well as handle strikes.
