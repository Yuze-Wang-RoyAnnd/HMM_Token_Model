okay , so this wasnt what i was expecting. i rented this film just to see how it would be since i want to see the first one anyway. but , this film had b-movie all over it. but when i watched it i realized that it was very funny. for the first 30 minutes it was just how the snowman was kiiling people and one man losing his sanity. but , those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it. when he throws up the first of his little minions i knew this would be very very funny. they all act like the gremlins in the ninteen eighty four hit gremlins that it made it look like it was spoofing it and made me forget it was a b-movie. so if you like to laugh rent this one.
