this movie deserved better. mike judge's satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny... we're getting dumber as a society.<br /><br />could the 24-hour-a-day anna nicole coverage be any more proof? mike judge paints a frightening future, where the dumb survive and thrive. makes you stop and think, and laugh. can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber? are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash? (beware of landslides).<br /><br />the movie is really funny. i'd tell you more of the plot but i don't want to spoil it.<br /><br />so why release this film with zero promotion? could it be that the stupid are already taking over?
