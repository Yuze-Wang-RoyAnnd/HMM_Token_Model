i first saw this movie in a queer film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether i needed help - i was still sitting, crying like a maniac. the movie is cheesy, it's bizarre, it's over the top, it's gay - but it is amazing. i do think that every character is plausible. everett's character is mean to a woman who only tries to help, he brutally throws his (terrible) friends out, he does have a temper, he can harm a fly, the "fly" that killed the love of his life, doubly so. bates is a miracle, she is perfect, just like a role. a woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love. i even understand max (the husband), he is bored with his life, he's got a midlife crisis. he moves out, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realise a) that he's the really boring part in the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. i love the fact that she comes back to him in the end because i think that it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. for in the end he's her husband and he might not be as exciting as victor but he's real, he is the man she loves in a very down to earth way. i've watched it about 50 times and i do love this film, everything about it unconditionally. btw, just read rupert everett's autobiography and ul is the only film that he talks of as one of the best films he ever made. to me it's the best film he ever made.
