a dangerous psychopathic killer jacob goodnight is holed up in the abandoned and rotting blackwell hotel,alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded jacob four years ago.when one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain,the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives..."see no evil" was directed by the porno filmmaker gregory dark and it stars wwe superstar kane as remorseless psychopath.the supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here,but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy.overall,i liked this film and you should too,if you are into mindless slasher flicks.sure,it's clich'e,but who cares.7 out of 10.
