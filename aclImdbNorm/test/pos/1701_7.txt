ok, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. don't get me wrong, 'american werewolf in london' is a superior film, but 'american remake in paris' is a decent movie as well.<br /><br />first off, the only real similarities are the title, 2 american backpackers, and werewolves. other than those 3 things, 'american remake in paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror. most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap. while those of us who grew up in the 80's can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today. what a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films, including the b&w ones, horror wouldn't be what it is today. now i'm getting a little off the beaten path...<br /><br />an american werewolf in paris is a good attempt at re-creating a classic, but it will never surpass the original, ever. with that said, this is still a very entertaining film to watch and i do recommend it. i'm giving it a 7 out of 10. maybe that's being a little generous, but i've seen much worse attempts at trying to re-create a classic.
