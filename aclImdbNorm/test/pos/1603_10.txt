personally, i can only but agree with stephen-12: indulge. there's really no point in trying to 'capture' this film. i like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. herzog's 'aguirre, der zorn gottes' has got the same nothingness, though that movie is less convincing, since the climaxes are rather in the beginning of the story, so herzog had to focus on nature versus kinski. morte a venezia is wholly different though, since it has several climaxes, turns, etc. in fact, from the point where aschenbach's luggage is lost, the movie almost 'rushes' to its grand finale (his final grains of sand begin running through the hourglass after the moment of bliss where he fantasises about warning the polish family and caressing tadzio's hair).<br /><br />you can, if you want to, seek some real clues/symbols in this one (his trying to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives, the pointing tadzio at the end, the fact that in the whole film content and form are completely in sinc), but there's no point in doing this: it won't make the film better or worse, since its force lies in the whole storyline's undertow, which is never made explicit. tons of history, decaying europe, the end of the 'romantic era' as we've come to know it, which has proven to be only the beginning of it (individual emotions & expression are more important now than they ever were). but wait, now i myself am beginning to develop the one minor (tiny) flaw of the film: the 'let's talk about art'-parts. now there's one thing never to do. i myself believe it could have been expressed by other means. furthermore, i believe it becomes already very clear in the rest of the film.<br /><br />i don't like explicit films. i can read books, so i don't want a storyline that speaks merely to my rationale. i prefer films that you cannot explain in words, but only in film (lynch's lost highway, weir's picknick at hanging rock and roeg's man who fell to earth also belong in this category), for then, and then only, it has a reason to exist as film and not merely as a book. so what about thomas mann's novella? i've never read it, but forget about it! the movie gives a different point of view: it says things you can never say in a book. it uses the movie-art to make you feel, through images and music, the same thing that mann made you feel, using text. equally brilliant, but different worlds.
