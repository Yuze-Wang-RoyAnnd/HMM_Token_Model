forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book. so what? this is a film after all. it is a sheer joy to watch, made entirely on location in cephallonia, gorgeous photography but with dark, disturbing moments as well. the only problem i have is with the obvious miscasting of nicolas cage as captain corelli. apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise.
