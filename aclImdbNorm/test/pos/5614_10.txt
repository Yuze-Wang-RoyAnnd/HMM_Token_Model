as you can tell from the few comments posted here - mine may very well be the last you'll see, unless there is a big dvd-release or tcm plays it again ! - this is a kind-of "our gang" movie with a bunch of different kids. mgm certainly was the musical studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers weren't under contract, they were on tap. heifetz was one of the most expensive.....that does it for a little charity work !!! the fee he received in that era was unheard of. another musical film with jose iturbi (mexican pianist) featured about 100 kids playing some simple tune on 100 pianos......so, those skeptics who think young children aren't musical are mistaken: i was one.<br /><br />as all write, "frankie smith" - good-ole american name - (gene reynolds) was the bad-but-good kid who is taken-in from the streets by the owners of a music-school. can you believe that walter brennan ("prof. lawson") of all those western movies was the man running the school? joel mccrea ("peter mccarthy") and andrea leeds ("ann lawson") were the bigger stars in "they shall have music", with a host of well-known extras (many of whom went-on to become stars in their own rights). as others have commented, almost all of the kids in the orchestra (actually, the meremblum symphony from los angeles) made big successes of their lives, either as musicians (for the studios) and other businesses.<br /><br />sad to say, there aren't that many young-people's orchestras today - a sad mistake. parents with children in school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water, and many don't even know what is happening to the kids in school. musical instruction can get to be pricey, and almost everyone would rather had a football-team.....<br /><br />this is the cheapest concert by jascha heifetz you'll ever hear is contained in this movie.....in those days, a quarter. his playing is brilliant, even if he looks like he'd rather be someplace else.....emotionless. by contract, any concert by yo-yo ma is so joyful, it makes you want to run right out and buy a cello.....this guy is having a good time....like the kids in the "street" concert, when they hoodwink heifetz to play at their school.<br /><br />all of the orchestral numbers were played by "the kids," and they make it sound easy. i love this type of movie - their plots are so simple, it doesn't take you two days to figure-out if you enjoyed - or understood - the movie, at all. we need some new movies like this - can't do anything but inspire younger kids to play other instruments than guitars.......bravo!
