i have 2 complete sets from time life, this is my favorite movies of all time. love all the actors and actresses.. awsome picture..love patrick swazy..this is the film, that showed his true talent. but yet, he does not get credit for the display he preformed! much credit has been missed in these films.love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty monologs of the civil war..making it into one of the greatest love stories of all time, and showing through all obsticals of life, what true freindship means..how 2 divided countries split.but yet all and all the freindship remained solid, even though the war divided kinships and freindships up.but through it all, till the very end, they remained and taught us the viewer, how true freind ships can still remain till present day! simply the best..gone with the wind doesn't compare to this film.patrick swazy at his best,.after seeing this movie for the one hundred thousand time. i became a big fan of swazy..and have followed his career ever since..have all his movies after he made north and south!
