very enjoyable 50's western. i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans.<br /><br />mostly victor mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.<br /><br />he's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. red cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. they all joined as scouts after their loss.<br /><br />victor has set his eye's on the colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.<br /><br />action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.<br /><br />50's westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction. a western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again. one to enjoy. gave it a 7 rating. likely 6.8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time.<br /><br />for film-noir fans..."the big steal" "they live by night" "side street" are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed. bought and viewed. noir seems to resemble westerns in a way. some long ago and never forever.
