from the first to the last scene, this film is made very realistically,even too realistically that sometimes we can't see details in night scenes(it's dark as real night),in the desert(sunshine is so strong as in real desert). <br /><br />script and actor's play are also very realistic. shots and episodes are edited not to show things and events "effectively", to "explain" them, or,as many hollywood films do, to "entertain" viewers. editing here is to represent the events as if they really happened in afganistan. camera is set sometimes far from dying solders, even the moment when the main character major bandura is shot and killed.<br /><br />such method reminds me of masterpieces of italian neo-realism. and the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as "pais`a",or "the bicycle thief"--chronological series of "true to life" episodes and a few pathetic moments, which at first seem to be sudden and illogical, but have inner reasons.<br /><br />i think the inner reason of major bandura's suicidal death is religious emotion--repentance for innocent people's death(not only his accidental killing of family in the village, but also death of solders under his command).he is not depicted as a eager believer,on the contrary he is depicted as tactful and responsible officer.exactly for this reason his last decisions(to go back to the destroyed village and to turn his back to an armed boy, whose family he killed)seem an act of repentance. <br /><br />the russian orthodox choral, which sounds at the end("evening sacrifice")is another context,by which all the film can be seen from this point of view.
