the story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in tales of the soul. that being said, this is the only gripe i have about the game.<br /><br />the beginning fmv is spectacular with breath taking sceneries and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own martial arts discipline. there's even a second story mode which makes up for the awkward story design of tale of the souls.<br /><br />parts of the fmvs during tale of the souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your character to a certain degree which is an interesting feature.<br /><br />with the many combinations of characters you can create, the varied paths you can explore in tales of the souls and the chronicle of swords story mode, this game will keep any beatem up/rpg fans amused for a while!
