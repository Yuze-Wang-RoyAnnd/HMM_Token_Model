during my teens or should i say prime time i was "eating up" all kinds of sf novels every day of the week. it was in the sixties and seventies when tv was not such a important leisure time killer like today, one night in the mid seventies i watched the movie on tv i think it was ard and i was stunned. i was impressed in a way that i can almost remember each scene even today.<br /><br />nowadays i observe my kids playing the sims or something like that and i think we are close to what that fassbender movie expressed. i also would highly appreciate if i could buy this movie on a dvd. but in vain i tried almost everything to get a hint where. the movie matrix cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie. and by the way by now we do not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple simulation models. probably after our death we definitely will know...
