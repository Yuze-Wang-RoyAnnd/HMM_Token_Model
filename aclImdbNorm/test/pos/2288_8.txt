this has always been a favorite movie of mine. i've owned a vhs copy, and a couple of months ago i found a dvd release which is also part of my video collection. i also happen to be a huge baseball fan, and as part of my off-season reading, i picked up a copy of robert whiting's excellent book "you gotta have wa", that profiles the ins and outs of japanese baseball, and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in japan. as i began to read yesterday, it made me think of this movie, because it appears the screenplay was based almost verbatim on this book. the parallels are uncanny. the jack elliot character closely resembles bob horner, an aging mlb slugger whose best days were behind him. horner's teammate leon lee is also depicted in the character max "hammer" dubois, a veteran in the japanese league who has made his peace with the frustrations of the japanese game, and helps keeps his teammate sane. the elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as horner, from big fanfare signing, early success that fuels an already ravenous sports media, and the ensuing slump that spurs frustration, alienation from teammates, fans and media, and the resulting disillusionment that prompts a desire to go back home to the us. the only difference is that the movie adds such hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending. <br /><br />speaking of love interests, i'm sure many viewers have come to this site (as i did) to look up the actress who played "hiroko" (the beautiful aya takanashi), and what other work she has done. it only lists this movie. it turns out, based on an article i read, that the brief love scene she has with tom selleck (a foreigner) in this movie (mild by our standards - basically they kiss while he's in the bath and she's wearing a towel) caused such an outrage on the part of the japanese public (males in particular) that she has never been offered another role of any kind, in movies or television - essentially blackballed by the japanese movie industry. it's a real shame, as she is(was) quite a talented actress in this movie. <br /><br />if you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as i did -- go find a copy of "you gotta have wa" by robert whiting. a good read and a great companion book to this movie.
