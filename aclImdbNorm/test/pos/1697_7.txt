andy mcdermott (tom everett scott) is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with his friends brad and chris. andy saves serafine pigot (the gorgeous julie delpy) from committing suicide in eiffel tour and has a crush on her. he does not know that she is a werewolf. they go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. he is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. this movie is a violent black humor movie. the special effects and the soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the song of the band bush. i do not know why some readers compares this movie with the masterpiece 'an american werewolf in london'. the stories have nothing in common (only an american teenager, werewolves and a city in europe). highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor movies. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "um lobisomem americano em paris" ("an american werewolf in paris")
