1996's michael is warm and winning comedy-fantasy that features one of my favorite performances from the john travolta library. travolta gives one of his breeziest and most likable performances as michael, an archangel whose quiet existence at the home of a lonely innkeeper named pansy (jean stapleton) is disrupted when pansy reports michael's presence in her home to a "national enquirer"-like newspaper and the editor (bob hoskins) sends reporters (william hurt, andie mcdowell, robert pastorelli) to the motel to check it out. hurt, mcdowell, and pastorelli are quite good as the jaded news staffers who have a hard time accepting they've met an angel but this is travolta's show and he rules as the pot-bellied, sugar-eating, cookie-smelling, pie-loving, aretha-loving, bull-chasing michael, an angel who just isn't what you think you of when you think of angels. and you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to "chain of fools". i love this movie more and more every time i watch it and it's mainly because of the completely winning performance from john travolta.
