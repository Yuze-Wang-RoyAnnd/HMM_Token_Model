viva la bam was one of those shows that i didn't have high if any expectations for, before seeing it, and i never even knew about it until i saw my friend watching it. i had thought jackass was pretty funny but the stunts were just that, funny and i never really got into the show. when i watched viva la bam for the first time it was the complete opposite effect, i loved it. it had more of a tv show feel to it, which a lot of the "reality shows" have today. i was hooked and i wanted to see what new scheme they were going to cook up for each episode. all the way to the last episode it held my interest and even though some of the ideas seemed rehashed at times, it always had a newer and funnier twist to it. viva la bam is one of those shows that get you hooked and i have yet to see another show that is quite like it.
