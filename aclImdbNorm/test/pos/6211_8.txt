when i first saw colleen moore it was in the excellent series about silent films called "hollywood". there she was in 1980, her hair defiantly bobbed as it was in the twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the very definition of "presence". then i saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like "ella cinders" and "orchids and ermine". then the disappointingly sombre talkie "the scarlet letter". and now here she is in "the power and the glory" giving a performance of staggering power, working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema's finest actors - spencer tracy.<br /><br />i found the movie a little lack lustre story-wise, but moore and tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter. both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film - and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes. moore is almost unrecognisable as the elderly wife, and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes i have ever seen. she does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge, even over tracy. contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and tracy is struggling to propose to her. astonishing! what this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.
