what's there not to like?<br /><br />i caught this again tonight and marvelled as to hugh bonneville's capturing of the essence of philip larkin without resorting to tics and caricature.<br /><br />there are many layers to the depiction of the complexity of the main character and hugh brings them to life. his prudish mother, his unresolved issues with his father and his inability to commit to one woman. <br /><br />his poetry is interlaced throughout and some scenes are caught in his recounting of them to the wife of a friend whom he later propositions but quite casually, almost innocently. it is not difficult to see where his attraction lay for the many women who fell in love with him (and knew about each other, to boot, and continued to see him!) <br /><br />cerebral, fun-loving, jazz aficionado, loyal friend. it is always more than looks, women moved beyond his baldness, deafness and short sightedness. and a beautifully nuanced performance by eileen atkins as his mum is an added bonus.<br /><br />9 out of 10.
