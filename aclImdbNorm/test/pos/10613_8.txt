it's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory. because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. however in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when coward must make like the flying dutchman, he's much less comfortable.<br /><br />but his way with an epigram is peerless, and hecht & macarthur have given him some gems (macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair).<br /><br />the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (note: h&m themselves have blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).<br /><br />the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott, notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward.<br /><br />curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table, of which he was a founder, and macarthur something of an auxiliary member.<br /><br />the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. it's coward, woolcott, and the dialogue you remember...
