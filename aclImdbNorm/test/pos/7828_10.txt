without doubt a great all round show that if shown today would attract a huge following.bodyguards was only 6 episodes and a trailer,but deserved a few more series to really bring it up-to speed.with outstanding performances from the highly talented and versatile sean pertwee and the dynamic louise lombard,it really did put it up with the likes of the proffesionals,the sweeney and thief takers.the story lines are based on the diplomatic protection services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations,it stood out from some of the junk that gets churned by other tv production companies.i do not think that it has been shown on terrestrial tv either,such as sky or freeview,witch is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays,i am sure it would get a large viewing audience.so i hope one day the guys at carlton tv decide to release it on dvd,cheers,nick.
