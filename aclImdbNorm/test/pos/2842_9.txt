a question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: who are the crazy people?<br /><br />the answer become less clear as the film goes on.<br /><br />renee zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked betty. in fact, she is so effective i almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.<br /><br />this is the first time ms zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.<br /><br />chris rock
