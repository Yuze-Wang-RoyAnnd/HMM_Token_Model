i rented this movie not knowing what to expect but whoa was i in for a treat!<br /><br />for anyone who, like myself, was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi, it is time to rejoice because the wait has finally ended. writing, acting, filming and directing - all top notch. i hate to admit it, but i actually cried at one point (when dracula was talking to the crippled guy). truly an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish. the corridors of the ship provided the perfect spooky setting for this tale and the actors were really able to make their fear come alive to me. and coolio as a vampire....very nice!<br /><br />and believe me....as great as the bulk of the movie was...the ending will blow you away! i know this movie gets a lot of flack on this site for some reason but i know none of you saw the ending coming. brilliant!
