i'm 15, usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies. but this is one of my favorites. i was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. it's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time, music is great, storyline is ok,choreography is great, must see it. i don't know why there's a prequel for this movie. not many people like this movie, but i love classic love movies, they're so much better than movies now! this movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. the music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. i haven't seen dirty dancing 2 harvana nights(prequel), prequel should have star the original actors, thats what i hate about prequels, they ruin the original. no one wants a prequel, they want a sequel. many people will agree that for a movie- the original, sequel and the 3rd one is enough. beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it. who remembers the movie about the st benard beethoven? i think there's 5 movies altogether.
