having just seen this, i find it hard to believe that it is not better known. this and the slightly-better-known, but almost-as-shamefully-neglected come and see (klimov, 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. they are meaningful, powerful, incisive. the ascent is also gifted with a sparingly-used, but brilliantly trenchant score by schnittke.
