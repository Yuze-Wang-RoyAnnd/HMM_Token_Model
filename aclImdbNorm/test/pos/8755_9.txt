i remember seeing this in the early 90's on uk tv and was hooked. the international scope of the production is breathtaking and watching how the characters develop through the five hours it runs for is magnificent. the scenes set in pakistan and afghanistan are of particular interest, and as a viewer you get a real sense of a grounds-eye view of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing stages of the cold war. the characters of fazal and helen develop really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like the sopranos and six feet under in this area. in the uk, the vhs goes for about lb6 and the dvd about lb10 - a quality bargain. i thought soderbergh's version was great too - but clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt.
