i am an australian currently living in japan. i saw this movie on tv here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of western and japanese ideologies colliding. whoever wrote the screenplay, and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in japan. the only part i thought was too hollywood-y was when tom selleck's character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience! 9/10
