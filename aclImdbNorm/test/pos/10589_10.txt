this movie kicks ass, bar none. bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film. since i got the dvd (4 days ago) i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it. i can't wait for grind to come out in theaters. if its anything like haggard it will be worth the wait.<br /><br />thanks, jtcellphone
