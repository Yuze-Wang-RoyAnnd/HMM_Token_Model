sensitive, extremely quiet paced love story between a married journalist and his young and atractive neighbor, she too also married. they lived their love for a time but the obstacles and the fear of hurting their families and children invites to a separation. a reflexive look on delicate question like love, friendship, honor and loneliness, always present in human lives, whether you are an american or a chinese. i give this a 7 (seven)
