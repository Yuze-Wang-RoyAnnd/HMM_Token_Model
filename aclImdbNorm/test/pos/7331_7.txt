flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family. it's obviously not a great movie, free willy looks much better almost in every component of film making. possibly, at times it becomes a bit naive , and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie, but it's a entertaining film with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. elijah wood proves himself one more time as an incredibly talented and underrated actor. he can make bad movie watchable, okay movie - good, good - great and great movie becomes all time classic. paul hogan performance also was very good and he is completely fit to his role. as i already say above, whole cinematography was very good. but underwater shots definitely is the best parts. so flipper is a perfect way if you want to see nice, sweet and entertaining movie. if you like me become sick and tired of modern hollywood trash, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity you most likely would like this movie. <br /><br />my rating: 7,7 out of 10. feel free for mailing me about any of my comments and posts here. <br /><br />sorry for my bad english.
