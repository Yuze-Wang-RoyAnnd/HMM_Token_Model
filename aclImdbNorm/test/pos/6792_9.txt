this is a delightful film. elizabeth taylor does a wonderful job, as does mickey rooney. the film just makes you feel happy. it's inspirational, and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental, that is easily forgiven. i could watch this movie again and again. the race at the end is exciting every time i see it. highly recommend this film.
