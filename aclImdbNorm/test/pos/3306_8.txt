great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. great production design, appealing stars, great lines ("miss bender, i don't care if you beat it out on a native drum!", says joan crawford's amanda farrow to hope lange when lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). if you've seen this movie panned and scanned on tv and not in the letterboxed version on pay-tv or amc (american movie classics) you haven't really seen it. hopefully, this guilty pleasure of a film will be made available soon on dvd in a letterboxed version and with it's original 4-track stereophonic soundtrack. great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of 1959 new york while johnny mathis sings the "best of everything" theme song in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of background screamers. miscarriages! insanity! office romance! bitchy cold-hearted bosses! thwarted love! it's all here to enjoy.
