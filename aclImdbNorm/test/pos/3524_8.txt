five teens set out to do some camping in the oregon wilderness, and despite being warned by the park ranger, they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strike.<br /><br />when it comes to old horror movies, the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is friday the 13th, so i took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to friday the 13th, just before dawn just so happened to be among the ones i found, and was really very impressive, it wasn't as bland as some of the stuff you find today, it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones, and it has this very casual pace, its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits, it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like, somethings out there but you don't know where it is or when it will strike.<br /><br />where i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or won't give it a chance, but i'll state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off, the two concepts don't even go near each other, but in my mind, it is overall one of the more impressive slashers i've seen in a while.
