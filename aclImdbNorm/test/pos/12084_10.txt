i was just looking up " who will love my children" to buy, when i came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow briton!! i am a great fan of this movie and would, and have, recommended it to all. what i found comforting is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others. i also have a son with aspergers (amongst other things) and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband, that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful 'normal' daughter, but my special and gifted son also. missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know. living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie. so to all of you reading this, if you have not seen it, make an effort to do so. it is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry, and beg. after that you will count your blessings, and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like , or close to this one, my heart goes out to you. it makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful thing get, just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you. an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. do not be put off by how sad it is, at the same time this movie is heart warming, and makes you feel encouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind.
