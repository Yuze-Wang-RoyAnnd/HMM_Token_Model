andaz apna apna is a movie that i treasure and its one movie, i don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! this movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie i've ever seen! and yes, i do put it over hera pheri... reason? hera pheri has scenes you'll watch out but andaz apna apna? not possible! simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! aamir & salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but i'll put the characters in order of favoritism: <br /><br />rank # 1. crime master gogo (shakti kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of mogambo (mr. india fame). crime master gogo is actually mogambo's nephew but for mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to teja (who is as balla had once said, "a fraud and a cheat!"). now, gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... gogo's struggle against the sinner-world.<br /><br />rank # 2. teja (teja main hoon, mark idhar hai!): teja is an evil character who is ram gopal bajaj's twin. originally named shyam gopal bajaj, teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to ram bajaj. teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed munshi harish chandra (raveena's dad), though teja doesn't regret his actions. teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own poultry & bakery farm. teja also needs to return back the loan to gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). in order to achieve his evil goals, teja employs two people: robert (vijay khote, who is very good at aiming) and balla (shahzad khan, ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) <br /><br />rank # 3. amar (aamir khan): wants to marry the rich heiress raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for mumbai. amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to london, if needed.<br /><br />rank # 4. prem (salman khan): after gogo, prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.<br /><br />i won't reveal any more characters because jesus christ! i just wouldn't stop typing! the movie is outright stunning! go and get the dvd now and beware of those cheap vcds as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.<br /><br />the background music is stud and the action is better than the matrix, especially the final encountered between prem and crime master gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. andaz apna apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. it teaches us about bravery (why else would amar ask prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). andaz apna apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where salman is targeted by aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to london and the part where gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. andaz apna apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!<br /><br />the movie was considered a flop back then and i bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! this movie is a big hit! even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling home dvds and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!
