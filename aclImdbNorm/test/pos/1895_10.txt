if you watch this movie you'll be quoting it and referring to it for a long time to come. it's been years since i saw dolemite and i still quote it to this day. it's a true classic. it is so mind-numbingly awful that it makes a hilarious view. every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing. every wobbly shot a work of art(?). and every punch and kick so woefully executed. you won't believe your eyes. it's all i can say. if i really get into how mesmerizing this movie is i won't be able to stop and i'll go way over the imdb 1000-word limit.<br /><br />please, please watch this movie. you'll be in hysterics. either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
