this movie is a gem...an undiscovered gerry anderson classic.<br /><br />the origins of both "ufo" and "space 1999" are obvious from this movie, including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george sewell who both went onto "ufo".<br /><br />it is unfortunate that anderson, despite his many tv successes, did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen. just think what he could have done with the movie version of "thunderbirds" (which he quite rightly disowned himself from!).<br /><br />i'm sure if you give "jttfsots"/"doppleganger" a fair chance you'll appreciate it's good qualities.
