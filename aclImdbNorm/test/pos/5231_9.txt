the details in the big trail were so incredible that i felt that the movie was made at the time it represents. i have never seen wagons that were so real! they were big, loaded with accessories, and even felt as though they had been filled with details under the canvas covers that was never meant to be seen. every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. modern day computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move across the land or circle to fend off indians. the wagons were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or oxen.<br /><br />the actors clothing could not have felt more genuine. with the exception of john wayne's buckskin outfit and marguerite churchill's nice dress, the clothes were very common looking, tattered, or dirty in an authentic looking way. many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common, and they must have felt comfortable with the surroundings. all the indians were real indians rather than white extras painted tan.<br /><br />women of the old west had to be sturdy because there was a lot of work. in every scene showing work done by the people of the wagon train, women are shown chopping wood, hauling logs, etc. this realism was so natural looking that it did not come across as a statement on the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival.<br /><br />the plot of revenge and romance is played well. nothing is overstated or overplayed.<br /><br />something was lost along the way in the 1930's in hollywood. as much as i love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies, the big trail manages to feel real above all else. the more i see big budget movies of the silent era, the more i like them. i can think of few movies of the 1930's that i have seen that equal the grandeur of the best of the 1920's. if there were home movies made in the days of wagon trains, the big trail is what they would look like.
