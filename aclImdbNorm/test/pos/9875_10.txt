wow, "the curse of michael myers" what a great film. suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a clever plot which i love. many hate the 'thorn' concept, i love it. i think that it gives the halloween series some plot. marianne hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance, especially for her first film and paul rudd and donald pleasence are great also. my only complaint is that why wasn't danielle harris in this film as jamie? she wanted to return, but the producers said no. i thought j.c brandy was great, but i love danielle harris. still, i love halloween: the curse of michael myers. i think the shape's mask looks the best in this film and george p. wilbur is the best michael myers ever. incredibly creepy and suspenseful, halloween 6 rules! <br /><br />i adore this very violent, but immensely enjoyable film. the halloween horror series - by far the best in the genre.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
