with the nazi rise to power in eastern europe in the late 1930's, charles chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. the catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to chaplin as a jewish sympathizer. in the great dictator, chaplin created a dead-on parody of hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. the film traces hitler's experiences in the german army from world war i up to the present day. simultaneously, chaplin plays a jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under nazi rule.<br /><br />paulette goddard, chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a jewish ghetto. jack oakie has a great, oscar-nominated supporting role as a mussolini look-alike (benzini napaloni) who gives chaplin's hitler character, adenoid hynkel, a lot of fits. henry daniell is his usual staid self as garbitsch, chief adviser to adenoid hynkel. chaplin wrote and directed the film and received oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. the film was also nominated for best picture.<br /><br />chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. he financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding nazi germany up to that time. the film spent about twenty-one months in production with chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. by the time of the film's release in october of 1940, the war in europe was well under way with hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.<br /><br />there isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between hynkel and napaloni. the scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. likewise, the escape of both the barber and schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for hynkel in order to give chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. on the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of aryan superiority than to have a jewish barber mistaken for hynkel? <br /><br />still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between hynkel and napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. one can also not forget the risks chaplin took in making his first talking film, an anti-nazi film, and financing the film himself. ***1/2 of 4 stars.
