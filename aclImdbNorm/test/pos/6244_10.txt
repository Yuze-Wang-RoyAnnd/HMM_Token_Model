this is the single greatest movie i have ever seen. davey/mr. slaussen is simultaneously:<br /><br />1) tortured about his talents (e.g., "i can control it; i can! i shouldn't have to hiiiide it! it feeeeeeeeeels good!");<br /><br />2) desperate to make friends, e.g.,<br /><br />"how's the soup?<br /><br />"the soup is very good."<br /><br />"would you like some crackers with your soup?"<br /><br />"i'd like some more crackers, please."<br /><br />"how's that?"<br /><br />"yes, the soup is very good."<br /><br />3) proud of his accomplishments (e.g. "pretty neat trick, huh?")<br /><br />4) a ladies man (e.g., "you're so pretty. why don't you like me?"); and<br /><br />5) sometimes, very, very angry (e.g., "you can't get away!")<br /><br />connors should have received an academy award for best actor for this movie. i mean, who was possibly better?! tanya roberts rocketed to the stratosphere following her performance in tt. it's a wonder not all of the stars of this masterpiece did not go on to have brilliant careers. i highly, highly recommend this film! it's available on amazon.com. everyone should own it. make a night of it and have a bowl of soup while you watch.
