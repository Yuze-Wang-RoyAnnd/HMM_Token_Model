my opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases. i tend to lean toward the artsy, imaginative, and different. this movie was reminiscent of frances ford's "the black stallion" wherein a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature who's not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these multitudes of documentaries ala natural. unlike those nature films, this offering utilizes the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a diva creating one of the most sensual super stars (the cat) on the screen.<br /><br />this fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier (he is very nice too) lost on the egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned egyptian temple is mesmerizing. i bought into it wholeheartedly. if you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should enjoy it.<br /><br />the only flaw in my book was the ending. it was a perfect set up for a romeo and juliet finale - that would have taken me over the top.<br /><br />
