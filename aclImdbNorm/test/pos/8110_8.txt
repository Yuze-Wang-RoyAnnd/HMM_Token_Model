hynkel, dictator of tomania, is a spoiled child who becomes angry when he cannot gets what he really wants... and what he simply wants is nothing less than the world...<br /><br />in one of the extraordinary scenes of chaplin art, hynkel performs a ballet with the 'world' which bursts when he thinks he has it in his grasp...<br /><br />chaplin also has some biting words on war and war films... in a scene at the beginning of the movie, which takes place during world war i, the tomanian messenger crashes the plane and thinks... he is about to die... in a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words... the empty double-talk continue ascending into a brilliant take off on all the heroic death scenes of war films...<br /><br />in another scene when he becomes a fugitive in the jewish ghetto and assumes command of the resistance fomenting rebellion among the old men, he plans to kill the dictator... one of the group must kill the ruthless conqueror of austerlich... whoever is chosen will naturally die, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in tomanian history...<br /><br />the sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which shall sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear...<br /><br />for all its disappointing shortcomings, "the great dictator" is still a significant movie for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither chaplin nor anymore else could have given it: the irony of history... the necessity to murder hynkel presages the assassination attempt against hitler by his generals... the force of the original satire is only surpassed by history's imitation of art...<br /><br />with a splendid sequence like the duck-shooting accident which leads to the dictator being mistaken for the humbly jewish barber and vice versa, "the great dictator" is chaplin's first talking movie... this time 'charles' and not 'charlie,' wanting to say more through his movie and not through an amusing comedy, the last in which he uses his celebrated 'tramp character.'
