an assassination thriller in the mould of day of the jackal, in the line of fire has the added twist that eastwood's old-timer bodyguard frank horrigan is troubled by past failure on the job. the chase becomes personal as john malkovich's reptilian assassin leary taunts him over this neurosis - with the rather clunky exception of the love of a good woman (russo's lilly raines) nothing's going to set frank's mind at rest than taking leary down personally.<br /><br />malkovich is a volatile presence - not simply combustible on screen but often a changeable actor too. this is one of his good films, focused and playing director petersen's game. eastwood is too old but a) the audience don't care, cos it's him and b) his age is written into the script, not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke. pretty much as you'd expect but well-handled. 7/10
