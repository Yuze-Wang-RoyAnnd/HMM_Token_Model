best fan boy movie i've ever watched save "free enterprise."<br /><br />in some ways it reminded me of an early kevin smith film.<br /><br />if you do any kind of role playing, this movie will likely have you laughing often at its insatiable fun. don't expect a big budget here, the acting is also questionable at times, but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create. the script is truly humorous with a lot of witty moments worth experiencing.<br /><br />the bard that always gets killed had me rolling. the sexually confused player also had me smiling a bit too. but in the end... it was just a great movie showcasing some better moments in the lives of a few geeks having a great time with role playing.<br /><br />if you are bored, and ever got into role playing, this will do nicely for a distraction. a real unexpected treat.
