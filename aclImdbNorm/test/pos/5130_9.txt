hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message. it seemed like that this film was for young children, but i know that adults will like this film. the storyline is pretty simple. a kid who moved to florida must help a soccer jock and an outcast save burrowing owls from construction of a pancake house. the message in this film is big especially for animal activists and lovers. the message is about doing all you can to save endangered animals. the acting in this film is decent. all the three kids looked like they had good chemistry. the music is not too shabby. i liked jimmy buffet's songs in this film. overall this is a good family film. i rate this film a 9/10.
