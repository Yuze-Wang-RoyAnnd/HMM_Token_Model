i had no idea what i was going to see when i decided to view this film and to my surprise its just an extremely well made horror film that is easily one of the best of the 1970's. film is of course low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of a film creates chills, not special effects! strother martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he has a rare starring role here and the film also stars martins good friend l.q. jones and "green acres" alvy moore. jones and moore helped produce this film as well. tv veteran charles bateman is the star and "enter the dragon" beauty ahna capri is his girlfriend. capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she's just gorgeous to look at! film does a terrific job of staying with the story and not adding a phony feel good ending and i really liked the way the film ends. great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by bernard mceveety. martins performance is top notch also as he doesn't hold back at all and really throws himself into the role of doc. good and underrated film!
