i really liked the movie, thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic. but i just had a question about the music is the movie. i haven't been able to find any kind of soundtrack(if there even is one). and specifically ,i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to new orleans? i thought it was something along the lines of "my great escape", but i've searched on the internet, books, pretty much everything i could think of to try to, and i just can't find it anywhere. if someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated. thanks.
