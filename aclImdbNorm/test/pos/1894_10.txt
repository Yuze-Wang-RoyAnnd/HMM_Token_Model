i find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic, and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. but i admire the courage to throw away a script, turn the camera on, and act a fool. i find the inauspiciously performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and whatever film school laws d' urville martin broke funny. speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. this film looks like fun. when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore. they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen, scorsese, lucas, capra? i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first.
