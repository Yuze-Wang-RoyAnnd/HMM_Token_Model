"curse of monkey island" is a treasure; in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure gaming, not to mention lucasarts.<br /><br />but to return to "curse," whats beautiful about cmi is that its not afraid to be itself. it does deviate from the first two but still remains faithful to the ron gilbert productions (if only the same could be said about the 4th installment of the series!). the voice work is impeccable, with dominic armato playing our favorite protagonist guybrush threepwood. the animation, while quite different than the classic pixelated characters, is done beautifully. it really is just absolutely gorgeous. and the music is fantastic! its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off.<br /><br />although i'm not too big a fan of romance, the romantic scenes and themes are not at all overpowering. they also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy. that says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chick flicks.<br /><br />then, of course, is the classic mi element of humor. cmi is quite adept at delivering deadpan lines, altogether absurdist humor, and simply good fun. gary coleman makes a cameo as a budding young entrepreneur, and world events are discreetly jabbed at without stepping out of the bounds of the game.<br /><br />its not entirely fair to compare cmi to mi and mi2 because it truly is in a realm of its own. personally i can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other. however, if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flair of the classic series, i insist you give this game a shot. you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />10/10 stars, hands down.<br /><br />- emily n
