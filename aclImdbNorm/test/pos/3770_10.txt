a mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. as i've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... classic lines such as (parapharsed) "i've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times i do it. you're a nurse, what can you give me for it?" nurse replies "all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..." great sound track.the classic "hyde's got nothing to hide". stays surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original stays in the way of a joke..... haven't met anyone with an iq over 115 that doesn't find it hysterical.<br /><br />
