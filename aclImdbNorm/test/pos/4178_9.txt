for a long time, i, a fan of "the monkees" tv series, refused to watch "head" because it was not about the tv show characters, who were warm and wonderful. "head", instead, was said to be a cynical, dark movie. finally, curiosity caused me to cave in. i didn't, of course, find a new episode to the tv show, but a fascinating movie that appeals to my dark side.<br /><br />i have always been fascinated by dreams, and "head" was very much like watching someone else's dream, with incomplete hints of stories, and a small detail at the end of one scene causing the film to segue off in a new direction, very much in a dreamlike stream of consciousness manner. the unfinished stories really make my imagination run wild, time and time again!<br /><br />the film also features very striking, beautiful cinematography, the epitome being the black-on-white, white-on-black look of "daddy's song". the music is haunting, especially the lush arrangement of "the porpoise song". ("the porpoise song" is the favorite song of my dark side, while my bright side prefers "zip-a-dee-doo-dah".)<br /><br />in the end, i think the tv series could have used some of "head"'s drama, intrigue, and intensity. but "head" could have used some of the tv show's warmth, humor, and friendship.
