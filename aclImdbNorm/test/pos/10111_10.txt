the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the east has been dismal. this film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.<br /><br />it is well photographed and the sound is superb. viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or dts enabled sound system is recommended. obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then i wouldn't bother with this. dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.<br /><br />it is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences. i would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. the ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. the plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.<br /><br />if i do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring. we have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge "pleasure" from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic.
