"idiocracy" is the latest film to come from mike "office space" judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity... relatively speaking. it is a story about joe bauer (luke wilson), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. joe, and a prostitute named rita (maya rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. they were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, joe and rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future.<br /><br />here's the scary part: this film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 became absolutely retarded. with no natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the quickest, smartest, and strongest people for progression of genes... just the people who breed the most. unfortunately, those people happen to be welfare-sucking, trailer trash idiots who breed like rabbits. this abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused an adverse effect on societal growth and now joe and rita are the two smartest human beings on the face of the planet. if it helps, imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. seeing this nightmarish dystopia, joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and rita can get back to when they came from, and that's basically the whole plot.<br /><br />but despite how one-dimensional i may make it sound, this movie is higher brow than you can fathom. nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses (warning signs, if you will) of modern day dumb-ciety permeating facets of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in "idiocracy." the film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. i don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say that it is pretty thorough. i can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor, but it, odd as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how dumb and crass these people are.<br /><br />this film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "office space"; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome/funny movie when it comes out on video. my only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a hitchhiker's-guide-to-the-galaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are, but it is a necessary evil and is implemented better here. other than that, good characters, funny jokes, and better-than-average social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow.<br /><br />final note: if seeing our youth becoming gang-banger wanna-be's, acting like redneck/ ghetto trash and being proud of it... if you are educated and cultured in anyway and can see how our country is spiraling out of control into an abyss of stupidity, for god sakes, watch this movie.
