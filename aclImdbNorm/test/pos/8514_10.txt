like most people out there who have watched james bond 007 movies. most people never knew that thunderball was originally the first 007 movie to be released, but after ian fleming, wrote the story with kevin mcclory and jack whittingham. the 2 other authors took ian fleming to court and won the case providing evidence that ian fleming took the ideas of spectre(special executive in counterintelligence terrorism revenge extortion). so rather than making thunderball they(fleming,broccoli,saltzman) went on to make dr no.<br /><br />this movie had the best of the best, from getting sean connery to come back one more time, he was paid over 5,000,000 for nsna. irvin kershner and sean connery had problems on the set, that much is true. but overall this movie was up there i think with(thunderball, licence to kill, dr no) those are my favorite from the bond series. david dryer was hired for special photographic effects, he was working at the time on bladerunner before never say never again. the 100 million dollar yacht makes the disco volante, look like a canoe. this movie starred the best villian in a bond movie just behind dr no. klaus maria brandeau held together this neurotic business like calm manner, with a little wit to his authority over bond. barbara carrera was excellent as fatima blush.<br /><br />the music was better than every score that didnt contain john barry doing the backround score music in most bond films. michel legrand is not big in the usa compared to over in europe, he has played with miles davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years. its a little bland at times but the 007 theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in the movie never say never again is so cool, i like it more than the original.<br /><br />007 is back one more time<br /><br />timothy dalton explained it right i thought, you cant relate to a superman or a superhero, he or she has to be human and have feelings. he was by far the best serious true to flemings version of bond. but sean connery proves he can still do the role that made him and others to follow, i bet at 75 now he could still pull off a villian role in a mcclory 007 movie if one ever surfaces.<br /><br />
