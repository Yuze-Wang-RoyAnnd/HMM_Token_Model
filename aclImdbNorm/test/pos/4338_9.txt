this is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still i enjoyed it. this time, charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. death wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and i enjoyed it every single second of it. director michael winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and jimmy page providing the music, with producers golan and globus still doing there thing and charles bronson is still acting good for paul kersey. this movie also made it look like that michael try to end the death wish series and i can't blame him and i love the gun that charles uses. death wish 3 is one of the great movies of 1985 and can't get any better than this.<br /><br />i gives this 9/10
