i had the privilege of being one of the still photographers on the set of "grand champion" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days i worked on the movie. i have been in the photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and i can't think of a time when i enjoyed providing my craft more. the kids were wonderful to work with and little emma roberts has so much energy she's a real trip. she even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. some of her images were used for pr. i could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget but i doubt i would have had the fun and been around so many great actors and the great people of west texas as i was.
