hoppity is a charming if slightly phycadelic animated movie that considering it was made in the 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well. now i have to admit i have a soft spot for 'hoppitygoes to town' (as it is called in the united kingdom) having watched a vhs version taped of the tv by our parents many times with my siblings.imagine my surprise when i woke up this morning just in time to catch it on channel four (at 0615 never the less!) the film was just as delightful as i remembered it with the animation standing the test of time and a lovely moral tale which should appeal to parents and children alike. maybe one day i to shall share this forgotten classic with children of my own. with a nice running time for kids (88 min's)and a simple yet involving storyline there really is something for everyone in this tale of the little guy coming good. i really could see this being successfully remade in cgi. take note pixar.
