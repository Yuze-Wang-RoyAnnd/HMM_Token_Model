i love this show. i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again!! i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see's casey his sister to now where he's dating dana.. love this show cant wait until monday night!! also i am so glad that cappie and casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy!!! as for evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale. i just looked it up about the main part of the cast and i am so shocked that casey cartwright(spencer grammar)is kelsey grammar's daughter!!! that just surprises me so much and the other thing that's a huge shocker is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born on my baby brother birth date with my year and i had been watching her the whole entire time and had no clue!!
