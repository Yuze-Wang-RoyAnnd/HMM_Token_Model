alfred hitchcock's remake of "the man who who knew too much," is usually not considered to be as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films ever. i prefer it over "vertigo" and "rear window."<br /><br />like "north by northwest," it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue. james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family.<br /><br />while the original was good for it's time, it is hard to watch by today's standards. the remake has excellent production quality, an endearing doris day, and a really creepy villain. <br /><br />don't bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over.
