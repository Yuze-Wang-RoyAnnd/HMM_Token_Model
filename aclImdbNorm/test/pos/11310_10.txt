"medusa: dare to be truthful" is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original, "madonna: truth or dare". julie brown's brilliant creation skewers madonna's highly entertaining documentary (although it wasn't exactly daring, insightful, candid, or truthful) with a faithfulness to detail, right down to the packaging. i highly recommend this for madonna fans, julie brown fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody.
