just watched this movie over the weekend, and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it. the 2 italo american actors are excellent as usual (michael imperioli and john ventimiglia). it is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by italians. primarily he was influenced by dino risi and his film il sorpasso. it is the story of 2 young men who meet by chance and become friends. one is extroverted and the other is introverted. they enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day, the shy one learns that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony. the same thing happens to albert de santi. unfortunately, il sorpasso has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of on the run because he uses the same technique but with a twist. i had expected something but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite. if you watch both movies you will understand. the other film that influenced the director is after hours directed by the great italian american scorsese. i highly recommend all 3 movies !!
