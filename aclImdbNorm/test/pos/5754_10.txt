i own this movie on dvd and i have watched it about 10 times and it's still funny. the jokes will never get boring and i often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them. the premise is that richard and eddie of bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in britain next to a nuclear power plant. they are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in.<br /><br />to watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour. some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. but overall it's a great movie.
