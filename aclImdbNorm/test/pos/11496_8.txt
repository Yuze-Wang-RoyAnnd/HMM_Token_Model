this movie could be likened to "comfort food" for the soul. anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie. so many parts of it are so hilarious and so many parts are so heartbreakingly true. it's not perfect in its production or even its dialog, but the story is unique which is saying a lot for modern "romantic" comedies. luke wilson is bland at best, but heather graham does an exceptional job in my opinion. give it a try - despite the trite looking dvd cover.the character of joline brings a lot of issues up in our culture of self-service. she asks us if commitment is really for the other person or ourselves. truly, it is ourselves. following through on promises (anywhere from marriage to an errand for a friend) is a great feeling. anymore, our word is nothing but a shapeshifting puff of smoke. joline is like a wake-up call. we must be conscious of our words and commitments, they mean more than we think. at the same time, we must not commit to someone who is incapable of doing the same.
