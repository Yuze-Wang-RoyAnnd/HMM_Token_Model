large corporations vs. conscientious do good-ers. we seem to witness events (both real life and reel life) of this sort all the time and most of the time greed wins by employing every means (dirty) necessary and the truth gets suppressed. at least in this movie jack godell (jack lemmon) got his points across and paid for it dearly. we have seen several more movies of this sort being made in the recent years, the most memorable of which was 'the insider' where russell crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to blow the whistle claiming that the industry added more nicotine in cigarettes to make smokers addicted. there was also this reporter-protagonist angle where the reporter is looking for the scoop of his/her dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he/she has to choose between righteousness and his livelihood and sometimes his/her life.<br /><br />jane fonda played reporter kimberly wells to perfection. she plays a reporter who wishes to pursue serious news whereas her bosses value her more as an 'eye-candy'. she and her crew (the cameraman played by post-'coma' michael douglas who is also the producer of the movie) witness an accident in a nuclear power plant while they were on a visit. cameraman michael douglas sneakily/illegally gets footage of that event on tape in spite being a no-photography zone and smuggles it out of the station. the station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station. <br /><br />in the mean time the chief engineer jack godell launches an investigation of his own and discovers a lot of irregularities in the equipment that's being used for the reactor. this starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed.<br /><br />this is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience till the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments. now that's great and unusual in movies. performances were all good and i love jack lemmon. we primarily know him for his comedic roles but he is equally good in dramatic roles. i give this movie an 8/10.
