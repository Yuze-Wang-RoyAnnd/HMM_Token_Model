all i have to say is that this movie is the bomb. you are going to cry when you see this. i mean, this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. it reminds you of the days during your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss. even though i am still a teen, this is how i live my life. when i am with that certain someone, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. so, i give this movie a 10 for it's heartfelt message and touching plot. actors josh hartnett and chris klein i also give a 10 for having a cute face.
