this, without any doubt, is the greatest spin off to jackass ever made, hell, it even blows jackass out of the water.<br /><br />picture this: you have a group of guys who just didn't want to grow up, throw in a ton of money, and some seriously cool stunts, and you have viva la bam.<br /><br />this show, it's such a family-based one, and it's not just "the gang" running around being complete jerks (like in jackass). for example: bam's parents, april and phil, are in every episode, with appearances of bam's obese uncle, don vito to boot! the reason why the margera family makes us laugh is simple: somebody in our family can relate. april: the woman who wants to live life by the book and follow tradition. phil: the guy who tries to be a good father, and finally, bam: that son that never grew out of high school.<br /><br />the pranks and jokes in every episode will give you a guaranteed laugh, and buying the dvds is definitely recommended! another thing which is surprising to see, is how casual margera is over the whole thing. he's said in interviews that for the majority of episodes, he isn't acting, and is just acting off instinct.<br /><br />what i liked the most about the whole thing, however, is the amount of influence margera has over mtv. he wanted slayer to play in his backyard, mtv did it. he wanted to hang with dani filth for a day and have a cradle of filth concert in his backyard, it happened.<br /><br />add to this his passion for the love-metal (and debated as emo) band h.i.m and his brother's garage band cky, and there's a whole lot of head banging going on.<br /><br />if you liked jackass, you'll fall in love with this. i borrowed season 1 from a friend last year, and i would give up my legs to meet the viva la bam crew. you will not be disappointed, and i can promise you'll be in stitches by the end of it all!
