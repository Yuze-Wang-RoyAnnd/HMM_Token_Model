i am not a golf fan by any means. on may 26 about 10:30 pm the movie started with a scene in the late 1800's. old movies i like but not golf however, within the first scene a young boy (harry vardon) is awaken by the voices of men. he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... so , then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. the movie is excellent. we then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf. you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning. don't want to give away too much . i was up until 2 a.m. this is super please see the movie.
