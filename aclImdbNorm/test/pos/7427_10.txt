this movie is a hidden gem. i can't understand why this movie doesn't get more air time. errol and eleanor parker make for a real attractive and dashing couple. and their chemistry is impeccable. i really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her robin hood. i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys errol flynn. it's nice to see errol playing a father as well. by all accounts from his very own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. also, the supporting cast is wonderful as well. you can't go wrong with supporting players such as hattie mcdaniel and lucile watson. hattie mcdaniel makes a movie that much better from the get-go. this movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home. enjoy!!!
