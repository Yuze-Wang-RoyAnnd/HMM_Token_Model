adapting his own novel "cabal" for the screen, author / screenwriter / director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outr'e horror and fantasy. craig sheffer plays boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. the cops gun him down in front of midian, on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society. when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everybody, including boone's sweet girlfriend (the very cute anne bobby) and dubious psychiatrist (a most enjoyable david cronenberg).<br /><br />"nightbreed" displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i don't see in movies all that often. for one thing, ralph mcquarrie, an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three "star wars" entries, helps barker to create excellent visuals for "nightbreed", starting right away with the opening credit sequence. the visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. it's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. and of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions.<br /><br />great supporting performances add to the fun. cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while charles haid is a fine love-to-hate-him type of antagonist, a rather nasty police captain. doug "pinhead" bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. hugh ross is great fun as narcisse, as is catherine chevalier as rachel (as an added bonus, she bares her breasts in one sequence). simon bamford, who played the "butterball cenobite" in the first two "hellraiser" pictures, turns up here as well. there's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci-fi star john agar.<br /><br />danny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores, and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown.<br /><br />"nightbreed" is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it. i give it a hearty recommendation.<br /><br />9/10
