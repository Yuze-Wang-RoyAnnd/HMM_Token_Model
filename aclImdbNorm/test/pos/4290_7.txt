separate lies changed my life. actually, the q&a did.<br /><br />spoilers below. read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:<br /><br />the emily watson character cheats on the tom wilkonson character. my first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed emily was "it's over. dump her. bad riddance." for some reason, he stuck around. not in a pathetic way. he just listened. and tried to accept her needs. at times he needed to leave. but he stuck by her and let her live her life. but i still wanted to see her <br /><br />afterwards, julian, the screenwriter and director, talked about the film. i'm glad he did, because frankly i am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me. <br /><br />tom's character loved her, and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what he wants, he would always love her. the relationship and love they shared wasn't a lie, all of a sudden, just because she wanted to be with someone else. the fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was. when you get past fifty, there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again, so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger. you have to try and make things work, because the alternative may be much worse.<br /><br />she needed what she needed, and she couldn't help that. he had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be. he helped her in pursuit of her lover, even when it hurt him.<br /><br />another thing: julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is guilt. <br /><br />again: the strongest tool of a controller is guilt.<br /><br />at the end of the film, tom released her from her burden. he felt a need to let her know that he loved her, but not to in order to get her back; he wanted to let her know she didn't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way.<br /><br />it is not my way to review a film based on the message, rather than the execution, especially when i understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director, but i make an exception here, as i feel one more mature than i would benefit from seeing the film.<br /><br />the execution of the film-making was a nice, british pace. rupert was slimy and revolting. tom and emily were their usually solid, real characters.
