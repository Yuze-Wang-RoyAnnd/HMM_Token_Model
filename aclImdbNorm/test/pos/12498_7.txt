i'm torn about this show. while most parts of it i found to be hilarious, other parts of it i found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake. the off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children. however, i don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things. it's not that i think "oh poor children, they're being exploited" - it's just that it's really not clever!! it's something that anyone could do, therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane. in order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children, which i think can be funnier than the scripted at time. <br /><br />by far the funniest part of wonder showzen is clarence, the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers. it's really funny and it's mostly improvised. seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an extremely patient man, was by far the funniest scene in my opinion. <br /><br />you should watch this show though because all in all it's very funny, even if it is stupid at times.
