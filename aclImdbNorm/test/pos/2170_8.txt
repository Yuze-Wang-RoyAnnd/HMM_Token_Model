this movie was better than i expected. i don't think it deserved an r rating, though. i've seen pg-13 films with worse language and violence. i found this movie entertaining and i enjoyed it. if you're a person who dissects everything, you might find a lot wrong with it, but if you take it for its face value, i think you'll find it entertaining.
