it's true that this is not realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre that i look to for realism. what counts is that the characters are likeable and, as needed, sexy. shalom is beautiful and relaxed and jake weber is handsome in an offhand kind of way. they have enough chemistry to make the story believable in the area that counts, sexual attraction. i would love to see either of them in another movie. and yes, the clown is pretty cute too.
