i originally saw this movie in a movie theater on times square in the late eighties. who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following.night of the demons was like most other films that came out at the time.a group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways.come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by saw ii that i recently saw.<br /><br />i saw mimi kinkade at a fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted!i guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks.anyway, i just this film again on vhs cassette and this movie still holds up.a little slow at the beginning as i remembered when i first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace. one of the eighties horror classics and worth a look!
