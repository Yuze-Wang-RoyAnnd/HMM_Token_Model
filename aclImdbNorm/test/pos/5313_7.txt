after stabbing a retarded boy, the fifteen years old troubled and pessimist leland p. fitzgerald (ryan gosling) is sent to a juvenile detention. his teacher and aspirant writer pearl madison (don cheadle) gets close and tries to understand him, first with intention of writing a book, and later becoming his friend. leland slowly discloses his sad vision of world, showing that he is a sociopath.<br /><br />"the united states of leland" is a depressive and interesting study of a character. the low paced riveting screenplay discloses pieces of the story like a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogs; the performances are great, although the twenty-three years old ryan gosling does not convince as a fifteen years old teenager; but it seems that a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make "the united states of leland" an unforgettable movie. the disappointing clarification of the "why" for the violent action of leland against ryan pollard is not convincing or touching, indeed shows that this character is a totally deranged sociopath with a weird and sick sight of world. further, the way allen harris gets pearl's knife is ridiculous. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o mundo de leland" ("the world of leland")
