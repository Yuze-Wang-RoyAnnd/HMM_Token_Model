"the man who knew too much" falls into that hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: not a masterpiece of suspense by any means, but an awful lot of fun nonetheless.<br /><br />james stewart and doris day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue. the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert, where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score. the impish hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is, so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist.<br /><br />so much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy "foul play" that i have to believe that film was inspired by this. neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy.<br /><br />grade: b+
