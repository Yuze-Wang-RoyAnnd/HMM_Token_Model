an introspective look at the relationship between hawking and the space/time contingent. this film expores the gallilean and newtonian laws and there relation to einstein's theory of general relativity.<br /><br />the film is methodically directed, exposing details of the man (hawking) as well as his work (black holes). interviews with his family are a little too long so sadly there is less development of his theories and ideas. <br /><br />a philip glass soundtrack superbly compliments the film. only one other man could compose such haunting instellar melodies (jean michel jarre).<br /><br />overall i would highly recommend this movie on the basis of hawking's 'nuggets of wisdom' and his adequate explanation of an event horizon!
