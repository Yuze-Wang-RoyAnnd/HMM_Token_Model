oss 117 was fun from start to finish.<br /><br />it's difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not, and i won't try to analyze such perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)!<br /><br />everything is old fashioned here, from women's clothes (sigh!), mambo dance, the "hero singing"... ("bambino" sounds like an italian canzonetta sung in... arabic :)!).<br /><br />hubert is physically imposing, but dumb as hell. from all the 007s, he looks like sean connery, but is definitely more sympa because he's... silly, speaks his mind all the time, giggles, even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him. in short, as an anti hero, he rocks :)! sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. <br /><br />b'er'enice bejo is the true queen of the film. graceful, treacherous but with ideals. aure atika, to the contrary, is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts. it's surprising to see her that "sexy bomb", thou.<br /><br />you just can't compare it with "austin powers"! i agree with amazon's d. hartley (seattle, wa) on it being respectful to the genre.<br /><br />which is your favourite scene? one of my favourite scenes is the "fight of the chickens" with the masked villain. but the truly perfect one is when chatting at the cocktail with his contacts, how they all mutter platitudes with confidence... this scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile.
