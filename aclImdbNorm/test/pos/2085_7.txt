zachary scott does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in "danger signal," a 1945 b movie also starring faye emerson, mona freeman, and rosemary decamp. scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. on the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the fenchurch family, hilda (emerson) and her mother (mary servoss). scott throws himself at emerson, and she's dazzled. mid-romance, her younger sister anne (freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. when she mentions that she was uncle wade's favorite and he left her $25,000 (big bucks by 1945 standards), scott loses interest in poor hilda and makes a play for anne. anne looks like rebecca of sunnybrook farm until she starts sneaking around with scott - overnight, she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister. finally getting the message that her tenant is no good, hilda calls in a psychiatrist (rosemary decamp) to psyche him out and advise her.<br /><br />psychological dramas were all the rage during and after world war ii, and scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath. this was his forte - as a weak-willed sheriff in "flamingo road," he exhibited no real presence. as for two-timing, we saw him do that in "mildred pierce," where he proved himself particularly good at it. emerson is a bookish stenographer with her hair pushed off her face and her big glasses, but after hours, she's lovely, and gives a strong performance. decamp was always an underrated actress - here, she sports a soft german accent and is delightful.<br /><br />this is a highly entertaining film though a very routine story. the acting truly elevates it.
