the always delightful kevin spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives. after driving us into believing he is a mumbling small time crook (only to expose the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic the usual suspect; this time around he leads us into believing he is prot, a likable alien who assumes a human form whilst strolling around the earth.<br /><br />prot is a peculiar stranger who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere, only to be hospitalized in the manhattan psychiatric institution. dr. mark powell (jeff bridges) soon takes extreme interest in him, and even finds himself pondering if prot is actually a supreme being from planet k-pax, or perhaps he is only a forgotten human being with severe psychiatric issues. while the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex, enlightening journey which leaves a gr eat deal of intriguing/philosophical questions behind it.
