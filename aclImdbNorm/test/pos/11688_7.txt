if you liked this movie, be sure to check out others directed by hrebejk - you are in for a treat. this is unfortunately not his best, but still million times better than an average movie from the mainstream cinema. it explores relationships, especially the abusive ones, has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting. some plot inconsistencies, clich'es and hollow moments spoil the overall effect. to the previous reviewer and his comments on the czech psyche: an interesting approach, but i do not see this movie becoming a czech blockbuster. those folks are rather spoiled by their movie makers {check out also stuff by sverak, gedeon} and this one lags a bit behind.
