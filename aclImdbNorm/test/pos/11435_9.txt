when i went to the cinema, i expected not much. i knew nothing about this movie but it was the only movie i could see, 'cause i was in a small town then. so i saw this movie and i was fascinated! "la stelle che non c'`e" is a trip through the new industrial china and it shows it honestly! you see most of the time the ugly places of china, and you see what really happens with this new industrializing. the main characters are sad but hopefully people. he's the naive italian guy who can't believe what he see's. she's a translator from china who's missing her son. sometimes sad, sometimes funny but every time poetic! a wonderful movie with wonderful actors! so only one star is missing!
