not a larry mcmurty masterpiece but it stands on its own as a good western, any of the lonesome doves do. who ever takes on the role of woodrow call, does a great portrayal in their own style. it's also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the t.v series (both version of it) and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive william peterson was awesome in this, the geeky c.s.i guy is not the character he plays in this - this guy can do it all it seems<br /><br />it's deserve to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns<br /><br />4out5 stars
