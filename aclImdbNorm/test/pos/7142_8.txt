the 1990s film with anthony hopkins and debra winger is rightly showered with praise, and i enjoyed it very much, but this tv original is just as good, and in some ways, more appropriately cast. claire bloom isn't a brash joy, but she is still confident and throwing her cap at her favourite author (played by joss ackland in one of his best performances).<br /><br />quieter, calmer, and less emotional than the attenborough film this may be, but it does justice to what is a marvellous play full of meaningful dialogue. you'll still cry to this version, but perhaps you won't have the musical prompts to set you off.<br /><br />there's room for both - and having seen this on stage, i would say that the ackland/bloom one is slightly more faithful. but they're both excellent.
