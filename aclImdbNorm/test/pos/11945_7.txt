this movie is sort of similar to "better off dead" as it has some of the same stars. this one though isn't quite as good. granted it is rather funny and enjoyable, there is something about "better...that i like, well better. this one has these guys going to nantucket to spend there summer vacation. while there they meet this girl who's trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant. this guy really doesn't seem to like lobsters, cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream. the main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant. somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown, kind of like in "summer rental" though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better. though what is the deal with boat races at this time? was there some weird fascination with them? for the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip, but "better off dead" was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better.
