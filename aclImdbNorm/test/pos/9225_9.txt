rainbow brite and the star stealer, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. i felt all warm and tingly when rainbow brite (voice of bettina) and krys (voice of david mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of rhonad aldrich). if you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. to me, she deserved to have rainbow brite and krys seek revenge on him. however, i liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. in addition, i thought that lurky (voiec of pat fraley) and murky (voiec of peter cullen) were diabolical. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and disney has scored a big hit. in conclusion, i highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasn't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the tv series. i guarantee you you'll enjoy it.
