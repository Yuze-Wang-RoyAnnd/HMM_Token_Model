having read the other comment about this superb piece of tv drama i felt compelled to balance things a little. if you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be british, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. ken stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including edward woodward and art malik. recommended. (in response to the earlier comments, although i accept that 'red' would not 'normally' drive away from a hit and run, he had just witnessed his brother arrested for murder, and i am fairly sure he does not see the boy move.)
