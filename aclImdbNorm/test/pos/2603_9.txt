the four signs on the road say "if you're looking for fun.....you don't need a reason....all you need is a gun....it's rabbit season!"<br /><br />in the woods, we see hundreds of "rabbit season" signs posted on every tree. we see more and more signs pointing exactly to bugs bunny's hole. who's putting up all these signs? daffy duck!<br /><br />daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, "awfully unsporting of me, i know. but, what the hey - i gotta have some fun! besides, it's really duck season."<br /><br />from that point, we now see elmer fudd, shotgun in hand.....and a war of semantics between bugs and daffy with bugs winning every time. only in cartoons, thankfully, can we see someone getting shotgun-blasted in the head five times and keep going!
