i was at the world premier of this movie, and have even met todd a couples times around town (once at olive garden). todd isn't a bad guy, he is just a small time film maker with little to no budget and big dreams.<br /><br />as for the movie, it is good if you like zombie films with very little plot and lots of blood and guts. you get to see some kansas city locations and lots of raw meat, what could be better? :-) look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (with just a change of clothes or hats). you can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a shot whenever you see the same zombie in a different shirt.
