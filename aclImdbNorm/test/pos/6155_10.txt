i saw this film in wales in july. it deals with the courage of czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the raf after their country had been occupied by the nazis. in this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950's when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in czeckoslavakia and during world war ii in britain. they were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of czeckoslavakia. the pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against nazi pilots. this film contain a love sub-plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. the end of this film indicates that the heroism of these czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990's after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as czeckoslavakia. this powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the czech government. i highly recommend this film.
