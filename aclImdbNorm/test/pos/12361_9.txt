the last person who dies before new years, is cursed to drive the phantom carriage for a whole year, picking up the souls of the dead.<br /><br />i saw a scene from this old silent swedish horror film on youtube, and decided to track down the whole movie. it was well worth the work finding it, because it's an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made. it has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere. the old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. sadly, many of today's film makers don't seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are, and go for the cheap jump scares. the visual effects are excellent, considering its date of production. if you can find a copy of this, i highly recommend giving it a watch. 9/10
