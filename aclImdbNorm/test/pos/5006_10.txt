i am appalled and dismayed that the network has canceled talk show with spike feresten !!<br /><br />what is wrong with the fox television network, canceling talk show with spike feresten and replacing it with wanda sikes? for those at the network with a short attention span, wanda at large was canceled because the audience grew tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience cringe, and wanda sykes spewing out her very own brand of vindictive mud slinging jokes is not humor, it is nasty and repulsive.<br /><br />apparently the fox television network has rewarded wanda sikes because she has garnered a self important appearance front of president barak obama. there is no doubt that wanda's recent ill tempered in front of the president of the united states are not funny and the audience laughter was only to patronize and please barak obama.<br /><br />talk show with spike feresten has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively insulted any guest or performer. spike's well rounded personality always gleefully, poked fun of life and himself.and his filed pieces during the first two seasons with aftra actress mary mae atwill, as the mae west of the 21st century were absolutely hysterical with spike feresten's skits:judge joe brown, trading spouses and last season's james kyson lee episode where spike chats with erica via the internet on the show. <br /><br />despite the network's budget constraints for elaborate field pieces and the second season's wga strike, spike feresten did not waiver his sense of humor or show integrity. talk show with spike feresten always had up in coming new talent and his comedy for stoners spoofs of nanny 911 and idiot paparazzi were considered cutting edge and had excellent production value. <br /><br />on a professional level, spike feresten, was the best executive producers, and set producer, brett webster along with his fabulous production crew were one of the best production teams that i have worked for in my aftra career .it would really be very foolish and sad shame to cancel talk show with spike feresten. <br /><br />unfortunately, its success could conceivably be taken to comedy central or another network and financially speaking, that would become a valuable revenue loss for fox television..<br /><br />on behalf of the late night saturday fox television audience, supporters of talk show with spike feresten, including all cast and crew, we beseech the network to retain the talk show with spike feresten franchise and give the crew a second opportunity to become a successful fox show.
