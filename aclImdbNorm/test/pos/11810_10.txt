for all the viewers who have seen 'the cure' would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming. joseph mazzello and brad renfro prove their star quality in this movie, along with dexter's (mazzello) mother annabella sciorra.<br /><br />when i first watched the cure on tv, i didn't know what to expect, but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about. dexter an 11 year old boy who is plagued with aids, sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour eric, which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys, but they soon became good friends.<br /><br />during the film, i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys, as they kept me wondering. i wondered how the heck they would get to new orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it. there were other great scenes throughout the movie.<br /><br />but the part that reached out to me was the part when dexter's health started to deteriorate. you just couldn't help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out. i thought at the first prank they played, that dexter was really dead he obviously wasn't, silly me. but when they play the third, something is very wrong. dexter doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter. at that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor dexter had died. at that part i lost it. i balled my eyes out, and from that scene onwards i was crying. you just have to. as the end nears you start to understand eric's loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the river.<br /><br />overall this movie was excellent. it has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness etc. when you put that in a blender you get an excellent, must watch film. peter horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best. but for now, i will try to search for this movie on dvd, if it exists that is. once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional rollercaoster.
