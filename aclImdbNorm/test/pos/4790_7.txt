nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist bunuel is ovbviously an attack on the catholic church and its loss of values. it is not a visual film and i think it would have played better on the stage. bunuel takes us through this man, the nazarene that lives like christ lived; a true follower i.e. in poverty, and without a care for property and what the next day bringeth. some might call it a parallel to christ's story but any follower and practitioner of the word, life should be like christ in a way. but in essence bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all. it is a bold statement to make that may enliven, or recite to memory the movie for some. truth, be told the nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it. his selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin;with the same face on each side. lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie, all with both faces the same. but the movie isn't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the movie's own doctrine. not top-notch bunuel but a "surreal" dream sequence that bunuel stages whithin where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the capability of the director, bunuel.
