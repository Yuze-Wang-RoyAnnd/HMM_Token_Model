the next karate kid, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. i thought that eric (chris conrad) and julie (hilary swank) looked good in their prom attire. to me, ned (michael cavalieri) was a real bully. this was because he got julie in trouble with principal wilkes (eugene boles). if you ask me, colonel dugan (michael ironside) was a pure a******! this was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. my favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between julie and the alpha elite. in conclusion, i highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial-arts flicks or are fans of hilary swank.
