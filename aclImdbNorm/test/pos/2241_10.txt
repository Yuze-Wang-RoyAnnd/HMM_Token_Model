this is one of the best episodes of doctor who ever. we have the cybermen, the cyber conversion units (may scare young children) and of coarse the doctor doing one of his best acts. bravo david tennant. good scenes as if it was a movie, with thrilling scenes in some streets, an invasion on the cyberman's base, and leaving the world different to ours, basically a 45 minute movie.<br /><br />being part 2 of rise of the cybermen, this would never disappoint. with it having a great build up to the final.<br /><br />the doctor plus an evil enemy (daleks, cybermen, master, sontarans, davros, autons, or even macra) is a battle to the death, just be careful with young children watching this.
