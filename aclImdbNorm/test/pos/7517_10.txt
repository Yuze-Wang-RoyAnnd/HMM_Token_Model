absolutely corrosive! director arthur hiller and writer paddy chayefsky dismantle the american hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit. the hospital depicted here is fraught with problems...from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose. george c. scott is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited diana rigg and her wacky father barnard hughes. alternately depressing and uproarious, the hospital features some of the most acid-tinged dialog imaginable (note how scott describes his love making session with rigg). it also has a lot of great vignettes: scott berating head nurse nancy marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor; daffy administrator frances sternhagen trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people; scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home-life. all of the acting is first-rate. scott and rigg are dynamite and hughes is a real surprise. the movie is a masterpiece with chayefsky's script earning a well-deserved oscar (over such stiff competition as klute & sunday, bloody sunday). the opening narration is priceless.
