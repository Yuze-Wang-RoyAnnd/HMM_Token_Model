remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the weirdest movie possible? this is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance.<br /><br />i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about. it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the "black forest." he goes there to help, but ends up being caught between two young women, both of whom he seems to have a thing for. but that's just scratching the surface. this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen...and not nice thing. people are constantly being whipped and stabbed. there's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining. tom savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore. he's got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus suffering.<br /><br />on some level, this is a movie about sex. it's one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but there's no mistaking the intent. on another whole level, it's a stoner's paradise. unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected. by the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn, you'll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flick.<br /><br />on the down side, the film is pretty wordy. some of the points are hammered home over and over. if you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends, this might prove an asset.
