a good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. lead by mario van peebles, who does ok, the gang of misfits on the run from billy zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. there're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even stephen baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.
