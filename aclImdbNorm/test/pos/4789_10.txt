every time this movie used to re-air on late night tv in the late 70s and early 80s i would always make time to sit in front of the tv and watch it. to see the lovely kate jackson, handsome richard long, the "great" polly bergen whom i've never seen anywhere else except for this tv movie, the endearing tom bosley, and another "great" whom i've never seen outside this movie, celeste holme. this is truly the love boat on a cruise to murder and mayhem and boy was it ever good!! and every time i would watch it i would always forget who the real murderer was.<br /><br />as expected, someone here is already criticizing the movie as if that really is a big help to anyone. this is a great tv movie and worth watching each and every time. i can't say that about half the movies i've seen this month.<br /><br />if you ever get a chance to watch it on tv someday, which isn't likely, watch it. in light of "the girl most likely to" finally coming out this year on dvd, maybe there's hope for a dvd release of "death cruise."
