after reading previews for this movie i thought it would be a let down, however after i got my region 1 dvd ( the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas) i was pleasantly surprised, strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie. the fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get bogged down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater. i recommend this movie to one and all<br /><br />
