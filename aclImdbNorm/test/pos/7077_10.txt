i saw this movie in september with my mother. i was expecting a good movie, and i saw an excellent one. this is now my most treasured movie. it did not leave me after i left the theater. the situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. meryl streep and renee zellweger were equally incredible. this movie has made me realize how important family relationships are. rent it. i can't recommend it enough.
