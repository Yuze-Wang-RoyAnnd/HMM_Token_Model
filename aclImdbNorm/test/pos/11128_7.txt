in new york, a group of freshmen join the high school for the performing arts after being well succeeded in their audition. for four years, their dreams, deceptions, success, love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure doris finsecker (maureen teefy), the homosexual montgomery (payl mccrane), the aggressive leroy (gene anthony ray), the hopeful coco (irene cara), the ambitious ralph garci (barry miller) and their friends until their graduation day.<br /><br />twenty-eight years ago, "fame" was a great success, with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business, and i loved this movie and the soundtrack on cd. i have just watched "fame" on dvd, and presently i would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only, but with too many flawed subplots. the story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer. i do not know whether alan parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie, but what happened, for example, with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion? what happened with leroy and his teacher, did he fail due to his grammar problem? what happened with coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook? the musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot. anyway, "fame" is still a delightful entertainment and a cult-movie for me. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "fama" ("fame")
