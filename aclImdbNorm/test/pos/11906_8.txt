the movie was better than what i expected. i was working on the movie set for a short period of time when damien was making this film.the gun fire, stunt and acting came out pretty good on the editing tip.all thou the the music wasn't all that great. better music would have top this film.some of the music sound like the hippie days. damien remember you have gang violence gangster's some oldies or hip hop would have did it. it was more realistic than blood in blood out.the casting was picked real well.suspectentertaint did a good job in this film.the movie brought back a fill of a life style i use to live. but than at the end you do not always win. and in my history thats how it was.i adapted to the movie the first time i watched it.damien congratulatoins on this film.
