`manna from heaven' is a delightfully compelling film.<br /><br />within the shifting paradox of values in middle-class americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of `damon runyonesque' characters.<br /><br />their struggles with moral dilemmas, dotting on `what might have been,' hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams, romantic yearnings, and `hit it big' combine to make a most entertaining film. rather than relying upon `in-your- face' sexual explicitness, the burgeoning relationship between inez and mac/bake is classically subtle but clear. his untying the knot in her shoelace at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstanding<br /><br />the script's crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast. one of the few films i have ever fone to see twice in its opening run, `manna from heaven' definitely warrants national distribution.<br /><br />conrad f. toepfer
