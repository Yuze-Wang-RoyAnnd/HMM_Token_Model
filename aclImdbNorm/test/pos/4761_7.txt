****spoilers**** buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker vito lucia, tony lo bianco, came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals moon & bo, richard lynch & bill hickman. <br /><br />vito getting close with his boyhood friend buddy manucci, roy scheider, as a mob informer to win over buddy's trust and have him tell vito what's coming down on the streets of new york in regard to mob activities. buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the nypd, the seven ups, that does things "their way" to clean up the streets of new york of criminals. <br /><br />vito gets information from buddy and makes it look to buddy that he's really giving him tips about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his hoodlum associates, moon & bo, to rip the mobsters off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and hold them for ransom.<br /><br />everything is going well for vito & co. until the mob decides to retaliate and mistakenly grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the seven ups ansel, ken kercheval,who was working undercover thinking he was one of the hoods who was kidnapping and ripping them off. later ansel was accidentally killed by moon when he blasted out the trunk of the car that ansel was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash, ransom, in it.<br /><br />fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and grimy photography of new york city that was so effective in the movie "the french connection" which also stars both roy scheider & tony lo bianco who are in this movie too. incredible car chase that started in downtown brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of new jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with buddy almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts. <br /><br />roy scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor i can think off like clint eastwood would have been in the same movie. scheider reminds me a lot of, he even looks a bit like him, former welterweight and middleweight champion gene fullmer who beat the great sugar ray robinson for the middleweight championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie : tough durable and destructive. <br /><br />tony lo bianco is very good as vito the undertaker the lowlife heel who plays off buddy and the mob to the point that leads to buddy's partner ansel getting killed. even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for vito since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offed mobsters to pay his sick wife's rose's hospital and medical bills. even the fact that ansel was killed due to his actions vito never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned. in the end vito have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring mobsters. <br /><br />the movie "the seven ups" has the late bill hickman doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film. hickman was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and highways of new york city and san francisco "the french connection" and "bullitt".
