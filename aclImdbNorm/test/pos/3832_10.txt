this is one of the best of the early "star trek" episodes, with kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded romulans are racial offshoots of the vulcans! young mr. stiles, well-played by paul comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the "star trek" universe. his barely disguised hatred of mr. spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many americans have of people of arab or middle eastern origin. the atmosphere of war-time paranoia is all too real. then there's the romulans: they're the ultimate federation nemesis. the klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. the romulans, however, mean business: they're the ancient romans reborn in the space age; in spite of their vulcanoid features they're clearly meant to remind us of imperial rome, with names like decius and titles like "centurion" and "praetor." the chain-mail armor is really cool. familiar guest star mark lenard, who went on to play spock's dad sorek as well as the klingon commander in "star trek: the motion picture" is an appropriately grizzled, war-weary commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to laurence olivier's crassus in "spartacus." also, his questioning of the empire's unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings marcus aurelius (richard harris) expressed at the beginning of "gladiator." a must both for trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.
