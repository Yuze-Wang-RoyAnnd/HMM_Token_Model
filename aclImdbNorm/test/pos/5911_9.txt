stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie, although he was portraying a much younger person. i still recall my fascination with lindbergh's story and while i was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made, i had to see it.<br /><br />not only does this boast a great performance by stewart,it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data,making it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself. and the look of the plane itself was great.<br /><br />i quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and reawakens the childhood love i had for airplanes and for the idea of air travel.
