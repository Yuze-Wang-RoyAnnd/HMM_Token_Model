first off let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underrated movies since this came out in 72. i absolutely loved this movie, it's very urban, gritty, no real hollywood glam added to it.. you can actually feel for all of the characters in here, i love the blood just splattering abound in here. joe pesci was pretty good in here, but to me it seems like he was definitely outdone by the lead character joe cortese, now i don't know anything about him , but boy can he really act.. i believe this movie is probably true, because living in new jersey,, living close to philly, you here this kinda thing all the time. i think that if the movie had a bigger budget , and say robert deniro as jerry's boss you would have a perfect movie, but hey who am i to argue, i was so engrossed by this film, that it is already up there in my mind, with mean streets. i wish hollywood would go back to this urbanized, gritty display of movie making: it would serve them very well to do so. this movie is a great drama with great actors in it. and i highly recommend it to anyone.
