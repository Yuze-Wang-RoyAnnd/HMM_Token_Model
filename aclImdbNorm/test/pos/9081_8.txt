i just watch this move recently on encore channel. what a great film, a great cast as well. flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable. the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement. therefore nelson played by kiefer sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life. then it's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life. then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for randy steckle played by olliver platt. then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of god. david labraccio played by kevin bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about god. it's amazing to watch julia roberts along with kevin bacon, oliver platt, william baldwin and kiefer sutherland at such a prime time of their careers. one can ask how come we don't have such great movie produced anymore. this is one of the best productions from joel schumacher. i really enjoy this movie.
