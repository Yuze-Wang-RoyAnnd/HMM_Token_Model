viewed this the other night on cable on-demand and thought, "this is the type of movie that might have starred alec guiness and glynis johns if it had been made in the late 50's". a farce in the english tradition. alfred molina and brenda blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portrayals. naomi watts simply sizzles in a ditzy jayne mansfield-ish (if she could have acted) way. rest of the cast have some great turns and bits. the welsh landscape is delightful. an absurd premise, indeed and not at all believable, but that doesn't get in the way of enjoyment. not a great movie, mind you, but a truly fun watch. and walken is at his wacky best. a joy to behold!
