i found this film to be one of those great heart-warming gems. the story line is tightly woven and the character development throughout fantastic! i am a big fan of non-us films anyway and this is right up there with: "happenstance," "the closet" even "king of hearts." vlastimil brodsky as fanda, is fantastic. it is a love story in the true sense of loving life and the twists and turns it takes to get the viewer to understand/enjoy fanda's view of life (which nearly costs him<br /><br />more than he is prepared to give) are wonderful. his co-star stelle zazvorkova is unforgettable as his fed-up wife. i highly recommend this movie for the whole family--my children loved it.
