lt. claude (claudio cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by edmond rackham (richard johnson). following a few random prisoner deaths, rackham takes in claude and his two remaining prisoners. luckily for everyone, barbara bach just happens to be on the island too! unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.<br /><br />this italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of creature from the black lagoon mixed with dr. moreau with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff. despite some wonky looking fishmen costumes, the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through. all of the actors are good and joseph cotton even pops up as a old biologist. director sergio martino handles himself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so. that can't be said for his belated follow-up the fishmen and their queen (1995), easily one of the wackiest and most off-base sequels since highlander ii.
