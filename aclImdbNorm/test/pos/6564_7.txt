as is frequently the case when manga is translated into live action, there is quite a bit lost in the translation. however, this remains a highly entertaining film. the premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet, understated style so prevalent in japanese films (ha!). the special effects are a little 70s camp but, it adds to the comic book feel of the film. i wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but, if you are familiar with (and enjoyed) other japanese horror films like "evil dead's trap", this film will appeal to you.
