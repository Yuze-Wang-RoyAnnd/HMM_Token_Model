i've seen this movie a few times and with each viewing i still feel the excitement of embarking on a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that impede the path. it's more than a mere desire of finding home; it's about the very basic human spirit of finding one's way in the world, of overcoming despair, of facing the character foibles that deter our goals. underlying these human endeavors is the challenge to reconsider the origin of life. while this film is imbued with serious ideas, it has just enough comedic lines to leave the viewers hopeful. it is surprisingly funny. the execution of the story line is excellent! this is all packaged with visually engaging animation. a must see.<br /><br />
