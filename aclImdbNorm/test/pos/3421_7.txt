possible spoilers<br /><br />no one is likely to pick up a dvd of red dust without knowing that it is about south africa's truth and reconciliation commission. hilary swank stars as a south african exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing alex mpondo (chiwetel ejiofer), a member of the south african parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, pete muller (ian roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the truth and reconciliation commission. they could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a south african accent; ms. swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably american accent. nevertheless she is the only well-known actor in the movie, and it would probably not have been made without her or someone equally well known. she does a passable job. however, ejiofer and muller (pronounced in the german way with an umlat over the "u") are outstanding as is jamie barlett as the chief of police, responsible for murdering mpondo's comrade and fellow prisoner. the torture scenes are shown in brief flashes but they are vivid and believable. what is not believable is the truth and reconciliation process -- except that it actually happened. "red dust" should be seen for that reason alone because it was and is unbelievable that the anc prisoners could actually forgive the torturers, and this is as close as we are likely to get to seeing the process in action.
