once in a while one come across a movie that forces one to rethink about society's reaction to people who differ from its definition of normal.<br /><br />mitthi having suffered at the hands of unsocial elements,left all alone to cope with her tragedy, retreats into her idyllic world....one which according to her is the real world.....<br /><br />surreal(mitthi's world) superimposes itself on the real(her family).<br /><br />mitthi, suffering from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities about trying to rehabilitate 'patients' like them. are we right to drag them back to our reality when all we have to offer them in ours is pain and suffering? what right have we to deprive them of their source of happiness? what right do we have to take away their joy when we are unable to help them in their sorrow? 15 park avenue is one of the best movies on social issues...showing us the need that any patient needs empathy and not plain sympathy.
