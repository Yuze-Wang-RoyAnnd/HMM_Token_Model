it is hard to know what category to put this film in, most films set in this time period of us history are westerns but here instead of the wide open plains of the west the action is almost entirely confined to a claustrophobic girls boarding school in louisiana.<br /><br />the film opens with amy, a young girl, walking though the woods picking mushrooms, as she does so she stumbles upon corporal john 'mcbee' mcburney, a wounded union soldier, who she takes back to the school. we know that he isn't a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from alerting a passing confederate patrol even though she told him she was twelve.<br /><br />once back at the school opinions are divided about what should be done with their new guest, some think they should look after him till his wounds are healed while others believe that it is treason not to hand him over to confederate forces at the first opportunity. the former group prevail and he gradually recovers. as he does so his presence has an effect on all of the girls who haven't had a man on site for a long time, including a young teacher and the head mistress who's previous relationship appears to have been with her own brother. mcbee sets about seducing them, emotionally if not physically, this leads to considerable jealousy amongst the girls.<br /><br />while this film is rated fifteen it is definitely not for younger viewers both for the sexual content, of which little is actually shown but much is implied, and for a very gruelling scene which had me squirming more than any other scene in any film i've seen for quite some time. it is interesting to see clint eastwood play against type, instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and for most of the time at the mercy of the women around him. the acting is solid throughout, not just from eastwood but also from all the actresses, including the young pamelyn ferdin who played amy.
