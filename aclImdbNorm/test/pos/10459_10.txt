simply one of the greatest films ever made. worthy of sitting alongside such european masterworks as the rules of the game, grand illusion, nostalghia, andrei roublev, 8 1/2, wings of desire, viridiana, the night of the shooting stars, la strada, ordet,the passion of joan of arc, the four hundred blows and madame de... both a blessing...and an almost perfect work of art.
