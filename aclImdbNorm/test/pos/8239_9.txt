the beautiful, charming, supremely versatile and talented irene dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of american cinema. in over 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural, yet glamorous presence. she is simultaneously authentic and human, and a charismatic, inspirational model. this role is quintessential irene dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief. i love all of her films, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when tcm aired it last night. i hope they don't wait years to air it again.<br /><br />likewise, charles coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of american filmdom. true, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but i never tire of watching his soft-hearted curmudgeons. here his character is the perfect foil for irene dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by coburn. their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic. they never miss a beat. in addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of irene dunne's husband, portrayed by alexander knox.<br /><br />i am not as familiar with knox's work. he was recognizable, but that was about all. however, cast with dunne and coburn, he holds his own. he delivers a fine, nuanced performance. his character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by knox's performance and never held over us like some holy grail. he is noble, but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete ocs. his interaction with dunne, is always convincing, too. dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in kind. their scenes are very well done.<br /><br />the film, itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a milieu not portrayed in other movies. i don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays america still fighting wwii, but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post-war world. not the usual wwii movie! that in itself is interesting; it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message. in contrast to other commentators, i thought that the climactic speech was okay, but not great. it was delivered very well by knox, but it was not as "tightly" written as the build-up led me to expect. i have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes. it served its purpose.<br /><br />for me, the greater value of the movie, was the depiction of the life of dunne and knox, as it reflected the typical ocs experience. the sense of community among the wives living on palmetto terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as did palmetto terrace, itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set. the incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their ocs husbands. the rigors of the ocs candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn. the shabby "base housing" - obviously hastily constructed. the tired and worn furnishings. the constant and harrowingly short deadlines - for returning to base, for learning lessons, for catching trains to subsequent "posts." tenants constantly running into their predecessors and successors in the base housing, as they were moving in and out. yes, i suspect this was a glimpse of a real wwii experience - clothed in some comedy, but very real at its core. i loved it, and i recommend it highly.
