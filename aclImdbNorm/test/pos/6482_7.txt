the beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980's new york. this involves fighting with the other street gang that they directly share a high school class with, trying to stay in school, as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like the dead kennedy's and have the name skulls for their band name. rex (played by david jacobson) plays an autistic kid who starts to get a long with all of these kinds, and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful, and if applied to what these kids do in life can really make things work out for the better! billy kane (played by william mcnamara) and kate kane (played by kara glover) are brother and sister. although they roll with this crowd of thugs, these kids are not the same type of people as this group. they care for rex and they care for others, and really show an enlightened side of themselves. while his sister sleeps with the head of the gang, she is also falling in love with rex, trying to show him that she is not a slut. but in the end, the teachers at the school finally get to him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally feels it is time to end his life, while animals of sound played without him. but they like to think that he is not dead, he is just living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean. this movie, was one of those movies where i was glad that i watched it. while it was extremely entertaining, it also had a big message to it. something a long the lines that these kids had no direction, no future, no figure heads to look up to, but because a troubled kid came along they all realized that there was way more important things to life then fighting the local black kids, or being destructive to everything. rex showed them the beauty in angry music. rex showed them the beauty in rats, disease and murder. rex showed they the beauty in almost everything, while some of those things have no beauty involved, they still were able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. rex played an important part in this move, who changed everyones heart from depression, to see that there is hope for them, and thats why he started to show them; the beat.
