this is without a doubt one of neil simon's best plays turned movies. it's full of great characters, and memorable dialog. johnathan silverman makes a great screen version of young eugene(he was played by matthew broderick on stage).this is the first of simon's autobiographical trilogy, its followed by the wonderful "biloxi blues", and closes with the tv movie "broadway bound". if i had to say the movie has any flaws it would maybe be that characters sometimes usually speak in obvious dialog, but that's alright because it's great dialog. rent this little gem, you won't be sorry!
