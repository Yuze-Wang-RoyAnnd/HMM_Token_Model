it's pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone. if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made. too bad you would have been watching it alone. probably the reason you hate it... no game. keys to the vip is hilarious, light and funny. guys are going to eat this show up. my game is tight and i can hardly wait to get on this show. the chicks were hooooot and the clubs kicked ass. i'll be watching every week. it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren't being made. now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television.
