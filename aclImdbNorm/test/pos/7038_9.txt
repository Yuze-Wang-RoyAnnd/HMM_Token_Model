ahhhh, 1984.... i was young and stupid, and just developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes, whilst living in a squat in manchester's moss side, with the most unbelievable case of cockroach infestation.<br /><br />after a few of those doobies, this show was rotflmao material - i was an avid fan. then i'd look down at the floor (or up at the walls, or just about anywhere) and see my very own collection of "little armadillos" scuttling about.<br /><br />not sure if it was the chemical enhancement, but i remember thinking at the time that the overt surrealism of the show was fantastic - it was my second favourite thing on tv at the time (#1 was the season of luis bunuel movies being shown by channel 4). radical art lives on! <br /><br />also you gotta that theme tune! ....i swear, i'll never drink no more....
