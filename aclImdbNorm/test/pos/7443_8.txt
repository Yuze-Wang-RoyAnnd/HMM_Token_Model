the movie is really cool, i thought. it sticks to the original game quite well, and some of the battle scenes are depicted in such high detail, it's incredible. i thought the movie could have been a little better if they'd give you a little more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what hooks on you this movie.<br /><br />the cg is beautiful, i don't think they could have done a better job graphics wise. every little detail, the way they move, the way their swords look, everything is perfect. the way they make the characters look is almost like they're real people.<br /><br />the music was great, and i found it entertaining to listen to just how much of it was remixed from the original game, with new instruments and effects.<br /><br />all and all, i'd recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys fast paced action and a good storyline. i would definitely play the game before i'd watch the movie though.
