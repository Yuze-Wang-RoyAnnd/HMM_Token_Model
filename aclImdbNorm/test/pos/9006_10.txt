forever strong is one of those sports movies you can actually watch. it reminded me a lot of remember the titans because it included comedy, sadness, and just awesomeness. i saw it at a pre-screening and all my friends liked it and easily put it in their top 2 sport movies. the acting is great in the movie. even though it is similar to remember the titans it there is something very unique about this movie. i feel this is definitely oscar worthy and will receive many awards. everybody should definitely go see this movie and it is worth your $10. i'm going to have to see it again when it comes out because it was that good. i cant say one bad thing about the movie.
