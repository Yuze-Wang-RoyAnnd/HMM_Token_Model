i saw the korean version of daisy first. it came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish. i saw it 3 times as i waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive.<br /><br />then i got the dc and watched it. wow! i think this is the first real director's cut i've ever seen. amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! the dc is laid out like a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. it moves at a slower pace than the korean version.the variations between both versions are so drastic, it seems like two totally different movies. i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again, toughing it out just to look for the added scenes. that wasn't the case. it really felt like i was watching a whole new movie.<br /><br />while the dc is 20 minutes longer than the korean version, you'll be hard-pressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed. 2 seconds chopped off here. a second added there. an entire scene added here. another erased there. in both versions, scenes have been added, omitted or chopped up and reordered. in some scenes, entire lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered - while the scene itself was untouched. even simple sound effects were added/omitted from each version - having a major impact on the mood of the film, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene. what comes across as a tender moment in the korean version is a sad, somber one in the dc. the endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. as far as i can tell, both versions end a lot different, and were intended that way.<br /><br />i'm assuming most people will be acquiring the director's cut of the film, and will find the movie pretty decent, but a little long and boring. if that's the case, look for the korean version. same movie, but different feel. i think there's a deluxe 3-dvd version that contains both cuts of the film - not sure.<br /><br />the versions compliment each other so well that as a pair, i'll watch daisy more often than i do any of my other favorite korean movies. alone, i'd say the korean version is a nice love story that i'd watch once in awhile. the director's cut, i'll watch maybe once or twice, then never again, as i find the pacing dull. but they just go so well together! for what i consider the best experience, i'd say watch the korean version first. then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about.<br /><br />the editing is the real star of the film.
