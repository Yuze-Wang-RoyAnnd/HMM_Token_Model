if u haven't seen vijay in "ghillli", "gilly" or "ghillie". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. there are tons of hot guys in this one, look out for someone who calls velu "maacha". the one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. his teeth are brilliant as well. vijay rocks. trisha cries every 5 seconds. it is very deep. watch it, you won't regret it. there are some great laughs in this one. if you don't speak tamil, learn it. then you will get all the inside jokes. it is one for the whole family, except maybe the violent bits should be skipped. i've seen this movie around eleven times .... and counting.<br /><br />wow!
