i saw this originally on channel 4 (uk) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. however i saw it on irish tv recently and there was an added narration by roy scheider ("we're going to need a bigger boat!"). this ruined the film for me. his droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes from the films brilliance. i wonder at the new dvd version that has no roy (due to legal reasons?) would stop people from buying it. well believe me, the film is much better for it!<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />damian
