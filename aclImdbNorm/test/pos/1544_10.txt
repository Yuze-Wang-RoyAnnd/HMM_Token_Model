this is one of those classic american made for tv movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon. although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery / horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. a big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round lake tommahawk i for one would not mind living there!<br /><br />all in all a great film to watch over and over again.
