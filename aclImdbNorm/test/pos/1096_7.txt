i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera. i think it's a little bit influenced by the brazilian movie "city of god", but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow (crime and art) in social neighborhood are a reality. <br /><br />i think the films made by madiba are really beautiful. i don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films, because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius. <br /><br />i enjoyed very much the soundtrack. it's adjusted to the pictures.<br /><br />see the movie...it's good to show how can be a life in a social neighborhood.
