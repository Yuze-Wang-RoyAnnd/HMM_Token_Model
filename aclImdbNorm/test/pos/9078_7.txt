hollywood is one of the best and the beautiful things that had occurred in my life. i admire and am very much fascinated by the way hollywood generates ideas and implement them. it makes me wonder about the scope of human brain. i saw flatliners a long time back but the story, direction, cast and of all acting is still fresh in my mind. the story begins with our lead actor sutherland saying during sunrise "what a beautiful day to die." for all of us, it's a story which shows emotions that are sometimes withheld in our mind during our entire life. never able to understand few things in life. it shows us to get motivated and to improve our quality of life. anyway i suggest it to all that watch it once.
