this is apparently the first film featuring gloria swanson--the film that made her a breakout star. while she was good in the film, i can't see how this performance in particular was so noteworthy at the time--but, still it was a very good film.<br /><br />gloria plays the wife of a rich slob that continually takes her for granted. he cares little for his grooming, eats onions and forgets their anniversary! and, at the same time, a lothario comes into their lives and begins paying a lot of attention to gloria and her dippy husband doesn't even notice or give her any reason not to cheat on him. ultimately, she divorces her hubby and marries the smooth-talking romeo. however, while the movie could have just been an overdone melodrama (they were pretty common at the time), it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and fun film. while not the greatest silent film i have seen, it is a standout and deserves to be remembered.<br /><br />by the way, the dvd release from image entertainment is surprisingly good--with a decent print and music. this hasn't always been true of other image releases (particularly how sloppily they handled the chaplin releases).
