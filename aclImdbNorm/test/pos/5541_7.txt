i'm not a fan of this brand of comedy - stereotyped characters over-acting their way through a cops and robbers farce. but there are enough likable characters to sustain interest. michelle pfeiffer is adorable, but the person really carrying the film is dean stockwell, who steals every scene as the head mobster (named tony, no less). <br /><br />stockwell's performance is the reason i'm writing this review (and the only reason i'd recommend it), in fact. you'll be tickled by his screen time. he's plays the mob boss perfectly, with comedic touches in the right places, managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche. in fact, stockwell's a complete delight to watch - a master of the 'double take,' and a real 'looker' in those classy suits and fedoras. <br /><br />meesa says: a good film to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers.
