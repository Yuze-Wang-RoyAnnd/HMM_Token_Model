this show is verging on brilliant. it's a modern day married...with children. the scripts are witty, as they are sprinkled with clever sarcasm. they are also realistic, dealing with issues that face many parents of teenagers today. as well as the on going burden that you might not be the worlds greatest parent, and how is the best way to deal with this? however, at the same time, it manages to remain light hearted and fun. which, with all the drama and action on television these days, is a very pleasant and welcome change. it is something you can sit down in front of for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and relate to. it isn't the world's most hilarious comedy. yet will make you laugh at least a handful of times an episode. michael rapaport is brilliant in the lead as dave. he fills the big shoes that the heavily sarcastic script requires and then some. he and anita barone (vikki) have fantastic chemistry and bounce off one another very well. this show has a strong future if it is marketed at the correct target audience, and put in the right time slot. also, if fox release it on dvd, the following will be stronger and larger. (as is a classic example with scrubs.)
