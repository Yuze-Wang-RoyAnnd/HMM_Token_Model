first, let's call this movie what it is:<br /><br />1. it's a feel-good movie with a message.<br /><br />2. the acting is just okay, dialog slightly better, production value pretty good.<br /><br />3. rugby scenes...just barely passable.<br /><br />but here's the trick: this isn't something hollywood contrived, and it isn't trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport. it is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people, in real circumstances, and a real storyline. sure, they could have done a better job actually rep'ing the sport, but my vote: it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do.<br /><br />(and fwiw, i can't think of many football, baseball, hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either. c'mon...bull durham?)<br /><br />i'm not a rugby player (i was a wrestler) but i graduated from highland, attended '86-'90, and occasionally trained with the rugby guys. my brother-in-law david, however, was one of the original founding members of the highland rugby club in 1976. (his younger brother, billy, played the next year, as i recall. if you're interested, there's a highland rugby site at highlandrugby.net that addresses the history of the team.) <br /><br />by the time i was there the club had been in existence for about a decade, and had long since built a reputation for excellence. it's a fact that they focused on "broad" training topics: devotion, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. i thought the rugby guys i knew were a little 'off' in the head, but i think i might have just been a little jealous. they were hard-core dedicated to the belief system that gelwix promoted.<br /><br />with regard to the "cultural mixing" issues that have been brought up, it might be interesting to note that while i was there in the 80's, one of the larger schools in the city was shut down - south high school - and its students distributed among the other 3 primary slc schools. to be honest, highland pre-80's was pretty whitebread...i've got a picture of the team from (i think) 1977 that shows an *all* white club. south high, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: i had a pair of friends from south who joined the team, one tongan, one samoan, and as i recall there were a bunch of island-nation players that joined up '88-'90. i don't think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys, it's that they walked the walk. <br /><br />and as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschool-age teams in the world: yeah, it's true that us-rugby, on average when taken as a whole, does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere. there are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that rugby doesn't have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the us that arise in other countries.<br /><br />with that said, judge highland on its merits: <br /><br />- the *only* team to qualify for the usa rugby national championships every year of that organizations' 25-yr history.<br /><br />- a win record of 392 wins, 9 losses. read that again...winningest coach in any us sport in history.<br /><br />- regular international tours. <br /><br />- some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams.<br /><br />are they the world best? maybe some years, probably not most...but they're pretty good on a consistent basis. and it's disrespectful to the game to blow them off, when highland rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the us.
