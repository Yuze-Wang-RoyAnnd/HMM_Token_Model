classe tous risques (the big risk) is repeatedly recommended every time i look up a jean-pierre melville film that i had to give it a watch as soon as possible. since i've been discovering melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by claude sautet, before melville would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir.<br /><br />classe tous risques has two of the best lead men of the time, lino ventura and jean-paul belmondo. ventura plays abel, a gangster exiled in italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to paris because the police are closing in on him. after a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, abel eventually gets hooked up with eric stark (belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. stark becomes abel's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on abel after everything he's done and been through. the film shows the the duality of the two men, the older abel at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger eric starting off the same way abel did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. it never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him.<br /><br />much like melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. as usual, as what i feel with melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what i missed the first time. classe tous risques is a definite keeper.
