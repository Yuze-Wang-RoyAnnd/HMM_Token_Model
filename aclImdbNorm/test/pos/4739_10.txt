if you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and unchecked government can do to "un-popular" people, this movie provides it. read what some people are saying about the "patriot act" passed after 9/11 and then watch this movie. is it worth it? do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people? regardless of what you saw on tv, you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. i apologize for quoting another reviewer, but it needs repeating: roger ebert of siskel & ebert said, "what's interesting is if you're looking for people who are unbalanced zealots... you don't find them among the branch davidians, you find them among the fbi and the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms; those are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared, i think." i think every person responsible for 9/11 needs to be brought to justice, but i think the government has not shown a history of honoring it's duty to protect people's rights, and this movie proves it in dramatic fashion.
