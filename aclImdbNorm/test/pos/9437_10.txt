do you like explosions? how about fighting? well, this movie has both of those. you know the other thing you can't have a movie without: a kick ass motorcycle, the type that bounces off someone's head and knocks them out at the same time. you bet the stabilizer has one. there's even a classic cliff scene.<br /><br />all in all, i'm quite proud that i have even seen this movie...and even prouder to have my review be the first one...yes!
