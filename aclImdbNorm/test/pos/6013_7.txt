*the whereabouts of al capone<br /><br />*who shot jfk?<br /><br />*cynthia gibb lands the part of "gypsy" in the tv remake<br /><br />these are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. how else can i say it, except, i thought she was unredeemingly awful. mannequin mannerisms, poor reactionary acting (ie: that blank, stoic stare while he co-star in the scene speaks)and a singing voice that most voice coaches would rate "mediocre". but she is stunningly gorgeous and after all, wasn't that what the gypsy character is all about? cashing in on her looks cuz' she didn't cut the mustard in the talent department?<br /><br />as for the rest... bette is fantastic. whether or not she's playing herself or playing mama rose, it works either way, and i for one thought rosalind russell was as exciting as drywall in the original. peter riegart as "herbie" is the perfect understated foil to bette's over-the-top mama, and he's the medium-temperature porridge between midler's hot dish and gibb's stone cold mush. riegart is juuuust right.<br /><br />one final holler to the man responsible for decades to come of cher jokes: bob mackie. drag queens would kill for the glitz and glamour on display here. everything's coming up sequins and bugle beads!<br /><br />
