ahhh...the '80's. 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in america. fresh off the "do what feels good" '70's, "the last american virgin" comes as a wolf in sheep's clothing as yet another 'teenage sex comedy' from the glory days. oh sure, there's sex, but, i can't think of another movie--ok, this and "fast times at ridgemont high"--that really wasn't killing time between topless teenage scenes--there was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavage.<br /><br />the movie follows three hormonal friends. gary (wanting to lose his virginity), rick (stud incarnate), and david (overweight, but, not inexperienced) as they try desperately hard to make sure gary joins the world of manhood. but, a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger--gary falls for karen (pretty brunette who loves the bad boys), and can't seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that david and rick can facilitate. only trouble is, rick and karen get hot and heavy and karen skips a period. it's gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion, and it's gary who truly cares. but, who is karen dancing with by film end...rick. subtract the "r" and add a "d" where necessary.<br /><br />what separates this film from others from the '80's we think about is that, by god, they attempt some real drama here, and not of the "my parents just pulled in the driveway variety." and, you know what? i bought it.<br /><br />it wasn't sloppy. it wasn't far-fetched. and, when gary sees rick dancing with karen at the house party at the end of the film, i actually felt sorry for the guy. our teenage romeo actually believed in unrequited love--and when his heart was broken at the end, it all sort of touched me.<br /><br />so, all the t&a aside, there's an actually pretty believable and engaging story here. oscar worthy? not by a mile, but, i don't know that i'd lump it into the "let's get laid" category, either. like "fast times at ridgemont high," they actually were trying to do a true film here, letting the hi-jinx in between fall where it may.
