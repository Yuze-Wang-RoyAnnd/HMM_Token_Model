a wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups. yes, they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the hollywood fluff. this all under the masterful direction of antonioni and wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them dwarfed by the surroundings with long wide shots. it is great to see that there is lust in the mid-life crises sector.
