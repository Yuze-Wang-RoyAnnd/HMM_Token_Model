this trash version of `romeo and juliet' passes in manhattan in the present days. romeo (will keenan) is an a**hole and violent member of family que, and juliet (jane jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual girl of capulet family. the scatological situations this romantic pair will face are very funny. although being a cult movie (inclusive exhibited in rio de janeiro festival), it is not recommended for all the audiences. if the viewer is fan of peter jackson's former movies (`braindead', `bad taste'), `toxic avenger', `body melt' and other trash movie, he will certainly love this flick. otherwise, he will hate it. since i belong to the first group, my vote is eight.<br /><br />
