haggard: the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn, and his girlfriend who cheated on him, also with the help from his two friend, 1. a skate boarder who lives for nothing, and, 2. a trying-to-be funny scientist (which doesn't really work) played by bam margera and brandom dicamillo.<br /><br />the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass, etc, but to say it was written by bam margera and co. this is a very weak attempt, seems to me like it was written when he was bored, or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to.<br /><br />the films also stars bam's girlfriend jennifer rivell, who plays glauren, ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him, again very bad acting by jennifer, another actor that some people may be interested in is steve a.k.a hellboy, played by rakeyohn, which his character does not seem to be with the story, again bad acting, also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring. but worst of all, is raab's character, the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer, also i think he could have been improved! overall i think the characters in this film aren't with the story, like in one scene, it would be on one certain character, a minute later, a different scene, different character.<br /><br />to say that this is supposed to be a film, sort of a documentary, its not played by the characters as a documentary, the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time.<br /><br />towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn, although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon.<br /><br />in conclusion this film is ok, if you laugh at things that aren't very funny, stupid stunts, terrible acting and the occasional nude scene!, also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music! 7/10
