i found the film quite good for what i was expecting. although i weary, because i have a fear of injection needles, i sort of came to expect when they were coming. so if you're not into needles, blood, the human body, and some good medical fun, put this movie back and rent another. as the other user commented, i was also please at the german attempt at a slasher film. i'm an american who just moved to germany to stay with a family and saw this lying on the shelf. i love psychological thrillers, and i'd say this is somewhere along those lines. a character falls into places and feels misconstrued. while trying to dig her way out and find some truth to a situation, things get a little sticky and other aren't so sure she's on the right track. so throughout the film you're kept on edge about who's anatomy you might catch a glimpse of and who's rounding the next corner.
