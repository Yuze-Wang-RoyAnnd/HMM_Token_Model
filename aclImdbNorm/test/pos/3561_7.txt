a train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit monetero. however bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. the only clue is that of a medallion, but monetero is captured and soon would be executed. a stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold. in exchange monetero gives him half of the medallion, but clayton notices it and discovers something is up. soon all three are crossing each other for the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and monetero's gang are watching on, waiting for their chance to pounce.<br /><br />just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a tongue-in-cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references (some nicely realised) from other films (largely the dollar trilogy) of its sub-genre. director enzo castellari's sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight, but there's potential in many of his grand, showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace. largely there's a lot of tussles, fist-fights (and plenty of acrobatic stunts) taking place, compared with all-out vicious shootouts. however most of these stunts are very well done, and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn. the traditional story sticks close to conventional details, but since there's a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on, the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three. this leads up to many effective suspenseful moments, clever twists, and plenty of wink, wink. the humour within the starch script is pretty sly. worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style, is giovanni bergamini's dynamically taut framing and francesco de masi's impulsively rousing music score. the performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport. george hilton's wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger. gilbert roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable mexican bandit monetero. edd byrnes gives a poised performance as clayton, that holds up well. kareen o'hara doesn't get much to do, but is a worthy looker. gerard herter, pedro sanchez and ivano staccioli provide able support.<br /><br />a fun and worthy spaghetti parody/homage that throws one curve-ball after another and many fruitful down 'n' dirty antics.
