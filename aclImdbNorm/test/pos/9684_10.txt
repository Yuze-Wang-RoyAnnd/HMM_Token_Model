i love everything about family guy.<br /><br />my favourite characters in family are brian and stewie and i like the episodes when it mainly features them such as "road to rhode island" (season 2), as they interact very well. the comments they make just have me in stitches. peter's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things he does "are just so brilliant they're retarded." the voice acting is excellent, especially seth macfarlane as he provides the voices for half of the griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour glenn quagmire and how he manages this range (particularly with singing) i just don't know. he deserves his two emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius stewie. adam west also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of quahog. what i like about chris (voiced by seth green) is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense.<br /><br />the only thing i have found annoying is that in the uk fox has decided to change the seasons to increase dvd sales, which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing.<br /><br />if you enjoy family guy then i would thoroughly recommend seth macfarlane's other project american dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious.
