my children, dd 7 and ds 10, enjoyed the movie so much they were squirming in their seats. it was good, old fashioned, rated g, family fun. this movie was made for kids.... someone really understands them.<br /><br />it was fun to see julia roberts, brice willis, garth brooks and the other stars make their cameo appearances.<br /><br />as someone who lives in the city the fictional "big texas" was modeled after, i can say that they did an honest and accurate portrayal. the kids looked like kids, not like superstars.<br /><br />i hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to hollywood that we need more movies like this. go see it, then spread the word!
