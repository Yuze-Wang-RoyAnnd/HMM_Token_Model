as over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable), king of queens is a very original, unique and astoundingly funny alternation. it's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in manhattan in queens, ny. with them lives carrie's father arthur, a picture-book extrovert, who is played by the fantastic jerry stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears. other important people are their best friends deacon and kelly, a married couple, and their other friend spence who's almost 30 and still lives with his mother. what makes this show so unique and funny is, above all, that every single character seems so real and carrie's cynical, sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of doug's good-natured, slightly dumb optimism.and arthur's the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable with his strange ideas and habits. he often gets himself into trouble and doug and carrie have to drag him out of the mud. even if in my opinion the quality of the show decreased a little within the last years it's still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. it takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them, but after that's done, you get some unstoppable laughs from it. although i think i couldn't survive one day with arthur in a closed room without beating the guts out of him, i really adore him in this show. watch and have fun, i give it a 9 out of 10.
