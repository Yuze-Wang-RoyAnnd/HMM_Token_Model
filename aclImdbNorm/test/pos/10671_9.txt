i'm a huge space buff, and at nearly 44, i've just discovered this flick for the first time. i came at it in a roundabout way from space 1999, then ufo. i went hunting for other anderson creations and found this was their first live-action work. what a home run! i actually heard about this movie many years ago, but never knew what it was called, so i'm happy to have found it by accident.<br /><br />these andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing, the execution of the completely believable and realistic-looking models, the quality of acting, etc.<br /><br />i don't think it looks dated at all. let me tell you... i'll take good old models over the fake-looking cgi crap of today any time! seriously, most of the rocket scenes looked pretty real. they had it down to a science! if you choose to think of what you are looking at as real, it isn't hard to actually believe it.<br /><br />also, the amount of detail in set designs, the beautiful photography, the whole look... man, i wish i could go back to that time! they knew how to make great movies in the 60's. personally, i've lost all interest in hollywood movies today. anybody with a budget can do cgi. i hate it! bring back the models! think of all the people that style employed! anyway, i am ranting. :-) if you like good sci-fi that's very well-done, you will do yourself a service by watching this.
