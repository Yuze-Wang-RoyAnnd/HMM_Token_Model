there's only so much that i can take of filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that nasaan ka man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. it's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie milan. the fact that there's only so few filipino movies that i really like. i think cholo laurel did such a great job in this movie. i truly truly loved this movie, technically and character development wise; the plot was complex and that's what made it terrific.
