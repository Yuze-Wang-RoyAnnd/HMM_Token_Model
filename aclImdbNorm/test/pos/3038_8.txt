this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... realistic. movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. the producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. the lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. at least that's how it seemed at the time. in today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. there would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic. the sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.
