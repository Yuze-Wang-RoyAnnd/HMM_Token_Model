hmm, is it right to compare tiffani thiessen and mark-paul gosselaar's post saved by the bell acting? of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. and is right to give this movie a `10' rating? hahahahahaha... that's funny. this movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than i expected it to be. made-for-tv movies are often so so so similar. so many of them have the same feel to them. this one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story. before it started i had envisioned ms. thiessen as a vixen type 90210 seductress but here she was as innocent as kelly kapowski which was refreshing. eric close surprised me by playing his part really well. with some decent writing the director got a pretty good, convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy. all in all it was somewhat interesting, definitely better than most tv movies. my grade: b-
