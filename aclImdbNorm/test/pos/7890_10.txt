i only voted excellent because this film took two snapshots of americana: one in 1970, and one for every year afterward. <br /><br />nothing's really changed.<br /><br />joe is actually a jerk, a big stupid slob who's mad at everybody else in the world for his own idiocy. this ain't really a spoiler, but the key to the film is the big, corporate "never does wrong" guy making friends with this semi-troglodyte joe, and he gets some kind of...validation from his bigotry and stupidity and sense of being wronged. <br /><br />yet, few would argue, that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die. and those kids shouldn't have ripped joe and compton off. and joe and compton were actually getting into the hash and the young skin until they got ripped off. a simple film in many ways, except that in 1970 new york city was par to a battle zone thanks to nixon's care, and all of the money going to the war in vietnam. as i write this (2/25/2007) there is a "very long wait" on netflix for this film - which makes me happy because i think there are people out there who want to learn. this was a pretty good snapshot - not exact, a bit caricaturist - but actually pretty close to how it was back then. and the scary thing is - things haven't changed that much. sure, there's no more welfare, but that just means the wage-slavery has won out. <br /><br />amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money, then complain that $5.15 an hour is too much to pay their people.
