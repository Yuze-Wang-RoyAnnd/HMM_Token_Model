personally, i regard "the egyptian" in an extremely favourable light.<br /><br />it was introduced to me by a well-known australian movie commenter & critic named bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. this movie fitted the bill perfectly & i came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as i watched it, as i was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.<br /><br />to me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production! yes, i am aware of its flaws! but it was so enticing
