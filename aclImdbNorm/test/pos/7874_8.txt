this was a rather unnerving look at an ostensibly functional family confronted by their daughter's druggie boyfriend. father tangles with and ultimately kills druggie boyfriend. wallowing in guilt he reveals to a drunk redneck what he has done. things spiral rapidly out of hand before degenerating completely. the ending you dread stalks the viewer throughout, but is still able to startle when it finally arrives.
