so let's begin!)))<br /><br />the movie itself is as original as cronenberg's movies would usually appear...<br /><br />my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses. she is as lovely as usual, this cutie!<br /><br />i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers. still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow. <br /><br />the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array. ;)<br /><br />recommend with confidence!))))
