swinging bachelor matthau, a successful dentist, is stringing along his blond mistress hawn, having told her that he's a married man with three kids. after she attempts suicide matthau decides to get responsible and marry the girl. worried that she's going to be a "homebreaker", bright eyed hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her. matthau employs his faithful nurse bergman to act his wife and that's when things really get complicated.<br /><br />a farcical comedy with irresistible leads quite often hits the mark but isn't for one second believable. the script asks us to believe that us men are such one-dimensional turds that it's truly beyond belief. but maybe this comedy doesn't need to be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy the ever so funny matthau, the ever so charming bergman and d'ebutant hawn, who here basically created the dumb-blond girl role.
