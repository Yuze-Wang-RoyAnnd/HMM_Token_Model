this is one of my all time favourite films. its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest. i always throw on this film if i'm going on holiday, or if i don't want to go to the gym, just seeing nikki's gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need. its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be everyones cup of tea, but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy, romance and an interesting plot you will love it. it is filled with great characters and ben and nikki are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing. bottom line......you have to give it a try! i watched it on tv one day by fluke and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday. my father the hero i love you!!!
