these immortal lines begin the jack starret directed masterpiece,'the dion brothers'. the plot centers around two blue collar west virginian brothers (stacy keach and frederic forrest) who commit robberies in hopes of using the money to open a seafood restaurant!!? what follows is quite an adventure, and many comedic events ensue. the action scenes are all top notch and consist of some nicely realized shootouts. the latter of which is absolutely amazing and occurs in an abandoned building being demolished by a wrecking ball! the film was written by now famous director terrence malick and features an early appearance by margot kidder. all in all, an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the finest action/comedy hybrids every made. hopefully it gets a decent widescreen dvd release soon.
