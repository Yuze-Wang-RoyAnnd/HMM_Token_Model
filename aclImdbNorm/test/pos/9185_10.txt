last evening i had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie hitch. i was stunned and amazed. will smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with. he proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. kevin james was also very impressive. i admit that i've always like him on "the king of queens" but this role really brought him into the light more, and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. the movie was funny and adorable and i recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. the mix of comedy, romance, and drama left me feeling complete. it's nothing like most "chick flicks" in the sense of tears and sadness, but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females. i encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from hitch. <br /><br />two way big thumbs up!!!
