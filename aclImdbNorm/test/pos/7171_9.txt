this movie just screened on channel seven - australian tv - today.<br /><br />in my opinion, it was a very interesting take on how the nazi's treated the russian jews as mercilessly as everywhere else.<br /><br />kellie martin did a really great job, and her tears and frustration as "frusia" were quite convincing.<br /><br />the holocaust is a part of our history that we must not forget. schindlers list wasn't the first - and it wont be the last - account of survival and courage in that five year nightmare. my family is dutch, and i will always applaud any movie makers who want to keep the candlelight alive by telling of someone's courage to stand up and help those who were being abused, violated and murdered for being "a jew."
