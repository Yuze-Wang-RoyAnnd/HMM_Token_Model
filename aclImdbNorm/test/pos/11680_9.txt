absolutely one of the 10 best music films ever! a totally essential educational experience for any music fanatic--especially young rock/punk fans today...understanding the beginnings of any particular "artistic" movement absolutely requires understanding the roots of the music,as well as the mindset and musical environment of the times....not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time. and,besides all that,this documentary is flat-out rock-n-roll f u n !! do not miss it!!! that said,can anyone tell me when,if ever, "the decline of western civilization"...part 1,( not part 2,the metal version) will be made available again..hopefully on dvd?
