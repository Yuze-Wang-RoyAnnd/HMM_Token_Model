well every scene so perfectly presented. never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.<br /><br />well while i was watching this movie i remembered watching "amilie". amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. these movies are both based on a same plot line. but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.<br /><br />red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. and i am still thinking about it.<br /><br />the story is great and the ending is a bit funny. i was laughing in the end scene. well funny how this three movie red white and blue are connected.<br /><br />all in all a great work of art. a work of a masterman.<br /><br />10/10
