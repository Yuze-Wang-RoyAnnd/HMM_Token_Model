all risto jarva's films are worth of seeing. some like "j"aniksen vuosi" and "loma" are best films in their genre and have reached a status of a classics in finnish cinema-history.<br /><br />most people have formed a impression of actor antti litja through jarva's films. litja acted leading role in three of jarva's films which all became successes at box office and movie reviews.<br /><br />it's nice to see that idea of "j"aniksen vuosi" still lives in commercials (i think it was tele-operator sonera's tv add where litja was walking in mountain fell at lapland with hare in his arms. everibody who has seen the film knows what i am talking about..) "j"aniksen vuosi" is a beautiful film with great actors and good filming locations - like famous small town in lappland, sodankyl"a, where the best film festival in the world is held - the midnight sun film festival. i recommend it for all to go there on june - but remember warm clothes and raincoat :)
