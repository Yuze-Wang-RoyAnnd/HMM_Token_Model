i went it to see this film with caution. a suicidal "comedy" didn't seem consistent. having a brother who is has attempted suicide and seeing the devastation that has caused our whole family, i know first hand how crushing it can be to deal with this issue. i must say - this film deals with it in a way that allows the viewer "inside" someone who is suffering and simply doesn't know why, or how to stop it. while the film is not perfect, it respects the subject matter and more importantly makes it accessible for the masses. i know for our family, humor has helped us through a lot of the pain. and, max and grace is just what it portends to be - a suicidal comedy. it's funny - and, i also felt that characters were real and vibrant. it's also extremely intelligent, yet simple. it cuts to the chase and i appreciate that! i give it a 9 and will recommend it.
