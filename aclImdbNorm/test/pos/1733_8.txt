as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i had heard of the series in passing, i never really realized exactly what it was. it was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like arthur dent (from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy) but cooler. i can't believe what i've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before? my entire childhood was deprived of doctor who adventures; me being a tremendous fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. honestly, i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes.<br /><br />i have to admit that at first i was not so sure that billie piper would be the best actress but i'm happy to say that she did very well, i thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. i think, actually, that was one of my favourite aspects of the series; the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the south london council estate life. i'm always interested in instances where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives. i also loved christopher eccleston. i haven't seen many of his films and i've never seen another actor as dr who, but i thought his portrayal of the doctor was brilliant, immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder. i find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seems slightly shallow. this doctor, on the other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. i agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects, aliens and whatnot, might have been a bit more effective. but then again, this isn't about special effects (though they help) from what i've read and heard from long-time dr who fans; it's the spirit of the whole things that really counts. and i don't think they did a bad job with what they had. i quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the daleks; if i ever knew anything about dr who before watching the series, it was that there were things in it that looked like upturned dustbins on wheels. previous to watching, i was quite sceptical about these pepper-pots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary! which i loved,of course.<br /><br />overall, a good show. i look forward to future episodes with delight. the doctor has a new fan.
