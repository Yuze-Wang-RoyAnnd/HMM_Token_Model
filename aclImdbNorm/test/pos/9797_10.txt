i am a 20 year old bloke from england. i don't cry at films. but this one moved me. i cried like a girl! this is absolutely the most moving film i have ever seen, even though the story was questionable. joseph mazello's little face when he dreams of crying made me sob every time. how could anyone hurt such a sweet looking kid? i'm going to cry now just thinking about it! remarkable.
