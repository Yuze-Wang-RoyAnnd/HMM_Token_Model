i first was made aware of this film when i saw a preview before another movie. i was intrigued but it didn't get to see it before it's short run in theaters was done.<br /><br />it is not an easy movie to watch multiple times. there is much violence inflicted upon unarmed civilians. there are lessons to be learned here. one of patricia arquette's lines sums up on. "to americans if it didn't happen on tv it just didn't happen" there is a lot of truth to that.<br /><br />another is that at one point she thinks that just because she announces she is an american citizen that soldiers will part and let her pass. it doesn't work that way.<br /><br />the scenery is beautiful. the acting is all decent. the professor is especially good. mainly though i care about these characters. francis mcdormand and spaulding gray are fine but their appearance is short, so they don't matter much. patricia has guts. in the hands of a lesser actor this could have turned out very badly. as it is love or hate the movie you should still come away with the idea that there still exist military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of our own is hurt we ignore their oppression.<br /><br />aung san suu kyi, is the female political leader in the movie. in real life she won the nobel peace prize. she was only recently released from house arrest. the w. bush administration, as of the date i write this, is attempting to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and re-form the government. the burmize government was under such scrutiny that is changed the name of the country to the maynamar republic. the u.s. government has yet to recognzie the new name.<br /><br />if you don't wnat a message in your movie don't watch this one. if you don't mind a little educations with your entertainment then it's a fine one.
