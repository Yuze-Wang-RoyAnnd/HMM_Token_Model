this is a great film in many different ways...perhaps the most important is that it introduces western audiences to the remarkable, tragic story of aung san suu kyi and her fight for freedom and democracy. wonderful acting, gorgeous cinematography, breathtaking action and suspense: "beyond rangoon" has everything. i've seen this movie several times over the last ten years and each time it means more to me. not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating on imdb), but that's because it is not conventional hollywood dumbtainment; rather, it challenges the viewer on several levels. i've never watched it without sobbing at the end and promising to live a more meaningful life.
