this adaptation for tv was a wonderful vehicle for bill irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. with the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer/director, bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices.<br /><br />although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft, it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages.<br /><br />this work was televised as a pbs special. bill performed a piece of it on the tonight show, but out of context it did not go over well.
