this production was quite good. the usual fabulous scenery, interesting, quirky characters. it was just so strange not to have captain hastings, miss lemon, and poirot's office/residence, so prominently featured in the original pbs/bbc mysteries.<br /><br />in the original series, so much took place at the office. hastings reading the paper, while poirot "exercises his little gray cells." miss lemon pitching in whenever needed.<br /><br />poirot without capt. hastings would be like holmes without watson ... he can most certainly solve the crime, but it is not as interesting.<br /><br />and what would a poirot mystery be without hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling for some beautiful, unattainable woman.
