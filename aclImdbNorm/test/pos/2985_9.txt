i'm certain that people from usa don't know anything about the rest of the world, but i think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the usa. the only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and islamic nations. in france, for instance, the age of consent is 15. in brazil it's 14. in spain it's 12. so the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal. nudity isn't considered big deal in almost all civilized countries. and only a freak could consider a teenagers' love as child molestation.
