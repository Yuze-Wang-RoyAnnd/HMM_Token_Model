perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the usa, "duckman" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons.<br /><br />unlike the often innocuous criticism found in "the simpsons" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in "south park," every bit of this series follows a plan. the criticism of us society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series.<br /><br />the cultural references in "duckman" also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). in that, it is different from "the simpsons," which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff often hidden in "duckman." as other people writing about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (bernice, duckman and cornfed). also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like "the once and future duck" ('you'll love her until the end of your days...') and in "bev takes a holiday" (when he takes a chance to tell beverly all those things he couldn't tell beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality.<br /><br />one can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.<br /><br />all in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the usa and one of the best series ever. i doubt it will ever be on dvd though. far too many things the duck said make much more sense today.
