surprisingly good film made in the wake of the exorcist concerning a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she goes to a de-sanctified church to restore a life size and life like crucified man . the piece was christ and the two thieves, however christ was long ago sold off. trouble starts once the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come to life and seduce the woman. from that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul. creepy, scary and much better than you think the film works because its cast sells the events which are decidedly adult. it helps that these are real people who are flawed so its easier to relate to them. i really liked this film, and seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade i was shocked at how good it is. definitely better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles makes it seem.
