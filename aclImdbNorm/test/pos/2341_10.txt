a truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life. it could be set in any town in the uk. <br /><br />i live in a housing estate in glasgow and can relate to this film very well.<br /><br />sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable.<br /><br />the actors are scarily believable, i felt as if i was spying on my neighbours. it was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. i was very moved by a few scenes.<br /><br />i loved the way this film was shot.<br /><br />overall this film is a must see.
