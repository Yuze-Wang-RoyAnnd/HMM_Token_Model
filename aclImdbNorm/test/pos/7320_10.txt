this is the third three stooges short that the team ever made, and like a lot of their early ones, this is absolutely and totally hysterical! now owning it on dvd as part of the three stooges collection vol. 1, whenever i feel like it, i watch this! <br /><br />in this short film, moe, larry, and curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone, but boy, they end up making a mess out of everything!<br /><br />this short is another one of my all time favorite three stooges shorts, i also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the three stooges are the kings of slapstick! <br /><br />when i heard that it got nominated for the academy award for best short film, i really became curious about this, when i heard that it had lost, i was very disappointed about it! <br /><br />this short is one of the three stooges funniest by far, i extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot! <br /><br />10/10
