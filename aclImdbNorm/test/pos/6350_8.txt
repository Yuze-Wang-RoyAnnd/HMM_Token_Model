this story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner, something which sets it apart from most films with this plot. mr. lam (jacky cheung) has a relationship with choy (karena lam, who was also so good in "koma") in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation. he is married for 20 years to ching (the great anita mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship. when ching offers to care for hers and mr. lam's former teacher, choy and mr. lam have the opportunity to be together. what makes the film so good is director ann hui's pacing. it takes a while to uncover the secrets of the lamsm and it all makes sense. the movie is very dramatic and touching. you don't feel any repulsion about the teacher/student situation, something that elevates this film above many with the same plot. it is slow moving, but stay with it. also, revel in ms. mui's wonderful, unglamorous but beautiful performance. she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time. it is worth the time to witness and just be there with her.
