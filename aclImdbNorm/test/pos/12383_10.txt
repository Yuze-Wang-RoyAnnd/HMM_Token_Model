this is better then the first. the movie opens up with sheriff sam .then, sam and anne pack there bags up and head to the tropicana while jack tags along.<br /><br />people are shot, get glass through necks, get squished by anvils, get stabbed with icicles, eyes gouged out, head explosions, drownings, hangings, lobsters shoved into faces, slit throats, freezing to death, killed by snowballs, arms are ripped off, melted by anti-freeze, icicles down necks, hit in face with pots and pans, fingers getting' bitten off, icicles through mouths, bitten on the neck, exploding people, toasted snowballs, and shoved in blenders.<br /><br />the snowballs are hilarious, they put it into a blender and turn it on, then it says 'that was fun' they put in in a waffle thing and it gets burnt. <br /><br />this is just a great movie. then they start thinking of other ways to kill it, and the snowball replies, 'that's not nice'<br /><br />it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this.<br /><br />10 out of 10 stars.
