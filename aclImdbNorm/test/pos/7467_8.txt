i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from (one of?) the executive producer at the atlantic film festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us.<br /><br />filmed in atlantic canada, the movie is about three teen-aged girls who in one of their last summers of their youth, devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30-year old man, despite much protestation.<br /><br />it's definitely worth a watch, but the humour was geared a completely different demographic than the one i inhabit (male 18-25), so i was shaking my head at the character's antics rather than laughing. inspite of this, the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining, without so much laughing.
