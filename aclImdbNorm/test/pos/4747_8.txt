this is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but it again has roy scheider, right after he did "french connection", playing a cop with the name 'buddy'. they also use the same too-memorable wheelman from "bullitt". at first you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory. the car chase is a great one, but as in many car movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. check "puppet on a chain" and "french connection ii" for some other good, long, intense chases.
