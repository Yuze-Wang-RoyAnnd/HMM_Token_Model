watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. this is what today's documentaries are all about. it's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. mr. block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. it's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. this film treads very carefully and quite successfully.<br /><br />one would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. quite the opposite: it made me feel good. i feel that i now know more about marriage...about women.<br /><br />definitely check this out, it'll make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do.
