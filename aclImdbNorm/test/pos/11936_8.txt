colombian terrorists hold hostage a military school in the u.s. until their demands are met. the students decide to fight back. will they be able to do it?<br /><br />silly premise but the film actually works. the group of kids who fight were all up and coming when this film came out in 1991: sean astin (looking very cute); wil wheaton (looking miserable); keith coogan; george perez (the token latino who is very handsome, very muscular and is mostly shown in nothing but tight underwear); t.e. russell (the token black guy) and shawn phelan. none of them are very good actors (except astin), but who cares? this is a mindless action film. the only other good performances are from denholm elliott (having a ball as the headmaster) and louis gossett jr. as the dean.<br /><br />other than that--there's lots of action, suspense, explosions and little brains. in other words---fun! <br /><br />only complaint (and this is minor)--it's a bit too long (there are three endings) and there is lots of casual, bloody violence (the r rating was well-earned). still, i enjoyed it a lot.
