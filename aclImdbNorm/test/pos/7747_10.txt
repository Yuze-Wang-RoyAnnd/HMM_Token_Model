i thought this movie was fun. i have never really watched old movies before and this one was a really great first date film. it had warmth and heart and spirit. was kind of cheesy but in today's film industry, cheesy is cute. i gave it a ten and i highly suggest renting, buying or seeing the movie anyway you can. gene kelly was very dreamy and a little bit sarcastic and you knew the character thought that he was gonna have it all. the female lead was cast perfect because their two personalities had spark and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen. the grandma in the movie was priceless. the perfect addition to a great old movie. i love the fact it was black and white and gene kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't help liking him. see it.
