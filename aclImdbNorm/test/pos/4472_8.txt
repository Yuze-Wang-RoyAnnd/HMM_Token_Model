i love this movie, though i don't like how they picture egyptians, being an egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.<br /><br />the relationship between augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.<br /><br />a very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch augustin's reaction.. <br /><br />all in all i find it enjoyable, and i'm looking forward to reading the short story by balzac.
