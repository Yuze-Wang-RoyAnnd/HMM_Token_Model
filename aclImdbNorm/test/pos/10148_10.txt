1956's the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment. to those who prefer the 1934 original, i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier. however, even though the american version was (heaven forbid!) a big budget blockbuster, i believe it blows the british version out of the water. i think this is one of hitchcock's 10 best-no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. i find so many things to love:<br /><br />1)james stewart, america's favorite everyman for so many years, does an excellent job playing the distressed father here. he can make any film enjoyable, and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story, he had me rooting for him very intensely. leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparison.<br /><br />2)doris day. yes doris day. despite all the criticisms directed toward her, i think she makes the loving wife/mother an extremely sympathetic person. i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character; just because she is soft-spoken and gentle it doesn't mean she is docile and helpless. i don't want to spoil anything, but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed. she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first one, and for those who care about that this version is the way to go. and i loved que sera sera; i think it is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard and deservedly won its oscar. it elevated the film to another level.<br /><br />3)the albert hall sequence. i don't think it was too long at all; i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. and the assassin was truly frightening. <br /><br />4)the ending really put a smile on my face; even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again. the last line in the film is highly amusing. i don't think the film started out slowly; hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the mckennas and he did a great job. i wasn't a huge fan of the kid playing hank, but i didn't have a problem with him. since hank was ben and jo's kid i cared about him too; it's not like he was a brat or anything. <br /><br />i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues. way to go hitch!
