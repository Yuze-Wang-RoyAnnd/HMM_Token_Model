saw this film when it was an entry in santa fe film festival. heavy film! depiction of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another level of the extreme, might have left me depressed to the extreme, had it not been for very funny sight gags and dialogue along the way which lightened the film's overall tone. the relatively "uplifting" ending gave hope for those affected by the initial tragedy. still, i did not walk out of the theatre ready to go to a fun party. the film stayed with me for several days.<br /><br />brought back memories of "ordinary people", but with humor mixed in with the tragedy. i thought the acting was excellent, especially by sigourney weaver and emile hirsh. how each character dealt with the tragedy was at times sad, self-defeating, but also at times hilarious. clever dialogue, and situations.
