i wish hollywood would make more movies like the china syndrome. because this one scores on every level. <br /><br />it has an intelligent, believable script. it shows you that it's not only nuclear power itself, but the money involved in it, that causes danger. and the movie also gives you a great behind-the-scenes look of how television is made.<br /><br />it scores as a thriller: the first time i saw it, it kept me right on the edge of my seat. and it scores as a character-movie: i really cared for the main characters. jane fonda, michael douglas, wilford brimley and, most of all, jack lemmon are great.
