first, don't be fooled by my family name. my mother was full blooded italian, so i really know italian families, and i love mobster movies, even the funny ones like this.<br /><br />for those people who have bad rapped this film (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what good is. this is a damn funny and well-styled film. the fact that almost nobody is italian in it is part of the joke, so far as i can see. and what red-blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of michelle pfieffer? puh-lease! when i saw this film it won me over with the opening song by rosemary clooney who was as irish as one can get, but her pronunciation of the italian words in "mambo italiano" is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. (hell, i even bought the record the next day because of it.) just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that i have personally seen in my relatives houses, though not in the same place (which i found hysterical) sold it for me.<br /><br />this movie is like goodfellas on laughing gas. i just wonder why there are no burger worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? my guess is the crew ate it. "the fries are crispy. the shakes are creamy." my mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous ms. pfieffer. (and i never trusted clowns anyway.) and the three best things about this film are mercedes ruehl's achingly funny mob wife spurned, dean stockwell as her philandering husband tony "the tiger" and last, but definitely not least, the great mugging by oliver platt who should get more comic roles. and note to myself: find out where that black chick went. ouch! why does she work so infrequently? this picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be.
