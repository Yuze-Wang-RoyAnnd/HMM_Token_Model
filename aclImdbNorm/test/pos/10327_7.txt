this film got roasted by the boys at mst3k, but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low-budget film noir. the plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the pacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is bolstered by several fine character actors. true, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but he's actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind. the scenes between him and his dad are quite powerful, in a minimalist kind of way. sure it's depressing, but that's the point. good movie.
