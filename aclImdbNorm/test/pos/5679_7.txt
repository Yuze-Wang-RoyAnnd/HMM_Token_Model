like most, i thought 'another crocodile movie'. so far we've had primeval and rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do that's new? where both those films were about action and violence, this one's about fear and tension.<br /><br />the performances aren't oscar-worthy when there's nothing going on, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much it's like torture. there are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don't really behave like this as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective it's a stretch to say you'll enjoy this movie. it'll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ.
