hal hartley has been likened to a modern day william shakespeare, by virtue of the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter. he certainly knows how to assemble a cast and once again martin donovan is sensational, whilst thomas jay ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable. although the film is only 1 hour, the time frame works wonderfully and keeps the audience on a fast tracked race right till the very end. without a doubt hal hartley is one of the best directors to come out of america in the last 20 years, with a vision that is unique, funny and heart warming.
