considered by many to be a strangely overlooked chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor. not as overtly sexy, violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant odour. ms audran, not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother, donald pleasence does a cameo as a child molester, david hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother, sister and niece. no not very nice at all and chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal (like it might be in some small french village!) instead of ed mcbain's new york city. had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film. here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement. very watchable
