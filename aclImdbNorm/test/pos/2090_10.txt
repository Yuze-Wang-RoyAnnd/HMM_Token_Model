highly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies. great acting, perfectly surreal awkward humor, requisite prison sh-t, accurate depiction of the male condition. music is also spot-on. i think the artist is "dip" but not sure. the short loop of the title credit song on the dvd menu is well-timed, and sounds like slint. (one thing to know is that imdb maintains a ridiculous policy of a minimum comment length based on, not characters, not words, but rather lines. measuring post quality and quantity based on lines in the bold era of unicode and flexible, web-based typography, is like smoking poles.) ! your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. please see the guidelines. attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions.
