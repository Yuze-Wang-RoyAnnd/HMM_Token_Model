gray can make the english language jump through hoops like none other. he recounts a number of events, tied together by his writing of a manuscript (the "monster" of the title), some sad, some uproariously funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic manner. if you liked "swimming to cambodia" you will love this one. i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than "swimming to cambodia". a real masterpiece.
