general trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the enterprise. a lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening, and trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder. he seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment (though a few hundred years out of date) in which to play out his fantasies. the environment is subtly inauthentic, and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies. pretty soon it becomes clear that trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible one. regardless of how you feel about this one, stick around for the twilight zone-like ending. it is well worth it.<br /><br />as many have pointed out, trelayne's character inspired the more developed and amusing on-going character q - and you can see in john delancie's construction of that personality more than just shades of campbell's trelayne. it is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen coping with q all deal with him so radically differently.
