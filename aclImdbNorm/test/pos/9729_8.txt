and she really was beautiful (laraine day, that is) - herself, her part, and her performance. an engaging story of selfish vs. selfless love, for the same man, wealthy heartthrob and dipsomaniac robert cummings. one of his bouts of inebriation leads to an incident that enrages the local community and tests the mettle of the two sisters (jean muir and laraine day) that are close to him (and to each other). their comfortable and somewhat superficial milieu is up-ended as the two girls confront the ensuing crisis and respond to its conflicting demands of prudence, integrity, loyalty, and love, with consequences that are profoundly different for each of them. with the old vanities and niceties abandoned, their real characters are revealed in enthralling contrast.<br /><br />a wonderful find on tcm!
