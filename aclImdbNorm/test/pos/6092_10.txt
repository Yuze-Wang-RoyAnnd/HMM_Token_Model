i've seen a few movies in my time, but this one is exceptional. you'll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it, it is emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion at it's most extreme and it's cinematography is just breathtaking. the character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed, the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted. the film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days. it combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all in one. this movie is unmissable, all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice. hats off to michael ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based.
