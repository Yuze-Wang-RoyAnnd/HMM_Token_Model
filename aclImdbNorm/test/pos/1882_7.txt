i haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since star wars episode iii. both shows sold out, and for good reason. the man with the screaming brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (hey, i'm a dork too.) <br /><br />bruce campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! the movie was cheesy in the best possible way. it may be the funniest movie that bruce has done. ted raimi steals the show with his bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot! who knew that ted could rap? <br /><br />i changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. there is nothing funnier than a robot...doing the robot.<br /><br />as for bruce's performance: "i take the 5th." thanks bruce. thanks for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all of the fun.
