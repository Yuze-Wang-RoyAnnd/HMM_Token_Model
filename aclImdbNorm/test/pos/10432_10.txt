this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched. at the age of 12 i was up late and ran across the movie. it was on the usa channel, gilbert godfrey's up all night. i will never forget. at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues, some sexual. you know 12 is a very rough and weird age. it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl, and being a young lady. this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me. i now have a daughter that is 12. have been searching for a couple years for this movie. if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy. would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age.
