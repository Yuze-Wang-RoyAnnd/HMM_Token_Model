ascending to power in 1933, hitler and his "national socialist german workers party", which of course we all know as the nazis, tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by. early in their rough-shod trampling of the german people, they called any and all artists, newspaper men and film makers into their nazi hq in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared "third reich" (aka 'empire') expected of them.<br /><br />when the master director from the german cinema's silent impressionist and expressionist era, mr. fritz lang, was called in to meet with herr goebels; he listened attentively and said nothing. immediately after leaving the minister of propaganda's office, herr lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to paris. not even going back to his residence, fritz lang did not return to germany (at least not until many years later. he remained in france; eventually immigrating to the united states of america.* <br /><br />mr. lang went right to work in america; creating a variety of most enjoyable, solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year. included in this sm"orgasbord of titles is today's lucky subject, western union (20th century-fox, 1941).<br /><br />typically a film about the old west and pioneer days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast. western union qualified on both requisites. we are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses.<br /><br />heading up the playbill are robert young, randolph scott, dean jagger and virginia gilmore. others prominently displayed are folks like john carradine (playing not a vampire or other scary guy, but a physician), george "slim" summerville (veteran character actor, silent film veteran and graduate of mack sennett's keystone comedies), chill wills (always dependable supporting player and former singer in "the avalon boys") and burly bad guy barton maclane. added to this mix, we have names like russell hicks, victor killian, minor watson, george chandler, addison richards, irving bacon, james flavin, francis ford, frank mcgrath and kermit maynard (ken maynard's bro).<br /><br />prominent in those american indians featured are: chief big tree, chief thundercloud and mr. jay silverheels. also featured is that one great representative of the aboriginal peoples of north america is that great, singularly impressive and memorable example of the red man, the louisiana native, iron eyes cody (born espera decorti of sicilian immigrant parents).<br /><br />the filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in arizona and utah and rendered in the highest grade of technigolour available. (there is no monument valley; but then, that's the province of mr. john ford.) in some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think; for it took a sort of pulp magazine story, adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre-war america of the late thirties and early forties. all of this being done by a german born director who was only had been in hollywood and america for the shortest length of time.<br /><br />in its final analysis, western union, while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the western genre; we just don't care. it scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies! so, who really cares about little details such as "accuracy"? <br /><br />we give mr. lang and 20th century-fox a rating of ****!<br /><br />note: * we just saw a special on pbs station wttw, here in chicago that was all about all of the film actors, directors and other artisans whom the nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in america and hollywood. (it seems that movie folks and scientists were the biggest export for germany at this particular time; being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future nasa people, came from europe at this time.) <br /><br />poodle schnitz!!
