the beatles had just done 'magical mystery tour.' there was the general feel that performance, peace and drugs went together naturally. in la, there was a film subculture that knew something was up. nicholson was in several of these gangs.<br /><br />before he decided to seriously become an actor, before 'easy rider,' before 'pink flamingos,' before 'day for night,' there were several experiments with what to do about this. an important one is 'saragossa manuscript.' this is another.<br /><br />jack writes. he plays with circular narrative, self-reference, film reference, performance self-loathing, the pain of creation, all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop. you must see this, if only to know something about jack.<br /><br />certain actors act by digging into themselves. it is a common technique. some dig deep, but after a while, they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people. there isn't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career. think of deniro and hackman.<br /><br />others are pretty interesting people, who seem to become more interesting over time. when they dig into the barrel, they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging. think sean penn and jack. at the bottom of jack's barrel, at the end of the thread he spins, as the base of every character is this experimental, risky writer/filmmaker.<br /><br />who cares if it is a bad movie? it is bad because it took risks. watch when a tear is wiped from annette's cheek by the director. it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing, something that i heard marlon laughed about. that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history.<br /><br />there's another reason to watch this. music in film is has a strong root in dance. revolution in film often relies on music. whole cultures are thus swept along.<br /><br />an unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil. she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music. she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this. but this is one of her earliest screen appearances. you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool 'daddy's girl' segment, over one of nilsson's better songs. (followed by the frank zappa cameo.) mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later.<br /><br />a third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the film: a character named 'lady pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs. she is credited as i. j. jefferson but is really mimi manchu, nicholson's lover at the time and lsd partner. red hair, psychedelic demeanor. lovely. that scene says it all for me, about how jack feels about the boys.<br /><br />ted's evaluation -- 3 of 3: worth watching.
