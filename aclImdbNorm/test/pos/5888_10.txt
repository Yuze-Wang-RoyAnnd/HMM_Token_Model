in a film as successful as this, it is difficult to single out any one factor. all departments work in perfect union to create on of the most moving human dramas ever put on film. <br /><br />the production is a tribute to the ensemble efforts of the writers, producer, cast and crew. to name but a few, the magnificent score of hugo friedhofer is a subliminal marvel, the subtle yet striking photography of greg toland, and the unbelievably effective direction by william wyler all combine with an ideal cast to create an american classic.<br /><br />the dvd format version is a special treat to view. what a pleasure to see "the best years of our lives" so beautifully preserved for generations to come to enjoy.
