suzumiya haruhi no yuuutsu is a very high-rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web. so i really wanted to know why, and i was anything but disappointed.<br /><br />if you can get past the very bizarre (but rather funny) first episode, you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world. a very well drawn, perfectly animated world, that is.<br /><br />i can't tell much of the story without spoiling it, so i'll just say that it's a high school comedy... and yet it's not. i can't really say what it's about, really.<br /><br />seriously, i'm a huge anime fan, and i've got around 50 full series, and i'm not kidding when i say that, even though i haven't finished watching haruhi suzumiya, it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection. i fell in love at first sight with this one, and i assure you that, at the very least, you won't be indifferent to its irresistible charm. trust me, i don't go around giving a 10 to every thing that i watch.
