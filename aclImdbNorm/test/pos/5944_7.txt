if you're going to spoof james bond it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles both sean connery and leonard rossiter so step forward jean dujardin who captures perfectly the connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self-delusion of rossiter thinking he is suave. dujardin plays it like a clouseau who can hold his own at karate. the plot has him looking for our man in schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid. if there is a jarring note it is the leading lady, berenice bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but only just - by aure atika. it's good for one viewing but that's about it.
