the "all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..." scene was a riot. i also guffawed at the scene in the bar where hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the japanese guy and said "pearl harbor buddy". i think my iq is higher than 115, but i'm not sure because i can't count that high.<br /><br />funny thing, this 10 line requirement. seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. i hope i don't make it to 1,000 words before i get to line 10.<br /><br />i'm still two lines short. pardon me while i think and drink, or drink and think. it depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. good, i think i've made it to the 10 line limit. thanks for reading!
