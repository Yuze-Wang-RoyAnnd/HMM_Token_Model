the first time i saw this movie, i just thought "what the hell?" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called motorama! hell yeah! i enjoyed this movie a lot!<br /><br />jordan christopher-michael is a brilliant young actor! it's a shame he stopped act. he interprets very well his character gus on the movie.<br /><br />gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with flea, drew barrymore and meat loaf! want more? <br /><br />ok, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!? just open your mind and let gus drive you into this journey.<br /><br />"motorama gus, you won motorama"
