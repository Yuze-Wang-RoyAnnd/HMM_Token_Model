i would just like to point out (in addition to pleading for the series to be released on dvd) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. these days, with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc. it's nice to get lost in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. pwog fits the bill. was it emmy material? no, but it was awesome just the same.<br /><br />i also have to put a vote in for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of season one. i would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second two, but i was definitely more sucked in by the latter cast. even though the series has been off the air for years, i'll never stop hoping that it be released for purchase.
