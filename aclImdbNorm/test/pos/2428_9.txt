i wouldn't be so sure to accept the dna tests as irrefutable evidence against anna anderson. first, read peter kurth's book on which this film is based. anna anderson knew things that only the real grand duchess anastasia could possibly have known (forensic evidence in anna's favor aside). second, compare the pictures of anastasia and anna anderson. anyone can see that they are one-and-the-same person. third, visit peter kurth's website (url below) where you can read detailed information about the dna tests, as well as why franziska schanzkowska and anna anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the link, "anna-anastasia notes on franziska schanzkowska"). even schanzkowska's relatives believed that their sister and anna anderson were not the same person.<br /><br />i for one will always believe that hih anastasia nicolevna romanova and anna anderson were indeed the same person; i will never be swayed to the contrary .<br /><br />www.peterkurth.com
