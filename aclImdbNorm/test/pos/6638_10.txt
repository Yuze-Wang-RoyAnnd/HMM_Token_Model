this film offers one of the greatest experiences available to movie-goers. it is by no means a pleasant film, but offers realities and emotions the human mind may never have meant to touch upon. it opens pathways in how an individual thinks, and afterwards will change the person forever. <br /><br />the first time i saw this film was in class, and immediately after seeing it i had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to reset my body and mind. i felt devastated and, somehow unreal, as if i didn't exist. it was only a few months later that i was telling one of my friends about shame, and she asked, "oh, is that when you were messed up after seeing it, and ran into me talking all strange about it?" i didn't even remember running into or talking to anyone at all while outside that day, i was astonished. <br /><br />in plot terms it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war. there suffering is greater than that of the dead and by the end...there are no words to complete the image that bergman creates. its like a horrible dream which causes you to wake, altering your own reality forever. this film must be seen.
