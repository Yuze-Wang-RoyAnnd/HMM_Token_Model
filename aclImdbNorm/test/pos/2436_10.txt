almost missed it. while visiting friends in philadelphia sometime in the early 1980`s, i was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. it wasn`t just bogart he was obsessed with; but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well. add to that a plot liken to the maltese falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as i`m concerned. about ten years later it appeared on tv and i taped it. >
