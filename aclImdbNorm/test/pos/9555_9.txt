<br /><br />this is the best mock documentary of a dog show that i have seen in a long time. a very long time. well lets face it,ever. isn't that part of the charm ? the idea of actually going to the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place. even if there were no big laughs, one would still be smirking at the thought. any movie that attempts something new scores highly in my proverbial book. i loved the dogs too !
