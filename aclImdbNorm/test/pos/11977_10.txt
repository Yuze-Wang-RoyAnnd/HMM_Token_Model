this movie is without a doubt the best i have seen in my entire life. the stellar star cast is only an added bonus over the amazing special effects, and profound story and sublime choreography. the movie is about an ancient love affair that folds down into the modern world. two lovers in heaven incur the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. subsequently the woman is born again on earth. while she is in college, she is raped and commits suicide. the rest of the movie basically focuses on the hunting down of the people who were associated with the rape, by her lover who possesses superhuman strength and the mastery of several languages. sonu nigam delivers a very mature and deep performance in this film, and all the other actors do almost as well. te action scenes with akshay kumar are mind-blowing, and must not be missed. you simply have to watch this movie!!!
