i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has. it is a screwball comedy & romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job & even won an oscar.<br /><br />it is ingrid bergman's first film in the us since the 1950's & even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films, she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely. this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks.<br /><br />goldie hawn who won an oscar in this, her first film, as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy, love them & leave them walter mathaw. goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award.<br /><br />this film is not real deep, but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well. not sure why it's average is so low as i give it a solid 8.
