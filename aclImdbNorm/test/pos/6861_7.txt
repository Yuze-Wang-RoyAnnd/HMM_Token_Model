a horror picture set ultimately to parody but still in it's play out could scare a few of those that are frailed nerved or easily disgusted when they see whats under their skin. i laughed at it though. it was easy to decipher the true killer and his acting didn't help. this only led to potente looking even better. anatomie is not much of a horror picture for those foreign of the genre but those contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting peak at german horror cinema. 6/10
