what can be said about one of the greatest n64 games ever? that the action is fast enough to keep even a seasoned fps veteran sweating bullets quite literally? that the graphics are great, down to the explosions that everyone loves to see? that nothing is quite as fun as playing multiplayer mode, and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with submachine guns?<br /><br />very little beats goldeneye 007. about the only thing missing was voice acting, and a bit more intelligence in the enemy soldiers. if you have an n64, and you like shooting people and things crossed with espionage, get a copy of this.
