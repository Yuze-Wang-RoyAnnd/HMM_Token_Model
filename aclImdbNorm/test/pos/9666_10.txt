looking backwards to that year 2002 when "furia" was made, one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today's new generation in romania.<br /><br />the main qualities of "furia" stand in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing, plus a cast of excellent actors. all four leading roles are admirably performed, both with depth and casualness: dragos bucur and andy vasluianu confirmed, since then, being two of our best performers today, dorina chiriac follows them closely, and adrian tuli, a non-professional (in real life, a graveyard manager!) cast as gabonu, was a genuine revelation! <br /><br />further, radu muntean's directing is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of "a fateful night" and inescapable destiny. one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments, since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: "h^artia va fi albastr"a" and "boogie".
