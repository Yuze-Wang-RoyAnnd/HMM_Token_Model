my family and i normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.<br /><br />the trailer of "nasaan ka man" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. the movie exceeded our expectations. the cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. jericho rosales was really very good, so's claudine barretto. the fact that i despised diether ocampo proves he was effective at his role. i have never been this touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? congratulations to star cinema!! way to go, jericho and claudine!!
