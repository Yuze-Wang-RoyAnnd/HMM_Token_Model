i saw this movie once a long time ago, just once, and i didn't know where it had come from, and i looked for about six years to find it, and i finally found it here at imdb.com! just the whole concept of the movie is great, i believe it's got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings, keeping tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity. and the way that he does it,to keep himself from being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertaining. i don't remember exactly how it ended, but i remember, it finished with a great climax, and a good twist.
