i remember seeing this 1978 comedy at one of the bargain matinees i took in when i was looking for a study break from my college courses. walter matthau and glenda jackson do some effective tracy-hepburn-style thrusting-and-parrying in this featherweight romp directed by the reliable howard zieff (he did "private benjamin") about a newly widowed doctor's aggressive re-entry into the dating game. it all breezes by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter julius j. epstein ("casablanca") along with alan mandel, max shulman and future director charles shyer.<br /><br />dr. charley nichols has just come back from hawaii after his wife's death. upon his return, he becomes aware that he is instant catnip to any and all the single women in la. he works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief-of-staff, amos willoughby, whom charley has to pacify to keep his residency. enter ann atkinson, a transplanted englishwoman who bakes cheesecakes for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession, which she expresses freely on a pbs talk show. of course, charley is on the show's discussion panel, and sparks, as they say, fly. this leads to the standard complications about how serious charley is willing to become about ann. at the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potential wrongful death lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under willoughby's careless supervision.<br /><br />it's just refreshing to see such a mature yet bracing love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the scalpel-wielding skill of surgeons. matthau is his usual 1970's curmudgeonly swinger and quite a sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk. away from her heavy, award-winning elizabethan roles, jackson is crisply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the feisty ann, who thinks all doctors should aspire to be albert schweitzer. art carney plays willoughby with predictable bluster, while richard benjamin provides amiable support as charley's colleague, dr. solomon. it's all very compact with a few nice jabs at the greed within the medical profession. there are no extras on the 2005 dvd.
