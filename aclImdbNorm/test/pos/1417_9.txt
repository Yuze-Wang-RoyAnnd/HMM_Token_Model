stephen hawkings is a genius. he is the king of geniuses. watching this movie makes me feel dumb. but it's a great movie. not highly entertaining, but very very intriguing. the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings, a man who makes einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy, and black holes. everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they'v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they'll write it all down. well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig's disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen. watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes. awesome. you won't be the same after you see it.
