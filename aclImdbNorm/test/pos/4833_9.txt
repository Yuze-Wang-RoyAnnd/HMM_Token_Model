this film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe. while it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the world trade center in 1993, seen now post 9/11, it is almost unbearable.<br /><br />it would be a mistake to call this film prophetic, but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me" come alive.<br /><br />our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the world trade center and subsequent readings of the 9/11 report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated.<br /><br />some people have criticized the first and fourth amendments of the us constitution as being partly responsible for the islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans, but that is wrong headed in every possible way.<br /><br />surely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on free speech, a free press or freedom of religion? i certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person's home or office to search without cause or without a warrant.<br /><br />the fact is, the fbi, the ins and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession, but they chose not to for a variety of reasons. besides, no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders. likewise, it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward mecca.<br /><br />consider this, until lee harvey oswald actually fired his rifle at president john kennedy, he wasn't really breaking any laws. living in a free society has its drawbacks.<br /><br />still, path to paradise is a must see film that i am afraid will never be seen by that many people. as far as i know, it is not on dvd and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of it.<br /><br />i'm not really surprised, people don't like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the pettiest of reasons, like jurisdictional squabbles and a refusal to share information.<br /><br />this is a shame as path to paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before, the final scene where ramzi yousef (played by art malik), the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the world trade center after his capture and extradition simply says "next time we will bring them both down", is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes.
