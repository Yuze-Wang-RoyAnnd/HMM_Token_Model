i saw this film at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and director aku louhimies introduced his film and was on hand for q&a after. for some reason this movie is titled frozen land in english so i don't know how the distributors got frozen out of paha. this is a very good film. it doesn't for me have enough that i would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but i did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film. louhimies said that back in finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it. i'm sure some objected to some of the violence, swearing, drug and alcohol abuse and sexual explicate scenes. it's a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle down effect. this film has very interesting and strong characters. i would rate it a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution.
