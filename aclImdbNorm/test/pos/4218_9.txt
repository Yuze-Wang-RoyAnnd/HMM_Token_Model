the movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel. the third was dark, and semi-interesting but it wasn't nearly as fun or enjoyable as this. it is filled with comedic lines about martha stuart, doll's anatomy, masturbation, and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images. the movie wasn't scary or suspenseful and i'm sure that it wasn't the director's intention. it was fun because of the silliness, jennifer tilly's over the top and sexy performance. the puppetry of the dolls were so well handled, the movement of mouth, lips, tears in eyes, knife in chest, and the costumes. the dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more enoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls. the new chucky look was great and tiffany was very cute. a few scenes with chucky hugging the human tiffany even made my father smile. jesse and jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were cool. the ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely. it may not be as suspenseful as movies like halloween h2o or urban legend, but it is certainly more fun!!!!
