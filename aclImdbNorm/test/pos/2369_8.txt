i taped this on sundance and had no idea that it was a miike film. i thought it was just another kung fu movie.<br /><br />then i saw things like the dancing sax player <br /><br />who sounded like an oriental gato barbieri, and i knew this had to be miike.<br /><br />i missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see miike's credits.<br /><br />so far he hasn't disappointed me yet. audition, city of lost souls, ichi the killer and the happiness of the katakuries were all good flicks, and now i've found out that this was the third in a trilogy.<br /><br />other than miike and todd solendz there's nobody making interesting films nowadays.
