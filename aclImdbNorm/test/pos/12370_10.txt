this, unfortunately, is a little-known film.....i say "unfortunately", because it ranks up there with the "classics" of the american silent screen!<br /><br />it's about a legend of a "phantom chariot" that travells all over the world, picking up the souls of those who have died. the legend says tha the last person to die on new year's eve is condemned to drive the chariot for the next whole year.<br /><br />it brings to mind the sequence of the "ghost of future yet to come" in dicken's famous "christmas carol".<br /><br />the double-exposure effects of the ghosts (esp. when they interact with the "live" people) are excellent! <br /><br />if you love silent films, you must see this; it will "blow you away"!<br /><br />norm vogel<br /><br />norm's old movie heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
