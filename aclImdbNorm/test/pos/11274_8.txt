anyone who correctly identifies the opening images as god killing himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest home in transylvania. i would imagine this as being a favorite movie at "twin peaks" dark lodge on movie night if time existed there. i would think that a better title might have been, "how much fun can you have with someone who's almost dead in the forest with only neolithic technology?" the answer, it would seem, is quite a bit. so, despite the silly "god killing himself," the uber-pretentiousness (an apt phrase taken from a previous letter), the more clearly "alistair crowley - hi, i'm the beast, deal with it!" than christian cosmology (i can't believe another viewer had the thick-headedness to see the judeo-christian bible in this)... despite all of that... this is a daring, important work that most people should not see. i am both impressed and creeped out that it was made at all.
