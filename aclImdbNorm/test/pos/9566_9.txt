this film isn't a comedy, its an expose. i've always hated dog shows, considering the ridiculous get-ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them. hence, the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film. i get a kick out of something being taken so seriously, even though the gains are small and insignificant. it's like miniature golf, or jump roping championships or the need to set some obscure world record. the acting was much more refined in this film than waiting for guffman, and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters, who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous. eugene levy was great, as was michael mckean and fred willard. however, it was the dogs who eventually stole the show. but then again, who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway.
