aaah...the thing.<br /><br />to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly unattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. and there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.<br /><br />and i really miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien, the elephant man, poltergeist, the howling, an american werewolf in london, the thing, the company of wolves, a nightmare on elm street...what an era for horror effects! and don't get me started on the death of matte painting. the matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.<br /><br />what do we have now? third rate cgi, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy mtv videos.<br /><br />now i'm going to go netflix 'the howling'.
