my son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and made me watch this with him. as i love documentaries, it didn't take a whole lot of pressure on his part. the whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of dirt-poor kids drift together and end up creating something revolutionary out of thin air - well, more out of some wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf - it just floored me. it still does. i didn't think i would enjoy it the way i did, nor did i think i would tear up watching stacey peralta tear up over the fate of jay adams. and just watching jay adams himself.....the sheer genius of the kid skating and the shrug of the adult remembering. i watched it again last night for what has to be the 10th time and i still get goosebumps watching him fly down the hill with jimi hendrix's "freedom" playing in the background. and i teared up, again. not too many movies have the same impact with me after several viewings. brilliant.
