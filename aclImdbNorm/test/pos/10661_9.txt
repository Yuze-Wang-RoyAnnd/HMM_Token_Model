eisenstein created the russian montage theory, and this film is his finest example. it took years before someone could utilize his ideas and make them work (the limey, 1999). nonetheless, the baby carriage scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of rmt. granted, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the film is amazing. one of the best silent films i have ever seen.
