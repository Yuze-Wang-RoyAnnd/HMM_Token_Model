044: the big trail (1930) - released 10/24/1930; viewed 4/5/06.<br /><br />births: richard harris, harold pinter, robert atkins.<br /><br />doug: in hollywood, raoul walsh unveiled his latest film, the big trail, a western about the trek west across the frontier, starring up-and-coming 23-year-old actor john wayne. in 1930, we are seeing many "firsts" but few "bests." besides the first john wayne film, we have here the first widescreen film (although we only watched the full-frame version). interestingly, the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later: to compete with television, which hadn't yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity. all the same, this film was extremely good, giving us a harrowing look at the trek to oklahoma. the opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind, about america, about the land, who should live on it, etc., and is an excellent demonstration of that. walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the wagon company out in the wilderness (when they reach a cliff, they must rope each wagon down one by one), and we also get a revenge subplot involving wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends (i seem to recall something similar in stagecoach). wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there, and would surely evolve further in subsequent films. since this film is representing all of wayne's early 30's work for the odyssey, we will not see his face again until stagecoach, but once we do, we will keep seeing him to the end of the odyssey and beyond.<br /><br />kevin: ah, our first sound western, and john wayne's first starring role. it's raoul walsh's the big trail. this review will be short, since it's been weeks since i watched it. i enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. the mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises, like when the brains of the bad guys, red flack (tyrone power sr. in his last role) is killed half way through; i thought he would be the boss at the end, but that ended up being bill thorpe (ian keith). i remember that i didn't like the way breck (wayne) kills thorpe and exacts revenge at the end. i understood that that's what he was meant to do in the story, but i really didn't like his reasoning when he tells ruth why he has to do it. i think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was leading through the harsh west.<br /><br />last film viewed: animal crackers (1930). last film chronologically: soup to nuts (1930). next film: l'age d'or (1930).
