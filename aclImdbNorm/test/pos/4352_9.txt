warning: herzog is a filmaker, and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic. so obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character's life, but a filmaker's dramatic embellishment - or so both agreed at the premiere in san francisco. but herzog's usual fascination with character, dreams and perseverance are well suited by this story first published in soldier of fortune, and now a full length autobiographical book. (the soldier of fortune comment brought loud boos from the politically correct sf audience, and both filmaker and main character had to ensure the audience who had just seen the film, that sof's interest was misplaced - so warning, this is not rambo, just survival.)
