for people who are first timers in film making, i think they did an excellent job!! we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north. it was very popular when i was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs. it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema! it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents. the film has just opened, i do hope it does well - people should support this little film. i think this 'vinny...' person is very bitter, about something! and getting too personal
