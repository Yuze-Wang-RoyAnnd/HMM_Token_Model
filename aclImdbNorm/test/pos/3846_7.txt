a group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler.<br /><br />the aristocats is regarded as one of walt disney's finest 2d animations with its charming script and cool characters, but it doesn't quite have the magic that created snow white or the jungle book.<br /><br />the slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin.<br /><br />the young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry, the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with.<br /><br />not the funniest disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments, especially involving the cats and the dogs. the representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing.<br /><br />the story, after the boring beginning, is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be. there are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. the journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring, not to mention two very strange british swans.<br /><br />with disney, you always get a strong meaningful message. with the jungle book it is where you belong, with beauty and the beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. however with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing. the film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant.<br /><br />my sister and i found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the jungle book cast.<br /><br />despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message, this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to.
