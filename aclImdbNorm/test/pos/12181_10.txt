i quite this anne rice book adaption. while most of the film is filmed here in australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in. lestat (stuart townsend) has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band. when he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires, understadebly, go mad and plot his death. meanwhile jesse (marguerite moreau) a orphaned member of the supernatural studies, who has an ancient vampire family tree, has become deeply obsessed with lestat. her boss david (paul mcgann) understands her obsession and revaeals his obsession with the vampire marius, (vincent perez)who is an ancient vampire and the man who made lestat a vampire too. jesse is given lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the queen of the damned- akasha (aaliyah). when lestat holds a concert in death valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there akasha may come as well. meanwhile akasha has other plans. she goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. with lestat tempted with royality and loving care by akasha the ancient vampires consisting of marius and jesses aunt maharet (lena olin) plot against them. join her or die?<br /><br />i thought the film was fantastic, it had great fight scenes, great music and great locations. aaliyah sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere, but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets.<br /><br />i gave this film 10/10 because it was a fantastic film and i urge you to see it!
