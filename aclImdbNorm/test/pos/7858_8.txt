clint eastwood plays a wounded union soldier found by a girl from a confederate boarding school and he's taken in and nursed back to health instead of turned over to confederate soldiers. seems that the women-folk at this place have ulterior motives. geraldine paige, the headmistress, justifies not turning him into the confederacy and even passes him off as her cousin. of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the lady's man and is pretty much making the rounds, but when he gets busted he really gets busted, in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off, but it's for his own good, of course, not out of retribution. things get carried a bit further though when certain women don't get what they want. i haven't seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by today's standards is still pretty strange. not typical eastwood at all. if you haven't seen this one it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
