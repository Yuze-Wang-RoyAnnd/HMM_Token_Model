i have watched two episodes so far, i really like it. even though i am no longer in college, it makes me miss the wonderful college life. i wish that i spent a little more time socializing. i kind of identify myself with rusty. when i was rushing a fraternity, my big brother was not like cappie at all, i wish that i had a big brother like him. so if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters, then it is a pretty good show.<br /><br />it is more realistic than american pie with less explicit sex jokes. can we also call this a younger version of "desperate wives?" some of the writers must be greeks themselves, the story seems to reflect somewhat of the real fraternity and sorority life. it was shot in high definition. and they actually filmed outside instead of inside of studios. so the picture quality is very good. they could easily make this a good film. unlike a movie which can only last a few hours, i can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it free on tv weekly.<br /><br />the casting is excellent, the actors are about the right age, and they are new and fresh, so that makes them more real. this show practically is about everyone. there are asian and black frat boys and sorority girls in the show as well. it is almost a little shocking that they had a little story about two guys in the fraternity had sex in first episode, then tried to hook up again in the second episode. i don't think that i have seen anything like this on tv before. this show somehow reminded me about a warner bro's tv show of teenagers called "young americans" which got canceled in early 2001. in that show, a girl who dressed like a man kissed a guy, and that guy thought that she was a male homosexual.<br /><br />greek life can be fun, but on the same time, students have to study for exams, etc; by the time when people actually have some free time in their lives, there is no fraternity of sorority for them to join any more. i don't know how long this show will last, sooner or later, those people will have to "graduate" college, too. maybe they will find some new actors for another 4 years of fun college life!
