the story takes place in rural germany on the eve of the second world war, a unique setting, with a couple of british agents being held by the germans in a farm house. since they aren't technically at war yet, it seems as if both sides must have realized what was coming. both agents (bruce lester and ray milland) escape into the countryside and split up. milland happens upon gypsy woman marlene dietrich one evening as she's alone at her camp preparing dinner. their encounter is an amazing and captivating scene, not so much for milland but for dietrich, who takes sexy sultriness to a whole new plane. milland disguises himself as a gypsy in order to hide from the germans, but he remains committed to his mission, to do with locating the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but who also isn't a committed nazi. the hollywood take on gypsy life and customs is predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the targets for extermination by the nazis adds a certain tension. the film straddles the line between being a serious story about the poison gas and the urgent search to get the formula, and a colorful though not too convincing love story between milland and dietrich. however, they're both very good; it's the fault of the film that didn't give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism, relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes. nonetheless, there are some tense and interesting points here and there, the surprise meetings with german soldiers and gestapo agents, where dietrich does a great palm reading and milland nearly as good faking one, and a dinner party of germans of various stripes at which the announcement comes over the radio that germany had been attacked by poland and everyone stands and does a stiff arm salute. mitchell leison may have missed some opportunities here and there, but he fully took advantage of others.
