toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (c. aubrey smith) who decides to gather his grown children from around the world. davies is working as a chorus girl in new york when she gets the news that "daddy" wants her. hmmmm, sounds familiar. davies' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise so-so comedy as she upsets the staid british countryside with her brazen american personality. not as sharp as some other davies comedies, but still worth a look. ray milland plays her long-lost "brother." doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, and halliwell hobbes are all fun, too.
