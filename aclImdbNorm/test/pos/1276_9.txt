chris nolan's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. a first film is as complex as "memento" or "the prestige", though maybe a little harder to get a handle on. still it smacks of originality and creative drive, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp. few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that nolan has. the story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street, until he follows someone, whose noticed him following others, and has been following him in tern, from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange. more naturalistic and realist than nolan's later work but just as razor sharp.
