this was on showtime the other night, and i figured it was going to be another made-for-video crap fest, like "earth vs. the spider" or any of those other hbo horror shorts. instead, i found a comedy/gore classic. it was legitimately funny, and surprisingly, the acting was quite good. even my wife, an overall horror-hater, agreed and was laughing at parts. in addition, the fx were high-quality.<br /><br />overall, the film felt like a parody of joy ride/jeepers creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from shaun of the dead. definitely worth watching, but don't take it seriously.<br /><br />the end.
