this was chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the results are mixed. the movie is a biting satire of hitler and mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the jews. it was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirm.<br /><br />when compared to chaplin's earlier works, this is quite pale in comparison. the sweet, funny style of his silents, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. there are lots of meaningless bits that drag on. if this was a silent, it probably would not have happened.<br /><br />i find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance. one of the most touching moments is, obviously, the speech at the end.<br /><br />the great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both chaplin's history and movie history. it is flawed, but chaplin is in great form.
