there are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making.<br /><br />"bronenosets potyomkin" is one of these movies, and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema. <br /><br />grigori aleksandrov & sergei m. eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a russian battleship. when the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace the them, and support them. things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business. what follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. anyone who has seen "the untouchables", and "bronenosets potyomkin" knows exactly what i mean.<br /><br />overall i think this movie raised the bar for film making just as "intolerance" did a few years earlier. if you do not mind silent films, do yourself a favor, and see "bronenosets potyomkin". <br /><br />if you don't like silent films..... watch "bronenosets potyomkin" anyway. <br /><br />
