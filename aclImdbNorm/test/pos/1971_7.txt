david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing. "existenz" is classic cronenberg. briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. the game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game. jennifer jason leigh plays the game's developer, guiding a novitiate marketeer, jude law, through the game's paces. while in the game they uncover strange goings-on and possible crimes. but are they real, or is it the game? not even the game's author knows. <br /><br />the movie is quite a treat, keeping the viewer engaged, but in the dark until the final minutes. another thing i like about "existenz" is that it doesn't use a heavy reliance on special effects, it's the story itself that propels the movie. recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for.
