bart the genius whilst not the first simpsons episode, bart he genius more or less is the first typical episode. there's no gimmickry or theme it's just your typical simpsons episode in set-up. it always seems to me that it's an episode that grows on you. there are certain elements i don't care for, largely the blotchy animation which can be forgiven. but over time i take a liking to this story of it's uniqueness.<br /><br />for example, it'd be very hard for a live-action sit-com on a standard budget to do this episode due to the various different sets that show in this episode, the computer bays in ms. melon's class, the opera and so on. my point is with that, the simpsons realises one of the biggest strengths in animation. the sheer lack of visual limitations when compared to live-action.<br /><br />on a writing stand-point it's also highly intelligent and fresh. the concept is pretty unique, and particularly the problems faced. instead of the ol' fail-safe that work was too hard, it was simply bart's social isolation from his classmates that failed him (although the exploding science experiment may prove otherwise...which i also think is one of the best visual gags of the series.) the ending seems a little unoriginal, largely because the bart running naked into his room to avoid homer was already done in the shorts, but still funny for marge and lisa's short back-and-forth if for nothing else.<br /><br />ultimately it's a very good episode, with lots of interesting new point in the series, though not exactly perfect.<br /><br />oh, and the now iconic name kwijybo was of course unleashed onto the world.
