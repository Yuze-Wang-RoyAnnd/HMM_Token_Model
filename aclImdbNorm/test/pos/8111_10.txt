the great dictator is a beyond-excellent film. charlie chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism. the anti-nazi speech by chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments. throughout this movie, i sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.
