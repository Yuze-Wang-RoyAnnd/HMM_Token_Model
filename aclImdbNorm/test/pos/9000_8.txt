i just watched it last night and it was great.i can see why some ppl have ill feelings towards it from a rugby fan and maori culture point of view but other than that i have no idea what's so negative about it. the movie is great. it has a lot of heart. very inspiring and encouraging to all ages. great family movie! they did a pretty good job considering that it was a budget movie. i love movies based on true stories/events. i was raised around rugby all my life, it is a great game but i was never really taken to it because (please forgive me if i offend anyone, nothing personal this is just how i saw it) i thought, their trainings are not as ruthless or hard, the players are not as disciplined and don't seemed as serious like other sportmen and it looked like it's all just muscle and blooming tackling each other etc. but after watching forever strong, i was like, wow! i was proud! it did good things for rugby (well it changed my view of rugby) and also the new zealnd haka. i actually cried. i am not even new zealander and i was proud of their culture. didn't even know what the chant meant until this movie. the movie is not about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not even about new zealand all blacks or the haka or etc......mother of pearls!!!!! hahaha shux!<br /><br />so to all you beautiful negative ppl, you are missing the point! i am sure if they had the means, it would have been better, the haka is in there because that was part of highland rugby culture, tradition or what ever you want to call it. <br /><br />so any new members on this site such as myself, please don't be put off by those negative comments. see it for yourself! must see movie! there is a lot you can learn from this movie, ppl of all ages. it definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble! this movie reminded me of a lot of things that i already know and was raised with but i kinda lost along the way! loved it! happy reading ppls and all the best!<br /><br />muawha!
