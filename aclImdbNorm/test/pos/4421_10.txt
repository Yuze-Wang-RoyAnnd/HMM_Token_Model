ok, so i loved rachael ray before, but now, i adore her! how innovative. i love that she has a cooking section- i admit that occasionally i skip that part, only because it makes me waaay too hungry! but i also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. i love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. i love how personable she is and how creative she is. i also like how she does her mystery guests. she just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts. she still gets a little starstruck occasionally and i love that. i love that she talks about her personal life on there and reminds people how happy she is. she's even mentioned tabloids before and it's so funny! she also has the funniest stories! anyway, i'm a fan for life. even my 2 year old knows who rachael ray is and he loves her too!
