i couldn't believe that the adult swim guys came up with this character. i laughed for days just thinking about this show. having finally seen the pilot i guess i will stick around for a few more episodes. assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. assy drinks too much and "plays by his own rules" as you might have guessed. the only other funny moments are assy shooting many,many people and spending time at home - in the bathroom. it is not squidbillies funny, but it is worth a look.
