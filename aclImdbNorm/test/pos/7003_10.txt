as a zombie fan, i really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! pb is also an excellent tie-in to chronicles of riddick (cor). the gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness. there are so many metaphors in the story! riddick is this bad guy, but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks. the muslim guy, imam, relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers, but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. overall, i recommend this film to any sci-fi fans. you won't be disappointed.
