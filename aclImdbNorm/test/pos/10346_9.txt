a touching movie about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that structurally underestimate her. the issues are subtly addressed and timeless, as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in dutch society today. this movie is a tribute to all modern women without dwelling on feminism. not only the story is well told, the acting and the scenery are great as well.
