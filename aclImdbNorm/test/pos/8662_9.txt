the bothersome man is one of the best foreign films i have ever seen. all the technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, acting, directing, pacing, etc). the story is breathtaking.<br /><br />seemingly beyond death, our main character finds himself inhabiting a world without beauty, passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses. his work is cold and uninteresting; his relationships are numb and uninspiring, and when it all becomes too much, he seeks to end it in front of a train. but it doesn't end - he can not leave this strange world by suicide! working his way back to a man who seemed to be feeling he same isolation and loneliness, our main character joins him in excavating a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music. just as they break through - and i will not reveal that much, it all comes to an end and the movie ends as oddly as it began.<br /><br />suffice it to say you will either love this movie or hate it. i feel that it is like a magical poem - open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next. if you enjoy new experiences in film and want to be taken away from hollywood's crap-feast, try this movie!<br /><br />9/10 (and i don't rate easily!) because in spite of its darkness, this movie left me with a sense of something greater...something mysterious and beyond ourselves. well done!
