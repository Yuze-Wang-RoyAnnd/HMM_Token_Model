alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's. never attempts to be an "event". just wants to entertain. and it does. i was surprised by kiefer sutherland. in a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. the plot does make allusions to alice in wonderland. a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and kiefer does fall down one. like alice the plot does twist and turn, but with a freshness you don't see in small movies. i loved the direction, sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie.
