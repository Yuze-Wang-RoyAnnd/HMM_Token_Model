it would appear that some previous reviewers may have had their expectations set a bit too high going into this film. i found it scanning the satellite channels for something (not knowing what) and happened upon it. i thought by the title it might be one of the myriad soft-core porn flicks appearing regularly on the movie channels but i was pleasantly surprised. although there was some male frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft-core title -- go figure!), this was not the focus of the film. it was just fun.<br /><br />don't be deceived by my tastes: my recent screenings have included before night falls and europa, europa (both geat, imho). but i also enjoy total mental shutdown when watching a movie. virtual sexuality did this for me and that's not a bad thing!
