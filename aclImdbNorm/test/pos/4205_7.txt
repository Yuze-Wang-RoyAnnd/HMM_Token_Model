the early films of the dead end kids (before they were re-christened "the bowery boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced films from warner brothers. despite their being rather formulaic, they still had excellent writing, acting and hold up well over time. do not confuse these with the cheap bowery boys films from monogram pictures--despite the presence of huntz hall and leo gorcey, these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to quality.<br /><br />the film begins with tough-guy john garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship. unfortunately, shortly after this he's on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didn't commit. the problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man, so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo. eventually, he meets up with feisty may robson and the dead end kids--as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time.<br /><br />where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising, but because of the quality of the film, it doesn't seem to matter. garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the pickiest of viewers.
