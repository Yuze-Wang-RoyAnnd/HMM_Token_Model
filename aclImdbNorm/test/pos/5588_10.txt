this may not be regarded as a review on any film, but just a comment on a film i saw when i was a youngster. i remember coming home of an evening all full of wonder at what i had seen. i tried to retell my parents part of the story but they listened without understanding well what was so strange about two kids stranded on an island who fall in love and grow together and have a son. as you must have guessed by now i'm referring to the blue lagoon (1949) which has kept me bewitched and bewildered through the years (almost 50) and now wonder full of anxiety and disgust who or what has prevented the film from being available in cassette or dvd or whatever. i've spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows anything about it. what a waste indeed! sorry if my english is not at all technical or scientific, but my mother tongue is spanish. i'm doing my best to make myself understood. thank you, my name is juan and i'm writing from uruguay in s.america.
