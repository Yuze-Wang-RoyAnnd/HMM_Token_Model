although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.<br /><br />the scenes in bath are just how they should be. although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, i like the scene where they are in the hot baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. the ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. i especially liked catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.<br /><br />northanger abbey looked suitably imposing, but i enjoyed the bath scenes better.<br /><br />schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland. googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel.<br /><br />ugh peter firth as mr tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.<br /><br />general tilney is played reasonably well by hardy, and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella. ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney. as for john thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but i quite like it.<br /><br />i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. the marchioness! i hate her. she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.<br /><br />some of the script is peculiar. when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks "i suppose you saw the body? how did it appear?" what a silly thing to say! elinor's calm response is stupid too.<br /><br />anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
