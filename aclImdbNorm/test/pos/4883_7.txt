ok, why complain about this movie? it's fiction. deal with it. if you want to see the biography, go watch it. this is an original, fictionalized version of what happened in wisconsin. people who are obsessed will complain about this, as they do every other deviation of the facts. sad but true. i think making kane hodder the man in which the film is named after was a great idea. i thought it wasn't so good at first, i'll be honest. but that just made it even scarier. if you like kane hodder, ed gein or movies based on real events, i think this is a good movie. but if you're obsessed (like some other people) stay away from this movie and all others.
