...and there were quite a few of these. <br /><br />i do not like this cartoon as much as many others, partly because it was made in its period. i much prefer cartoons with daffy and bugs which are fifteen or so years before-hand. many people will like this, particularly people who always find violence funny, cartoon or not.<br /><br />the basic plot is a pretty well known one for looney tunes: elmer goes out hunting, daffy leads him to bugs and daffy ends up being shot instead. also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes (some do not enhance the episode), ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre. the plot is mainly geared by jokes - each joke keeps the episode going. this way of plot-going is not all that unusual in looney tunes (of course if you are pretty much a looney tunes boffin - or an eager one - like me, then you'll know this already).<br /><br />for people who love everything about looney tunes and daffy duck and like the sound of what i have said about it, enjoy "rabbit seasoning"!<br /><br />7 and a half out of ten.
