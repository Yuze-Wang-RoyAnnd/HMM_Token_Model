i loved this movie from beginning to end.i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love(skateboarding,drawing) but my friends were always there for me.music was like my rehab,life support,and my drug.it changed my life.i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say.this movie left me speechless to be honest.i just saw it on the ifc channel.i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite.the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie.im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don't do a very good job on translating lines.i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess.i almost never got to see this amazing movie.good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed..well earlier than usual.lol.i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did.i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film.i give it three thumbs way up!<br /><br />this movie blew me away!
