okay, i'll admit right up front that the inki cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market. seen today, the huge-lipped and very stereotypical inki is not politically correct. however, the cartoons were well-made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue (such as the one with leonard maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd). in other words, throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history. plus, inki, little black sambo and other racist cartoons are out there--especially on the internet.<br /><br />this inki cartoon has our little hero out hunting. at first, he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion--a lion that is more than happy to make inki his dinner. however, through all this, a weird minah appears again and again...and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story.<br /><br />cute, well made and clever. i like the inki cartoons. plus, i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks. loads of fun, folks!
