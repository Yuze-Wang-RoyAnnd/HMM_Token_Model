i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the t.v. and came across this film. i don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. what a fun and interesting one to watch. well, my meeting was pushed back, because i couldn't get out of this film. it had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. well, there was a lot of realism in it. the acting was good for a 1954 film. subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next. that is why i ended up watching it. i don't know why they don't show it more often. i would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary. for history buffs, people who like period films, and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one. "the egyptian" has a variety of flavors dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since it's time. what does that say about us? those that don't like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story....are not into film.<br /><br />i haven't had the time to rent it if it is available, but if i get a chance to see it again, i would probably vote it a 10.
