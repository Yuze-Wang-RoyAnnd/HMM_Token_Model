until i saw this film, "life is beautiful" was my favourite film of all time. this film is everything a great film should be. great script, unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands. this film contains the taste that could not come from hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from france. a wonderful movie even above the calibre i have come to expect when i see the handmade films logo come up. i need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet.
