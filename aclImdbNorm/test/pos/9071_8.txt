very suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students flatlining themselves and then being resuscitated to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond. joel schumacher directs with some skill - creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones. the visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go - thanks to screenwriter peter filardi who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story. while the creativity of the story is impressive, the story has many holes as well, particularly in the logic department and believability factors. notwithstanding all of that flatliners is a good effective film because of the script, the direction which again is very surreal at times, and the acting which brings four very talented actors and william baldwin together. this core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely. keifer sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group - the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again. he also manages to portray a man- a young man - with a damaging, destructive secret from his past. kevin bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. oliver platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears. platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well. yes, julia roberts is here too and very good. the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends. i was duly impressed with much of flatliners but more than anything else the story affected me the most. the scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the "flashback" scenes.
