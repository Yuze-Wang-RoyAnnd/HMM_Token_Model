forget samara/sadako and jason...<br /><br />horror has a new name : granny. the plot is simple but efficient. the actors are good (two thumbs up for "michelle" and the killer) and the dialogs are even quite clever. from the beginning to the end, the action will leave you breathless, you just can't escape it... there is blood, awful murders, funny moments, and a sense of perversity that goes far beyond any rule. "deja vu" ? surely not : "granny" is not another slash movie, it's truly a classic of its own... it deserves the success it had and there's even more success to come with its re-release. congrats!
