fado is a sad almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie. as explained by one of the main characters (igor) it also means fate.<br /><br />indeed it's fate that bring the two main characters paco and alex together and triggers the problems that ensue.<br /><br />on the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit. it starts out as an 'on the down and outs' drama/road movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller / road movie.<br /><br />there were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating (i gave it an 8). the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away. she was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger? her explanation was unconvincing. also how did they get through the gate, where were the cops?
