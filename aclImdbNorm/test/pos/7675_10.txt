the many comments made by others have been very informative and i join in their calls for the release of porgy and bess, the 1959 film.<br /><br />in my early teens i joined a record club and this album was one of the free ones i chose for joining. i knew some of the voices were dubbed, but only robert mcferrin was acknowledged on the album. recently my daughter purchased a cd from austria, i think. the quality is excellent, so i am confused about why it is available in europe by cbs records, inc, when i have had no luck in local stores.<br /><br />actually, i never saw the movie but for years have pleaded with local video stores to get it. now i know why it has never been available.<br /><br />i add my voice to others who plead with the heirs of the property and rights and that they agree to release it, however imperfect they perceive it to be - the beauty of the music and story reached so many of us who would never have had the experience otherwise.<br /><br />trudy
