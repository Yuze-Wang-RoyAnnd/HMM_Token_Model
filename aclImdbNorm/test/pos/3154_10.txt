in 1858 tolstoy wrote this in his diary: "the political is not compatible with the artistic, because the former, in order to prove, has to be one-sided." this thought from a great mind is applicable to usa the movie. the film might be read by those with a narrow focus as a 90 minute slam of bush, cheney et. al. as well as a ripping of america as an out-of-control imperialistic force that will ultimately be destroyed by its own folly and thirst for power. the more open-minded viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this dvd a testament to postmodernist thought, as the main character breaks up into bits and pieces surrounded by recurring visuals of the natural world contrasted with the man-made constructions; towers, roads, video monitors, radio, vehicles. above all the ominous threat of wars that have been and are to come smolder throughout. war and rumors of war are what is created, destroyed and recreated on the screen, in our conscious world and in our unconscious minds.
