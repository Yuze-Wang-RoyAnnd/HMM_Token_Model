what an original piece of work. i've always enjoyed liev schreiber the "actor", but now one must appreciate the man on a multi-dimensional level . how did he get that field of sunflowers? was it computerize, it sure looked real. and how do you audition a dog knowing you are going to get that kind of performance? does the academy have a category for animals? i guess what i'm saying is that i really, really enjoyed this quirky, offbeat, little indie film. from the excellent cast (one would never know eugene hutz was not a pro actor) to the cinematographer (some beautiful shots) the music (bought the cd when exiting the theater) and of course the two "d's" (direction and the dog). all in all a "10".<br /><br />/
