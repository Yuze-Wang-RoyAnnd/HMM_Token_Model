i first saw this on demand. or on tv. i'm not really sure. but this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever! i mean, this movie has blood, gore, laughs and chills through out the movie. i recently ordered "monster man" from amazon and i've been watching "monster man" ever since i got it. trust me, you will love this movie. <br /><br />p.s. the commentary on the dvd is way funny. they also said something about "monster man 2" during the commentary. let's hope they make "monster man 2"! if you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. you will absolutely love it! this is the best movie that has come out in 2003.<br /><br />10/10
