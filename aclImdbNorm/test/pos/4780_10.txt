this was the first mickey mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. in the cartoon, mickey does not yet wear gloves. he does not yet speak either. all he does is whistle and play music. the song that he plays is "turkey in the straw" using several farm animals as musical instruments. for example, he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls nursing piglets like an accordion keyboard. i taped this cartoon off of the disney channel and i think it is wonderful. it was based on a silent film starring buster keaton entitled "steamboat bill, jr."
