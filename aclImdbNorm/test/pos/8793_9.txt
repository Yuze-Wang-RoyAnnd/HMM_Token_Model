well, i should say, "the only film related to club/dj/electronic music and raves...that ravers respect".<br /><br />seriously now. it's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver. albeit, its in a club, its in wales and its somewhat dated. the film leaves out some of the sketchier elements of club life, but doesn't disassociate from them altogether. it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.<br /><br />at the core of the film, and the best element of justin kerrigan's script, is the characters, eccentric, unique yet completely understandable and accessible. this film simple would not work and be infinitely less entertaining were it not for jip, koop, nina, moff and lulu. viewers can deny the political and social implications of the subtext of human traffic as a drug film, trainspotting wannabe, important peg in british youth culture circa 90's, but....they can't deny that these are engaging characters.<br /><br />it's frantic, its brutally honest, it's sobering, it's over the top, but its a great comedy. <br /><br />raves are a complex thing, so are the drugs that are taken at these events, so are the people you will encounter. but from someone who has gone to parties, become jaded and still goes...human traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken of the subculture. just whatever you do, avoid "groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic.
