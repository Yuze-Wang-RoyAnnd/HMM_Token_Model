the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are. you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others. you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once. you see humanity at its best and at it's worst. you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself. to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. i implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart. that there is only one true thing and that is... love.
