this is definitely a "must see" film. the excellent director alain chabat (also acting as ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of the "adventures of ast'erix" (the french comic books it's based upon) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. this movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. the only drawback is that a non-french audience (or at least a non-french speaking audience) might not get all the "private jokes". there are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life, that the fun might be lessened. however, it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. all actors are great, but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze, g'erard darmon and edouard baer. and please don't ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books : "ast'erix et ob'elix contre c'esar" and directed by claude zidi.
