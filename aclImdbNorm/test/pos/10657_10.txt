the battleship potemkin is now the oldest film i've seen and it is also the first silent film i've seen. i heard a lot of good things about this movie so i got the tape out at home and i watched it. when it ended i just thought that this was a classic masterpiece. the story is based on the real-life russian battleship potemkin. you wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting. sad being that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it.<br /><br />today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and russian films ever made. i think that everyone should see it (if they can find it.) you will be presently surprised at how good it is. it's a must see classic. 5/5.
