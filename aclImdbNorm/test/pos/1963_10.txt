i just saw this movie for the second time. i first saw it back in the mid-90's as a vanguard video selection. it has retained it power.<br /><br />it is interesting from several aspects. one is that it is based on a true story. two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: keanu reeves and crispin glover. and three, it has dennis hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.<br /><br />the movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. you have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc. the story does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each setting.<br /><br />i wish i could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie. i saw a short bit that indicated it occurred in california and that several schoolmates were taken to view the corpse. <br /><br />this is a good choice for a rainy night video rental. be prepared to feel unsettled at the end.
