i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen. i know that on this website it's received only negative reviews, but for once i'd like to be the good person who gives the worlds best movie a good review. i find the movie to be extremely funny, and it has the perfect mix of everything. it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when i watch it, and i can't get enough of it. the soundtracks brilliant. i love it, i understand why people may not love it as much as i do, but i don't understand how people could hate it. the movie is 100% brilliance. blurred is amazing. i never realised that aussie movies could be so good, and i also never realised i could watch one movie, so many times in a single day without getting sick of it. i think that everybody should watch it, whether its to get a feel of what life was like in the younger days, or if its to see what your in for when you reach the end of year 12.
