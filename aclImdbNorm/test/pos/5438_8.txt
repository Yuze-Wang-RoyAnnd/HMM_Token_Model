this film was really different from what i had imagined but exceeded my expectations nevertheless. this film has the exactly right mixture of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). without being patronizing or wisenheimer it reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist democratic high technology society. it makes you laugh instantly and remain in thought afterwards. for those of you who liked "wag the dog" and wished to have humane and manlike politicians this film should definitely be the choice!<br /><br />"politicians are a lot like diapers: they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons."
