running out of time rests somewhere in the middle of johnny to's cannon, in the "solid good" category. as a crime thriller it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it. it's a johnny to film after all, it has to.<br /><br />andy lau has 72 hours to live. he decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a hostage negotiator of the hk police, played by lau ching wan. that's the plot in a nutshell. on top of that to piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout. it occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it. however, just as johnny to is about to hand over a slick and well-made crime flick (which, let's face it, are dime-a-dozen), he slips in bits and pieces that bring running out of time alive as a full emotional experience, providing the soul and heart to the well-oiled skeleton.<br /><br />the concepts of synchronism and minimalism (staples in his work) are explored in great effect here. always subtle, letting the images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots, exemplary cutting to the score, it's all here. a small love story in a bus between andy lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the "heart" i'm talking about. so simple yet so powerful. ditto for lau's and lau ching wan's car scenes and the bowling-room showdown.<br /><br />however something stops me from claiming running out of time is a masterpiece. to has all the ability and craftmanship down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times. when he's good, he's real good. there are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just too good for their own sake, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie. i'm convinced that if he puts his heart to it, he can make a really great film. as it is, this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. underneath the slick hk style, it's the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film. worth watching, definitely.
