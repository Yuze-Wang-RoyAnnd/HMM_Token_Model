it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :d i love it because logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked dean too, but logan is best. i would like lorelai to remain with christopher, because he is beautiful. this show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen. i really want the dvd's but i think that here in romania will never appear, because i think that they don't even know that they have fans here. but, no matter what, i'll be watching it. bye!!
