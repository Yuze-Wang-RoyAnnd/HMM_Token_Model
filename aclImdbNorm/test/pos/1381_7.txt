the '7' rating is not necessarily a smear-- this movie was done on a low budget-- but done well within its limits.<br /><br />a usual pot-boiler plot-- ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and prisoner escape in pods, land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up. mayhem ensues, a lot of ammo is expended.<br /><br />the special effects were spare and properly done, emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky, cheap looking plastic props. plus the pacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart.<br /><br />i peg this one as a lite saturday afternoon flick. you can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and it'll still be enjoyable. even better, your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment-- and she'll be happy: after all, she got to talk to you! it's that type of movie.<br /><br />anyways, the actual story line has s few holes in after they hit the planet, but hey, this is a guns 'n' ammo action movie. cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have beer and chips at hand. so don't get get yourself into a brain-cramp over the ending.
