i found the movie judas kiss excellent. carla gugino's performance was extraordinaire, probably her best in her career. her facial expressions in many scenes, were unbelievably true to character, and they were exploited to its best by director gutierrez. all actors and actresses were very good in their performances. emma thompsom was, as usual, marvelous. her acting capabilities are way above what would be required for this character, so she actually enhances it in the movie.<br /><br />the story, although sometimes over-intricate, is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end. very, very good. a movie not to be missed. a story well weaved and brilliantly directed. quality of film, excellent.
