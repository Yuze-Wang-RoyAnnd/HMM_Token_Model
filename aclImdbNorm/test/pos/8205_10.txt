this movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office. my warning is ,do not reveal too much about yourself, 2 be careful who you cross!! ,there are spies on this internet thing. i thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor angela bennett, i did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse angela i thought did a sterling job of outwitting jack delvin and that awful girl my question is, why does that computer make that noise when it works? like a clicking sound mine does not do this or this one. this film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet also why couldn't angela do the virus destroyer programme at a cybercafe? i also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to disk was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your floppy disk the bar only moved slowly!!! i quite liked angela's house at the beginning of the film as well why did no one believe angela???
