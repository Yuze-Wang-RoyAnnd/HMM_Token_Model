like most other reviewers, i really enjoyed this tv miniseries. i didn't see it when it first came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war films - happened to record it in 1989. i remember watching it at my grandparents' cabin one night and i was completely drawn into the story! it has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance, and espionage. i've seen lots of films that are set during wwii, but none with a twist like this! thankfully, i was able to make a vhs copy of the film several years ago. i've watched it several times since then and i still enjoy it. i would love for this film to be released on dvd. it would be so much easier to view with chapters.
