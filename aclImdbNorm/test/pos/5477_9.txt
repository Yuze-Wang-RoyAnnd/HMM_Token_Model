this is one of the few movies of this type i have reviewed, and enjoyed. while clint eastwood is his usual self, the overall story works well, even in the limits of washington d.c.<br /><br />the theme: an assassin is tracking the president, and there is only one person who may save him.<br /><br />it cannot be easy to make a film which audiences enjoy these days, involving this arena. this film succeeds on several levels. eastwood is his usual underplayed hero, wanting to save the president since the kennedy era. he does well in this role, as does his foil, reneee russo ( an fbi agent) overall well-done and suspenseful with extra stars for malkovich. 9/10.
