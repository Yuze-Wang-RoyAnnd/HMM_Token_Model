i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot. frankly, i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie. i was wrong. the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walker's beautiful wailing voice. the film explores the identity crisis of pierre (guillaume depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and his consequential (self-)destruction. the story is divided into two parts
