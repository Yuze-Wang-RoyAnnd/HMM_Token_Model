this film was not great cinema, but definitely a good film to see with your family, especially children from 10-15. there are good topics of discussion brought up in this movie, such as bullies, the environment, and working to make things right. jimmy buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful... the young actors were excellent, and this is a movie i would expect to see on the family channel or the hallmark channel. except for a few words in the dialog, a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the classroom. hopefully it will be shown in drive-ins this summer so that more people get to see it. it did follow carl hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance.
