my ex wife and i saw and were intrigued by the trailer for this film. we waited for it to come out but when it did it didn't stay in theaters very long. several years later i bought it on vhs and i am transferring it to dvd so i can preserve it.<br /><br />i found it to be very moving. it is about real events in a real country. burma got such a bad reputation for the political oppression it created that they changed their name.<br /><br />i find women with little make-up on to be very sexy. patricia arquette is in this movie. frances mcdormand and spalding gray are in it only briefly.<br /><br />after coming home to find her young son and husband brutally murdered laura (arquette) is afraid of blood. a bad trait for a doctor. her sister (mcdormand) talks her into going on a vacation to burma. while there she witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has her passport stolen. in a bold (or stupid) move she asks a tourist guide to show her something off the tourist track. her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get him and herself to safety.<br /><br />every time i watch this it reminds me that we in the united states forget that to a peasant living under military rule, socialism, where at least eating is virtually guaranteed, looks pretty darn good.
