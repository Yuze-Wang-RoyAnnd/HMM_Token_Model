renee zellweger absolutely shines as nurse betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.<br /><br />when soap opera obsessed waitress betty sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (morgan freeman and chris rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on a reason to love are real. she decides to travel to los angeles to find famed heart specialist dr. david ravell (a character on the show).<br /><br />as the two oddly paired hitmen, the caustic rock and the pontificating freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and greg kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. renee zellweger turns in an innocent, candy-coated, and sometimes terribly sweet performance as nurse betty. she exudes goodness, warmth, and is irresistible. while the script sometimes feels like a sit-com, is filled with sometimes unbelievable characters and contrived situations, zellweger is so likeable and so utterly disarming that it all comes together.<br /><br />with just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting, a winning performance from zellweger, a great supporting cast and a competent script, nurse betty is utterly delightful.<br /><br />7 out of 10
