when i first saw this film on video in a department store... it intrigued me. considering the fact that i thought i was in love and i was the same age as the youths in this film at the time (although i realize they are now old enough to be my parents), plus the soundtrack being written by elton john & bernie taupin just before they "made it big" here in north america... i figured i had nothing to lose in buying it. i was not disappointed.<br /><br />so far, i have shown it to many guys i have dated since, and to my current boyfriend... obviously, they didn't find it as lovely as i do... preferring to call it a "chick" movie... but i still laugh and cry. this film was vastly overlooked. it's good to see it's available to rent at one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic. <br /><br />so maybe it's a bit far fetched... but it gives you a lighthearted sense of innocence... and a renewed faith in love.
