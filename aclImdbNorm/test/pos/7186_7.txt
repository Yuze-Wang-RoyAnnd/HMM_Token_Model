the french people are not known to be great movie producers.<br /><br />though their amelie scores high points at the oscars. asterix et obelix is a very different film of what i am used to from the french. it is a great movie especially for kids. the only thing that boddert me was that it was spoken in french and subtiteld. normally with the english spoken movies (here in the netherlands) i don't have to read the subtitles. but with the french language you just have to read to understand. the story it self is just great with obelix who doesn't recall him self of be"ing fat, but there also nice details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. you all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows all most slide by slide the book. every thing is in it, from the sfinx nose braking till pirate red beards lose of three more ships. i would say a great movie for the weekend with the children.
