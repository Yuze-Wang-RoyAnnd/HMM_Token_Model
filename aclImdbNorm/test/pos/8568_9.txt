i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive-in theatre here in toronto. it's about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other sororities at their college, so they start up their own, and of course call it h.o.t.s. it's a fun movie, that is just bursting with drive-in nostalgia! lots of fully endowed t-shirts, vans, fighting, and a football game showdown like no other! it's been compared to "animal house", which is a good movie in it's own right, but to me nothing compares to h.o.t.s. it has it's own brand of fun & character. if you are looking for a classic t n'a movie, look no further because the h.o.t.s. girls are to the rescue, boom-boom shorts & all!
