but not too hip. and not too wisecracking. "judas kiss" nails the new noir thing just right. great pacing and a nuanced score round out a twisty tale filled with sex, betrayal and sure-fire one liners. inspiring work all around. kudos in partcular to halholbrook (his best work ever), gil bellows (ally mc-what?) and carla gugino (the best famme fatale in ages... smart, funny and ultra hot)... i give this a 9 (out of 10) and that's because 10 should be reserved for like, humphrey bogart and coen bros movies.
