as most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'after the funeral' is very good indeed. always one of my favourite poirot stories i was worried that it might be 'messed about with'. well, it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining. david suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other star of this show is monica dolan who surely could not be bettered as miss gilchrist. i also really enjoyed fiona glasscott who was spot on as the cutting rosamund shane but really, the casting was quite impeccable throughout! <br /><br />one point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes. the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn't mind how they tightened up the structure of the abernethie family (in the book the family tree is really quite complicated). the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end, when they all leave enderby, quite touching. this is really one of the very best of the poirot series so far.
