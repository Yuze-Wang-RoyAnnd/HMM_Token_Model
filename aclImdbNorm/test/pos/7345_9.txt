this film tackles the subjects of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, artful, sensitive, and visually stunning way that i was completely transported. it is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women. you'll have to see for yourself. dreya weber (jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality, in a way that every woman will relate to. i found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging. there was nothing in this film that said to me "low budget" as far as quality is concerned. nothing. the fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the film's creators. the final sequence during the credits will also knock your socks off. it is a brilliant celebration of jane's choice. unexpected and inspiring.
