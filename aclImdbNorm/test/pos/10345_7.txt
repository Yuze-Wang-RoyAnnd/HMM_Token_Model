nynke is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the oscar winning film character (1997). but this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting...<br /><br />sure, nynke is a beautiful historic & costume drama (with fantastic acting by monic hendrickx!) in which you witness the personal growth of 'nynke van hichtum' in her marriage to pieter jelles troelstra. the subtitle of this movie is 'a lovestory'. so it starts, and ends with their marriage. <br /><br />but that is where the director makes a crucial mistake! nynke's exciting, independent life started when the marriage ended. she wrote several children's books and travelled around the world. what a great life she has lived. but pieter verhoeff puts nynke back in the trammels of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of: the thought that her life extended just her marriage to troelstra, being no one else but the mother of their kids.<br /><br />let's all hope for nynke ii!
