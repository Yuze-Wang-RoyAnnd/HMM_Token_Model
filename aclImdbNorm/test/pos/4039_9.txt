i really enjoyed this film. i'm not usually one for fairy tales or make believe storeys but this film captured my attention.<br /><br />i first saw this film on the uk channel hallmark...which usually shows afew tacky films...but then snow queen came along...and i was loving it! i really really admire bridget fonda in this movie...she plays the snow queen brilliantly and glamorously.<br /><br />i won't explain what the story is about as other people have already done so, so there is no point repeating.<br /><br />i would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journey...get this film...but if you want to purchase it and you live in the uk, you might have a hard time. i've bought it from south korea brand new (english edition of course).
