this timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. i can't even count how many times i've seen dirty dancing. this is one movie that i could probably watch every few weeks and still love.<br /><br />there is something timeless about this movie. i have loved other "blockbuster love story movies" like pretty woman and when harry met sally. i think their up there but there is something about dirty dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. the characters, the chemistry between swaze and grey, the movie's direction, the incredible dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. it is an instant classic and i've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.<br /><br />i don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. dirty dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. <br /><br />this movie is always on tv and i will continue to watch it as long as they show it. but i will mention i have no interest in seeing "havanna nights", this one they should have left alone.
