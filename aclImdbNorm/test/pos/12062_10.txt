this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching. i was upset to hear that it was canceled, especially because i didn't realize the ratings were so poor. as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers. almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show. now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvd's. how bad was the show doing? does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings? i know that when it went to thursdays, it was more difficult for me to catch. thank g*d for dvr's! <br /><br />anyways, this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more "the war at home". if any other networks see this, please pick up the show!!!! please!
