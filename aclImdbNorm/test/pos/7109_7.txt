this has one of the more unusual plots i've seen in a horror film, but it's based on good, solid universal studios fare: lots of monsters, pretty heroine, torch-bearing villagers. but my favorite part is larry talbot (the wolf man) searching for the cure for his lycanthropy. after dying in the original "wolf man," he is resurrected and wanders through "frankenstein meets the wolf man" and "house of frankenstein" searching for a way to end his affliction. i think first-time viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interesting.<br /><br />
