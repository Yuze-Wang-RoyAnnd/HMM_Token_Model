i loved this movie. you can't buy it, rent it, or find it... but it's a keeper.<br /><br />wonderful chemistry between braccho and walken... and ferrar....<br /><br />terrific non stop action and reactions.... loved it.<br /><br />i've watched my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade... each time showing it to someone who never heard of it.<br /><br />find this movie and watch it. <br /><br />so many films are on tv over and over again - without any of the wit and style of this little film.<br /><br />i didn't know it was made for tv... my copy is an 8 track i pirated years ago... i hope it lasts.
