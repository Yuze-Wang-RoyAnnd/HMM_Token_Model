i just picked this up in a decent if not outstanding dvd version for one dollar at wal mart.<br /><br />run out and buy it.<br /><br />i'm fairly sure that this version is the short, incomplete version released against the animator's wishes in the late fifties, but even so, at a buck it's an *incredible* bargain.<br /><br />this film was syndicated in small chunks as a serial to local tv stations in the early 60s for the kid's shows that almost every station ran on weekday afternoons in those days - "mr bill and bozo", "monty's gang" (channel 4, greenville sc) and "captain grady" (channel 13, asheville nc - which is where i saw it). it made such an impression on twelve-or-so-old me that i immediately recognised it when i spotted it in wal mart tonight and grabbed it.<br /><br />wonderful. you should get it.
