otto preminger's "the man with the golden arm" is a reference to heroin addiction - something that must have been rather risky to film back in 1955, fifty years ago (the censors today still have a problem with drug content in films!).<br /><br />the lead role was originally offered to marlon brando, then snatched by frank sinatra before brando could respond. sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex-heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself battling the demons of temptation.<br /><br />preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "anatomy of a murder" starring james stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama). preminger pretty much helped change the face of cinema back in the '50s - "anatomy of a murder" was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content (references to rape, women's "panties," seduction, etc.) and "the man with the golden arm" deals with a topic that is equally volatile.<br /><br />however, preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative. this is like a forerunner to "the panic in needle park" (1971) and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs to the classic billy wilder movie "lost weekend," starring ray milland. these three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today.
