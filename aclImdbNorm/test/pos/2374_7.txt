the final installment sees sho aikawa and riki takeuchi (looking cooler than ever in his reversible overcoat!) pitched against each other for one last battle, this time in the future. the plot owes a lot to blade runner, but done in takashi miike's low budget, frenetic, comic style. i did feel that it was the weakest of the three doa films, and although the ending was still outrageous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. compared to the likes of ichi the killer and visitor q, doa:final is nowhere near as extreme, but is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy. that said, fans of the first two (and fans of miike) will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.
