a sentimental, heart-tugging family film set in england of the 1920s. a young elizabeth taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the grand national; fortunately, ex-jockey mickey rooney is around to give liz some help. director clarence brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been excessively maudlin in someone else's hands. he and screenwriters helen deutsch and theodore reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. true, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but overall it's quite affecting, and gorgeously filmed in technicolor. the race itself is quite thrilling, and like so many great classics, there's a marvelous, three-hankie fade-out at the end. liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start, and rooney--who i usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good. donald crisp is terrif as liz's gruff father and angela lansbury is a delight as her older, boy-crazy sister. most of the acting kudos, however, belong to anne revere, who won a richly deserved supporting actress oscar playing liz's wise and caring mother.
