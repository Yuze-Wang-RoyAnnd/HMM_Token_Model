this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on. this movie is practically mchale's navy for the 90s or police academy at sea. grammer proves he can play roles other than frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the navy in order to get his own sub. rob schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and lauren holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. ken hudson campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. the movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time i watch it. many of the navy phrases and terms go over my head, though, but it's a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters.
