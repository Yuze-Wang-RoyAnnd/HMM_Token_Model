what a great film! i never knew much about buddy holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. this is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. although i never cared for gary bussey, he was fabulous as buddy holly! i don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. the music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. i don't think i would change a thing in this film, it was all good! what a difference in the stars from the 50's to todays music stars. how can you compare someone like buddy holly to justin timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?
