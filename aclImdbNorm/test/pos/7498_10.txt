for those unfamiliar with paddy chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. while chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine is going today, two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death. beyond that, some insights into chayefsky's view of life in general are 'slipped into' the movie as well. the 20th century may well turn out to be the first and last century of the united states in the history of the world. if it turns out that the contribution to the arts by the united states was in the dimension of the 'movie,' this is a prime example of that art.
