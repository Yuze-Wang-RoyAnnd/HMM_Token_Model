this great film never showed up in my town, so actually i didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when i caught it on german television. i was expecting something of a disaster, and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work. the tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film, so i hope to see it once again on the big screen. what a spectacle that would be! don't miss it, if you ever have the chance. unfortunately the harsh treatment of "heaven's gate" at its opening ruined michael cimino's career and he moved from the passable ("year of the dragon") to the boringly ludicrous ("the sicilian") and the screechingly dumb ("desperate hours").
