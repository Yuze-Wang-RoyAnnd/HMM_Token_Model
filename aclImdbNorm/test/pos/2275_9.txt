i walked into the movie theater, with no expectations for the film i was about to witness, "everything is illuminated". i walked out with a joy i have barely come to feel with american films. the directorial debut of actor, leiv schreiber, the film follows a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group including a brake-dancing barely english-speaking punk from the eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog. the first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely european flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust. this little movie brings out so many emotions, and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination, but also of relationships and connections. the acting is incredibly powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of the cinematography, to die for. with some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes "everything is illuminated" managed to capture my heart.
