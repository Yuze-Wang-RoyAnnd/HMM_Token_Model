the hurried approach that lewis seiler takes with king of the underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. one of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. the audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. this development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. the story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate. by abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation (the mob's personal physician), the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events. the nelsons (kay francis and john eldredge) are forcibly employed by gurney (bogart) without objections. this stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture. the one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me, ironically dealt with the pacing of the story, and that rate at which it was told. i think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. this paradox happens to be a result of personal taste, in that i think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through rigorous character development. however, for the purposes of this film, i must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic flare to the impact of the film.<br /><br />**1/2 (of ****)
