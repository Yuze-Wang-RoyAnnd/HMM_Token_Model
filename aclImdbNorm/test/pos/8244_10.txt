i have to say that i know the documentaries of mister "ornek and so i knew that i will get a very well made piece of movie documentary. i was not disappointed. as a history nerd - i did saw hundreds of documentary and liked the different approach of this work.<br /><br />the director and his 17 consultants (historians, veteran families) tried to access the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of solders from both sides. so, the history is followed by british, australian and turkish soldiers.<br /><br />narrated is this docu by jeremy irons and sam neill - both boost the intensity and emotionality of this documentary by their great voices.<br /><br />i saw this film in a cinema in italy in dolby surround. i did buy the dvd last year and will wait again 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries.<br /><br />summary: well made. intense. history with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators
