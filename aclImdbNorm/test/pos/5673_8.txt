the movie starts out with three people on a play it by ear holiday who decide to first visit a crocodile farm and then go on to a little lighter activity, a "fishing" tour.<br /><br />you pick up some interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to increase the suspense later during the movie as you recall what was told earlier on.<br /><br />the action in the movie is well timed and not over done. suspense is built through the "what ifs", the "unknown", and the sometimes gut wrenching decisions the characters make in the movie.<br /><br />i found myself wondering what i would do if i was in the same boat, no pun intended.<br /><br />the film quality was really good and the effects where realistic, believable and not over the top or cartoon looking and out of place, the way you sometimes get with cgi.<br /><br />as a horror movie buff i watch just about every horror movie i can get my hands on, in just about every genre, and this is one of the best "crocodile" horror movies, if not the best i have seen.<br /><br />watch this movie and you will not be disappointed.
