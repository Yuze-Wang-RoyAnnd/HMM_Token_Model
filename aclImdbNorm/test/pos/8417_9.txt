after a very long time marathi cinema has come with some good movie.this movie is one of the best marathi movies ever made. it shows how a old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye. he tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child's eye. doctor and a relative of his tries to help him in his attempt.<br /><br />the acting by the grandfather, the boy and the doctor are simply superb. they have shown true picture of a typical marathi life. every bit of action has some meaning in it. i would recommend to watch this movie, as initially i thought this one would be of documentary type but this was above my expectations.<br /><br />this film is really going to touch your hearts.i would expect more marathi movies to come up with performances like this.
