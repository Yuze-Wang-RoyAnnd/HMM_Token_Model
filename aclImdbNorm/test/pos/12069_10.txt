the war at home is so good it's become my new favourite show.me and my neighboors carly and april watch this together every sunday and laugh at how true to life it is.i love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they dwell on every little issue.once someone does something stupid they never live it down and that is soooo how family is.the father always harps on all three kids about every little thing.i love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids.it's so true to real family life and the fact that the parents are so overwhelmed and have no clue how to solve their teenagers problems just puts the show over the top.the war at home is so brutally honest,and so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come.this isn't happy days or the brady bunch this is real life.
