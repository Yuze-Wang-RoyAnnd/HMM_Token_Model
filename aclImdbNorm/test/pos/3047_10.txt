this film launched my theory about films based on books: instead of following the cliche "you've read the book; now see the film," if you are looking for a good book to read, try one upon which a movie you like was based, because it'll be 10 times better.<br /><br />i saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again. it's a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors, jon voight, with what became my favorite book, "the water is wide," by pat conroy.<br /><br />i can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. two tiny caveats:<br /><br />(1) the video suffers severely from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) the title should be restored to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most touching, enigmatic songs ever written
