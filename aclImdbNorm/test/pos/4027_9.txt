we saw la spettatrice last night @ the chicago international film festival & we were both immensely moved by it. this is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. the three leads (barbora bobulova as valeria, brigitte catillon as flavia, andrea renzi as massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. <br /><br />after all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see flavia (who is a law professor at a university in rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful. we're conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters 'the mix,' the older woman will become jealous of the younger woman, the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman, etc, etc. in this film, however, emotional truth is considerably more complex. highly recommended.
