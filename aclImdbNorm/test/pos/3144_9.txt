i saw this film on the same night i saw 6 other shorts. this one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. it comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.<br /><br />this is a great short film for the following reasons: <br /><br />1. amazing performances. the 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. the acting and directing are very powerful.<br /><br />2. beautifully shot. the lighting, framing and general filming are striking. the 35mm film sets this movie apart from other shorts. and what a difference it makes. the filming is worthy of this film stock.<br /><br />3. strong story. often short films try to do too little or too much with the time. or they are trying to tell a predictable story. this is a good balance of telling you an interesting story, without drawing it out too long or leaving you unsatisfied. you wonder what will happen next, while at the same time, feeling you saw something happen.<br /><br />nice score, too. compliments without overpowering.<br /><br />if you can find this at a festival, make an effort to see it.
