"rattlesnake! look out!" "is that a bra you're wearing or are you expecting an assassination attempt?" "spaz, what are you a homo or what?!" "ok way to go you guys! feed fink, he's our hot man" "do you know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the soviet union, east & west germany and the newest olympic power, trinidad-tobago." "oh spaz you old make-out master!" "what, no mustard?!" "oh my god his nose is bleeding." "it's gonna get even bigger now" "our political roundtable...henry kissinger will appear. yassir arafat is gonna come out, spend a weekend with the kids just rap with them."<br /><br />these and many other great lines make meatballs a hall-of-fame comedy. only in caddyshack is bill murray funnier. he probably ad-libbed half the lines. the high school actors seemed to have a blast being in the same movie with him.<br /><br />hilarious movie to watch any time of year, not just the summer.
