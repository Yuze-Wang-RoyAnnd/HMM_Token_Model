i don't particularly care from michael jackson. aside from being a pedophile, i really do not like his music, with the exceptions of a few songs from his landmark album, thriller. this is one of them. i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made.<br /><br />this was directed by john landis, best known to horror fans as the director of an american werewolf in london. this music video is not so much a music video but more or less, a short horror film. m.j. and his date are at a werewolf movie. when they leave the movie, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies, when michael jackson does his famous "thriller" dance.<br /><br />you know, this actually is a pretty good song with good synthesized beats. this and "beat it" are probably the only two michael jackson songs i can tolerate over and over. i especially love vincent price's cameo as the narrator. his distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. even if you don't like m.j.'s music, you need to see this video at least once. by the way, he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a fake nose.
