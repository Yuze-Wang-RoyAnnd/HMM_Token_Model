the movie was very good when it came out, i attended cooley high and cooley upper grade center ,around 1968 i was also home coming queen and grew up and lived in the area of cabrini greens, i knew a lots of people in the movie, it was nice to see friends in the movie that lived in the area also, and they had a chance to be a star that may have been a once in a life time experience for them, i had good times growing up on the north side and tough times i can relate to the movie cooley high is no longer standing but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had growing up attending cooley high, there is a lot of history around this north side area to be told .
