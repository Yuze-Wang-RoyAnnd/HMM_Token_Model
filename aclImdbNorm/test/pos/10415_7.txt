this picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by daniel boone in the wilderness of cumberland gap while being threatened by hostile indians. a treacherous frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while boone tries to convince the indians that the pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace. the film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes, although somewhat violent for its time. the cast is comprised of b actors but they are all good, especially lon chaney as the indian chief. bruce bennett is okay as boone but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a frontiersman. the dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the kentucky backwoods.
