since jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense.<br /><br />this little film is different. made in the early 80's it does what every good horror film should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. then, you make those horrors simmer, just don't turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering.<br /><br />the story features meg tilly right before she had a short-lived turn with fame starting with "the big chill" and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90's. meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls. they tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt. the mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward - further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her.<br /><br />meanwhile famed occultist karl rhamarevich has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command great magical powers. his daughter doesn't believe this at first, but she listens to a tape about her father's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw further power from these animations. she also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead. i think you know where this story is headed, so i'll stop here. did i mention the magician was entombed in the same crypt in which meg tilly's character is spending the night?<br /><br />i will mention that the commercial dvd containing this film does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently. i saw it on tv in the mid 1980's and i remember it looking better than this. the problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the dvd had to be created from a print. this means it comes complete with dirt and scratches.<br /><br />this is worth checking out for any horror fan. it was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on late night tv until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986. only tcm underground airs this kind of film anymore.
