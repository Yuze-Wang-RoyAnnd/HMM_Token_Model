this is possibly the most perfect film i have ever seen - in acting, adaptation and direction. it is self-contained and of a kind, so there is no point in saying that it is better or worse than other great films, just that it can stand by itself as a perfect work of art.<br /><br />and it was fun watching confused horror fans getting up and walking out!
