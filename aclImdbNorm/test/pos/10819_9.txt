first, a word of caution. the dvd box describes this film as a comedy. i don't think that was the intention of anyone connected with the film other than some marketing morons. while light and a little bit funny in places, it is not a comedy and if you expect that you will be disappointed.<br /><br />i had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other. considering that the other two dvds i picked up were big disappointments, i was so happy when i saw this film. the acting, writing and direction were excellent. the story itself definitely interested me, as you don't usually see films about the final month of france before the nazi takeover in 1940. it gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to partitioning their beloved country. along the way, there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by isabelle adjani--who looks marvelous after all these years. she kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall. this sap escapes from prison and finds her--with another lover--a high government official and weasel played by gerard depardieu. in addition, a subplot about a jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot. the story has a lot of nice twists and turns, a light sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some genuine suspenseful moments. together, they create a nice package this is sure to please.
