john landis truly outdid himself when he directed michael jackson's thriller as a short film. of course, it's corny, the dialogue is terrible and it all seems way too cheesy, but it's perfect none-the-less.<br /><br />michael and his date are out at the cinema to view the latest horror flick. when it all gets a little too graphic for the date, she leaves. michael follows. on the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local graveyard. there, it begins.<br /><br />the actual thriller dance is amazing. it's full of those trademark jackson moves, as well as some memorable zombie moves, too. it doesn't appear rushed at all, nor too long. the whole thing seems movie-like and it really is actually rather scary. of course, it's one of the most famous music videos of all time, and is probably the greatest music video ever made as well.<br /><br />overall: watch it, seriously. those 13 minutes will be some of the best ever spent staring at a screen. (5/5)
