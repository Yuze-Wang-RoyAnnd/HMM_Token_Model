excuse me if i'm wrong, but "cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most gretatest films in tne mexican movie history for a lot of reasons. we can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middle-class family breakfast: a cup of bu~nuel's surrealistic motifs with a little drop of ripstenian desolated scenarios; a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than todd solondz's happiness and the dogma movement films. there`s a lot of sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (teodoro's dream of fly), incestual lack of control (the relation between marcos and luzma), no-sense parallel stories, a discrete violence, anachronisms and<br /><br />a little sign of hope (spotlighted in luzma, the husband's home return and "un poco mas" used for leit-motif). marcos (bruno bichir) is a charming character ( i think in a bukoskian way), the king-without a-crown who don't expects for anything, but broken noses. luzma (maria rojo) , the lovable wife , put out a lot of faces, but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast; she' s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments , but you will fall in love of her. the soundtrack's drag (too much woods) feeds the lack of technical merits, intentional , of course: out-of-focus shots, overlighted close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts. "cr'onica" is something difficult to digest, it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it. it tastes bitter, like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk, but you want to enjoy it. so i recommend to get some melox before the show, because you won't get hungry after all.
