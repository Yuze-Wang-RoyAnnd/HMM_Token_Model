rififi deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene, and, indeed, that scene deserves all the credit it gets. it's a masterful piece of suspense, character interaction and photography. but rififi isn't just this one scene - every scene in the film is as masterfully put together, and as a whole, the film is not only taught with suspense, plot and character, but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to come.<br /><br />cinematically and technically, the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film, but for me, it's the final scene that holds the most power - tony le st'ephanois's hallucinogenic drive towards redemption.
