ok, i'm italian but there aren't so many italian film like this. i think that the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film but the final is too simple, too predictable. but it's the only little mistake. the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack. i'd like very much the lighting work on it. the best thing on it is a great, great actor. you know, if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance. but it's only a great theater italian actor called toni servillo. yes, someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it's too slow, it's so boring, so many silences, but i think that this components its fantastic, its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl, the grand-daughter of the italian actress anna magnani, olivia and the old mysterious man toni. one of my favorite italian films.
