this movie was groundbreaking in the former soviet union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene. however, the movie can be considered great for many reasons, not the least of which is its true, gritty portrayal of disillusionment and pain in the family of a working class soviet family. i would definitely recommend it.
