i'm slowly ploughing through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem - mainly due to ching wan lau who is one of my favourite actors.<br /><br />its a great action film although not as ott as the title might suggest. it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable.<br /><br />the biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack. it would appear that rob dougan - the guy who did the 'clubbed to death' song which was popular in 'the matrix' has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his 'furious angels' album; the tune in question is called 'im not driving anymore' and is also the opening tune for the tv series 'law and order' and the opening track on the 'matrix reloaded' dvd menu teaser! that really surprised me, due to the sheer conincidence!
