story of a strange love and a fall desire. poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch.a slice of visconti, mahler and mann. and an agonize venice. idon't know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director's world. it is, absolutely, a" memento mori". and a exploration of illusion. a old mirror of limits, signs and death's delicacy. a trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. "death" is a orfeu's trip copy in the immediate reality. and the essence is the music. a soft, sweet music, like honey or winter's fire. like every regret and every sorrow. like a refuge in deep solitude. gustav is gay by accident. he is the researcher of last form of god's presence. the beauty, that beauty who gives life's sense, who is sin and virtue in same time, the gift of expectations and sufferings. he dies because he has right to hope, to believe in the reality of miracle and in his way. a victim? no way! only tadzio may give the freedom like an insignificant sacrifice. who saw the sun can hope to live in same condition?
