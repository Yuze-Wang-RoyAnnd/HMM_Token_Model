this game was one of the main reasons i actually got a ps2. i remember playing soul edge (sometimes called soul blade) back in the day and i was hooked on it.<br /><br />i did play the original soul calibur but i never got a chance to play it for a huge amount of time. i did however buy the gamecube version of soul calibur ii and that was what truly got me hooked on the series and i was ecstatic when i heard of soul calibur iii. this game still gives us the classic characters such as mitsurugi, cervantes, nightmare and taki. however, it also adds several new characters such as zasalamel, tira and the unplayable night terror. (the true boss of tales of souls) the strategy based "chronicles of thes sword" mode is a new feature which i really like, it can be quite challenging in the later chronicles but it's a good addition to the series.<br /><br />the soul arena mode has several missions in which you must fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (the exception is "final battle" in which you simply must defeat night terror) it's another fine touch that makes the game all the more fun.<br /><br />in some scenes in tales of should you will be made to press certain buttons in order to get a different result, this can be in order to dodge/block an attack or to get a better ending. (every character has two endings) all in all, this is an excellent game and i'd recommend it if you're a fan of fighting games.
