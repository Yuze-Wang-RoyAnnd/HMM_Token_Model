what are the movies? i mean.. what are movies made for? shootings? killings? no. they are made for life stories and this is what this movie does. it presents how the life has changed between two ages. the father and a son, the father being in a need of a job and asking the son for help.<br /><br />although there is another generation, there are some characteristics which remain including the caress for the family.<br /><br />the main subject is, in my opinion the love of the son to the father and vice-versa.<br /><br />the movie is consisted of only one dialog but that dialog is more than i could ever wanted. this movie is a pure art! once again, after "marfa si banii", cristi puiu delivers us another beautiful movie. well done !
