try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. head is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. in less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.head is a reflection of those films. no matter how one feels about the monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium. had it not been for the film's unorthodox ad campaign (and the fact that by the time it came out the monkees so oversaturated the media that the public had become weary of them and every critic was ready to pounce on them) this could have had a much greater impact. studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what's actually in the film -and yet there are some great things in it (great songs, great cinematography, etc.) . should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of it's overall dreamlike feel. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change (thus the film's working title "changes") and head perfectly mirrors that time.
