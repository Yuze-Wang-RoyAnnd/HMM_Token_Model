as a modern marco polo, from venice to china, here we come amelio, again, taking on the task to render us the grey area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. eroded by globalization's collateral damages, the pessimistic vision of europe is mutual with chinas. <br /><br />the view of that charming but puzzling country is dealt from below, devoid of any claim to learn or impose opinions. reality, nonetheless, is harsh. abandoned and exploited children, beehive-homes, backward areas is the other china we ignore. vincenzo (castellitto), a technician of a steel factory, is one of us. his voyage to china is a pretext to understand, to learn from the inside a country where progress and third-world problems live together in an infamous balance. it's not exactly clear if vincenzo knew by the first time that the mechanical component was already been fixed, i think so; anyway is a minor aspect. liu, the chinese girl, is the key of the whole film. she carries on her back a lot of difficulties, she's got the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help ? <br /><br />the realistic and unbiased view of the facts by the girl, refusing vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. a pack of bank-notes can't get back her husband, her baby (forced to treat like a stranger for the law), protect her by scorns. liu knew his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold charity act. their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. a priceless legacy to keep.<br /><br />some scenes are stunning, either for the acting (vincenzo crying on the ferry) or by the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the railroads). besides a careless editing and a pretty lazy start, "la stella che non c'`e" is brilliant and sharp just because chronicles the untold verities.<br /><br />in competition at 63rd venice film festival, plenty bet on tai ling for the mastroianni prize, dedicated to emerging stars. she definitely deserved that award.<br /><br />[8/10]
