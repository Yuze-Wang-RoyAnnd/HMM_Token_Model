someone on these boards has predicated that the whole thing is being dreamed by the best friend of the protagonist, albeit a friend he hasn't seen for some 20 years. i'm reluctant to dismiss this out of hand but it does raise some viable questions. why would a telephone engineer - or a shoe salesman or butcher for that matter - want to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend populating it in the process with a set of equally mythical supporting characters. with an imagination that good the friend should be writing not dreaming. dream or not someone, and the obvious candidate is director paolo sorrentino, has created a very watchable world in which tony servillo makes stillness a fine art. we are asked to believe that forty-something titta la girolomo (servillo) 'upset' the mafia some years prior to our meeting him and as penance he is a virtual prisoner in a small swiss hotel from which each week he drives to a local bank with a suitcase containing nine mill large in used notes. other than this weekly trip he is free to do as he likes and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds the husband how far they have fallen socially, and ignore the friendly overtures of olivia magnani, who has spent two years trying to get a smile and/or a 'good evening' out of him. for reasons best known to himself and which are inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone, servillo spends a certain amount of time every day applying a stethoscope to the wall of his bedroom and listening to the private conversations of his card-playing partners. eventually he does respond to magnani - he has to do so or they would be no film. this is plot 6f: the one about destry, who never wears a gun, or sean (duke wayne), the 'quiet man' who refuses to rise to provocation and fight until the obligatory scene where the gun is strapped on and the fists cocked - but instead of contenting himself with a polite come stai oggi he removes 100,000 from the suitcase and buys her a car. the final inconsistency occurs when magnani tells him she will pick him up the following day at 4 pm in her car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday. we've established that she lives locally so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away, ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and overturn the car is anyone's guess. this inconsistencies apart this remains a fine piece of film-making with an excellent lead performance and a very good supporting one.
