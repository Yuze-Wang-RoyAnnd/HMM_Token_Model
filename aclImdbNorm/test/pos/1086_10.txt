this is by far one of the best films that india has ever made. following are the plus points of the film...<br /><br />wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.<br /><br />even though the film shows the life of mumbai policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.<br /><br />mind-blowing acting by lead actor nana patekar. one can surely hope that he gets nominated for the best actor for the academy awards.<br /><br />controlled violence. the violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.<br /><br />no stupid songs as in usual indian movies.<br /><br />
