the film opens in a stuffy british men's club full of gents in leather chairs smoking cigars. this is denistoun's world. a messenger delivers a small box to him which he opens to find a pair of gold earrings. the site of the earrings sets off a reminiscence about the time he spent in the company of gypsies. the rest of the film is flashback.<br /><br />golden earrings has been a long time favorite of mine and is probably the most romantic movie i know. dietrich plays against her usual type. here she's dark-haired, earthy and not in the least bit mysterious. instead of a femme fatale, she'a tower of strength and energetically sets out to use all her resources to help denistoun survive and reach his goal. to make sure that he's a really convincing gypsy, she pierces his ears and has him wear her dead lover's golden earrings. with his clothes and some grease, she transforms him from an effete british gentleman into a wild and sexy looking man. <br /><br />when i was growing up i used to hear the song "golden earrings" which is sung in the film. i think the tune is hummed a little by dietrich. /there's a story the gypsies know is true /that when your love wears golden earrings /she belongs to you.
