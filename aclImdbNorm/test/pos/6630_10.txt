this is a harrowing movie, and it moves relentlessly. still it is utterly unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on the civilian experience, the loss of humanity ordinary people undergo during wartime. the two young, married musicians undergo a slow, battering process of degradation at the hands of both sides of a civil war. utterly stripped of sentimentality, the film offers a bleak vision of the modern world, and one i believe particularly recognizable to many europeans. with brave, intense performances by liv ullmann (never better) and max von sydow (likewise). for my money, the most indelible film bergman ever created.
