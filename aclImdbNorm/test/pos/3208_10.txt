gilmore girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows i've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, f*r*i*e*n*d*s). the quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. just some random comments, i recently (finally) began watching season 6 and wow! it's one of my favorite seasons so far. i love the luke-lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exhilarating. the only thing i'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions rory has suddenly 'adopted'. unfortunately i don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong. all in all great season though and i can't wait for the next!!!<br /><br />~ ashly a.k.a.
