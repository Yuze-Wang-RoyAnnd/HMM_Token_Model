many of us who went through high school probably made it through alright without having to take a physics course - i know i didn't. but after watching this program, i surely wish i had.<br /><br />this documentary is a guide to the 'holy grail of physics' - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into one 'master equation' that eluded einstein during the last years of his life. brian green, a professor at columbia university, introduces us to this mind blowing theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe we live in.<br /><br />we start with the tantalizing possibility of a 'master equation' that could unite and explain everything... *everything!* in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and gravity. green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of newton, then einstein, and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level.<br /><br />but it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years, and one that no one has been able to solve just yet. how can we unify all these forces that we know together? we find, as green constantly points out throughout the problem - that the answer to this perplexing problem could be in the theory of strings. however, if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very big price to pay.<br /><br />it turns out that out of the mind numbing mathematical equations of string theory, that, as a consequence, we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with, not just 3 dimensions that you and i see every day plus 1 (for time), but rather, that we may actually live in a universe of *11* dimensions. but the math that arises out of that theory doesn't stop there - the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? as green points out; we have yet to fully find out, but we do know that the math that has arisen from these equations are already showing us that the universe still has much to show us.<br /><br />for those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts in this program - fear not. professor green does a wonderful job of doing away with the math and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the *concept* - which, when you take away all the math from it, transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and, as green constantly points out, 'elegant' concept. viewers of this program need no prior background in science; the concepts are so simple even a child could understand them.<br /><br />when you finish this program, you will truly come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe it is that we live in.
