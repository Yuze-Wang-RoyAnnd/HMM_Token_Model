this concert is the type of concert that only comes around every twenty years or so, madonna's confessions on a dance floor era will certainly be remembered as one of the high points of her career. she's 48 and she looks simply divine, she keeps up with the dancers that are almost twenty years her junior. i am also very glad to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because she actually sounds better live. each song was so unique, the visuals where stunning. the performance of 'live to tell' was fantastic and had me awestruck, 'isaac' was exotic and gorgeous and was rich with political symbolism, the arabic horn, the american eagle set free. i particularly liked the rockin performance of 'i love new york', i almost stood up in my lounge room and cheered when she told her critics to suck george bushes ****. and then again i was impressed by the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). this spectacular decedent concert made a fan out of me.<br /><br />verdict: highly recommended with a capital h.
