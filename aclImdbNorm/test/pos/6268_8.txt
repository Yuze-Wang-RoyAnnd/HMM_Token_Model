god bless joe d'amato...i love italian horror, cheese (movie-wise ;)), sci-fi, etc.<br /><br />this one, admittedly, was a bit harder to watch, but another fun bad movie.<br /><br />i like how people preface a negative review with "i normally enjoy bad movies, but..." no buts, this was a bad movie for people who love bad movies. it's one of my top bad movies.<br /><br />miles o'keefe was a poor man's conan, but oh what fun. who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster? it's fine to hate this movie if you only like hollywood drek like "titanic" or "pretty woman" but if you truly, i mean truly love bad movies, check this one out.<br /><br />this is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun.<br /><br />my rating 8/10.
