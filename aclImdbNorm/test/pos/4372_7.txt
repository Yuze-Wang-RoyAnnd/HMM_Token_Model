for those of you who like stand-up comedians you must have heard about george carlin. he is really one of the best comedians alive so you must know him.<br /><br />but he died already, god rest him in peace. or hell. he didn't believe too much in religion so he might as well chose hell to live eternity. haha, just joking, don't take it serious!<br /><br />it's bad for ya!, it's one of the latest works of george carlin, before his death--<br /><br />believe me, one of his best works, a must for any fan and an almost best-of of all george carlin's jokes. it's not a best-of... but it's really amusing.<br /><br />it has less political and religious jokes. it's only to have a great time!<br /><br />editing is very good. it's not a concert, so, it shouldn't have quick changing of shots... the slow fading to other shot was well done. fading is the best option in terms of editing!
