i like the show, but come-on writers, get some action in it! quit dragging it on and on. you have a great concept and it could be a whole lot more. miles (jenkins) is great and performs as a kid that age should act in the situation he finds himself in. hey, get creative with the creatures, they may have telepathic capabilities or other out-worldly powers. the kid actors in the series are very good and convincing. the parents of miles do appear to be a little too out-of-sense as to what is going on, but develop this, come on! you have a great seed here and there can be a whole new twist to next season with a lot of new characters and creatures and all kinds of neat sci-fi stuff. if they could make a series on a witch, then you should be able to make one on these creatures and kids.
