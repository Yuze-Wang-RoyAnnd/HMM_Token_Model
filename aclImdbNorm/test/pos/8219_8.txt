this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. sound familiar? <br /><br />there are plenty of holes in this story. things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny. but - that suspense is very good. there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it. the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way, making it an involving movie for the viewer. that's why i give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it. bullock is more cute than annoying, which she normally is to me, so this is my highest-rated movie with her in it.
