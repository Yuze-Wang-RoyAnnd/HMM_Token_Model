i seen this movie when it came out. i thought what an average movie. i have now realized that this director was ahead of his time. this is a great movie and great soundtrack. i have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap (which i did not like)> this film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but. this is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a *rock star* yeah i said it. everyone wants to grow up and be on the spot light( weather said or not). this movie just puts you in the core of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of izzy. i must admit the acting was less par but still the music and story was enough to hold you in to it, till the credits rolled. worth the watch especially if you are a fan of ye ole mighty hair bands.
