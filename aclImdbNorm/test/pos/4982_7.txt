the violent men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast.<br /><br />edward g. robinson is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers one of whom is glenn ford. ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance (may wynn) until robinson's ambitious brother (brian keith) murders one of ford's hands. then you know what happens next.<br /><br />barbara stanwyck is along as robinson's scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized. dianne foster plays their daughter who comes to admire ford.<br /><br />the violent men is nothing more than a "b" plot with an "a" movie cast but it is very well done.
