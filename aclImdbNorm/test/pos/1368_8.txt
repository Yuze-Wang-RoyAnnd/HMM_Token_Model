man, i can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art. but it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun. for starters, the titular pumpkin-headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera; he looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse. secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra-conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster. then there's the always welcome presence of the ever-lovely linnea quigley, who's memorably introduced taking a nice, long, utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes. amazingly, we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends john carradine as an evil warlock and cameron mitchell as a horror tv show host. moreover, scream queens brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith have fleeting cameos. lead child actor ryan latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump. pretty brunette rachel carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts. the cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special. the score is suitably overwrought. yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch.
