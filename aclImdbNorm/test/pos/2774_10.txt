don't you ever miss the good old days when disney actually made great movies that really moved you? growing up with disney i always found myself being captivated by the characters. every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. i remember friday nights and running to turn on the tv just to watch their newest movies. susie q was one of my all time favorites. i never forgot this movie. even till this day when one mentions the song "susie q" i always remember the movie. if anyone is thinking of watching this movie i promise you, you will fall in love with it. i don't think i will ever be able to forget it. you will not regret watching it. <br /><br />unfortunately it's sad to see disney movies such as "the hannah montana movie" come out. what ever happened to disney?
