didn't have much aspiration for this film, but was pleasantly surprised. very well made film, very well cut, doesn't really get to the height that human traffic did, but it's a very good effort. well directed, and i thought the lead actor put in a superb performance! in fact the only really bad performance in the film was from tim curry, who is supposed to be the name.<br /><br />cool film surprised it hasn't done better than it has. i'd never heard of it until i saw it at a mates.<br /><br />i'm not a raver, but i imagine people who are will really like this film.
