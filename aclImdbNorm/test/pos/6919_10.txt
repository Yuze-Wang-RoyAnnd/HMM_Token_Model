first off- what are some of you thinking? this is the best movie i've seen in ages! <br /><br />secondly- i don't think of it as a british movie as it is set in dublin and has mainly irish actors- moran, gambon, aisling o sullivan(rita), deirdre o'kane etc.<br /><br />thirdly- i thought that moran was excellent. he was hilariously funny through out. micheal caine seemed only to be there to get moran context. each character he took on he perfected. <br /><br />abigail iversen i thought was better than any other child actor i have seen. she was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adult(yes i know that sounds strange but hey...). even she managed to upstage caine. <br /><br />iversen and moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene.<br /><br />barreler(gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.
