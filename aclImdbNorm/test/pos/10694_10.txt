this is an action packed film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time i see it. the film (short of its conclusion) demonstrates that in the face of extreme odds, it is still possible to prevail.<br /><br />this film is very refreshing, and likely to be banned at any moment. get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can find. they don't want you to have hope for the future, or to think you have a chance.<br /><br />on the other hand, should political correctness fail to supress it, this would be an excellent movie to release on dvd. such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director, and related goodies. i'm sure it would sell some copies, and i would be one of the first to buy it.<br /><br />- mincka
