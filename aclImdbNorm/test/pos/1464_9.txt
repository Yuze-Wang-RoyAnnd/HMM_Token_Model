the first episode of 'man to man with dean learner' that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of 'garth marenghi's darkplace' and had me at "my maisonette". hope it keeps up the good work of 'faux terribles' on my tv. richard ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of "alternative comedy"(i hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one.) comedians on tv today.i'm glad that on a trip of local dvd retailers today "garth marenghi's darkplace" was sold out across the board. even from his brief stint in nathan barley i knew that ayoade was a serious talent and i'm sure he would have been great as dixon bainbridge in 'the mighty boosh' to continued success! in the vein of these programs i also felt it necessary to extend my review, in order to secure a place on this public domain.
