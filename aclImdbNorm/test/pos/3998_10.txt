this movie could be a bit boring for some people, but i find this film<br /><br />very interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition.<br /><br />the director, lim, has made two films about traditional music in korea before this film. the film before this one was showing the music throughout the film, and this film is trying to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the movie just like a painting.<br /><br />another thing is that, the story is written by both director and a philosopher, kim who is well known scholar in korea (holding a lot of degrees - including doctor at havard) i'm not saying that educated people make better films but that philosopher is an expert in traditional culture in korea, so it gives more credit on this film.
