i really felt the movie was ahead of its time. the one potential daughter-in-law was such a strong, career oriented woman. she knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the over-bearing mother-in-law to be. the mother's role was played extremely well (you just loved to hate her). her need to control her son's lives was neurotically evil. if you've ever been in a relationship where you've been judged and found lacking (and everybody involved knew it) this may hit too close to home. it's been years since i saw this movie and i remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50's or 60's movie. it is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons' dynamic but i would love to watch it again. i keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck. attempts to buy it were also futile (i don't believe it's on tape or dvd).
