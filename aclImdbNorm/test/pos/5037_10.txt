john travolta was excellent as "michael" in the movie by the same name. i don't think a better portrayal could have been done. the movie was funny, yet touching. michael is a very "human angel" (if their is such). andie macdowell is superb in her role as a reporter, as she goes from disbelief to belief. bill hurt and robert pastorelli are great as fellow reporters, each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth. each of the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the older woman (i do not know her screen name), who plays michael's mother! one of the cutest movies i have seen in years... i could watch this movie dozens of times!
