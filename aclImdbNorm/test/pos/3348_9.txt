i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.<br /><br />personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'alice in wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on dvd so it was an obvious choice to complete my dvd collection with this. i must admit i was scandalized beyond my expectations, and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadn't been so damned funny. besides, the music is really good and i like musicals.<br /><br />not everyone can make a good nudie musical. anyone that has seen 'the first nudie musical' knows what a stink-bomb that was. considering what a low budget bill osco worked with, 'alice' is pretty remarkable as a musical(it's better than some musicals made on costly budgets).<br /><br />the film can't totally escape the dirtiness of porn. i usually watch the xxx version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are scandalizing(scandalizing because we are talking about lewis carroll). i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where 'alice'(kristine debell) starts masturbating. it made me feel like a voyeur. and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with 'alice' and the kitty-cats were a bit too racey.<br /><br />the film has a great sense of humor about everything however. there is one especially funny moment during the queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says "who do i have to f---k to get out of this movie?". hilarious.<br /><br />i'm not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here, but sex is human, and nothing human disgust me.(i don't know if i really feel that way, but i couldn't resist saying it)some people think everything should be about sex. i dunno. jeez, just show some frick'in responsibility and decorum. this movie definitely scores points for the sex-minded, but i wouldn't push your luck, next time you might really freak someone out. i mean we are dealing with children's literature here.
