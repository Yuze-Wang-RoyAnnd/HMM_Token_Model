mark blankfield (from the old late night tv show "fridays")plays dr. daniel jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. this was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. this is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains. there's a few subplots like jekyll's fianc'ee, who is the daughter of the head doctor at our lady of suffering and pain, jekyll's employer. and there's tim thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" parts and a taste for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of howard hughes, and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants, including testicles. yeah, the humor is raunchy and silly, and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless, but if you're not above a quick wallow in the gutter, you'll probably like it just fine. now available on dvd too, for the first time! woohoo! 7 out of 10.
