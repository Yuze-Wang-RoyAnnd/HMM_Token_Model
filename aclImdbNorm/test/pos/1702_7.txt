i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london & paris. let me start by saying "london" still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive, the film was funny, and scary, also a bit of gore....now lets get to "paris" its enjoyable, a few scars, lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it's time, the transformations al'a cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original. i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable, i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it...go figure...julie delpy was competent as was the direction it's the script that lacked a bit of shine & finesse. i read here that john landis was supposed to direct to bad he didn't i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether. i also noticed some discussion of a sequel "what if" well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title "an american werewolf comes home" or in dc that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare. you simply must see the original in it's new dvd transfer with dolby 5.1 sound and see both of these on an hdtv with upconvert turned on...nice!!!!
