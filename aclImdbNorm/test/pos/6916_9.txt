i thoroughly enjoyed this made for tv movie. i was channel surfing, and came across the start of the movie. boy am i glad i stopped. this movie has a real hot cast, as well as a semi-believable plot. there's drama, comedy, action, and best of all, the human nature aspect of this film is what makes it great. i hope it comes out on video, because i will buy a copy. rating...9 out of 10 stars
