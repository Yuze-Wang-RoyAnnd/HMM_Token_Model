i really like this show. it has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. i am 28 and i am a married mother, so i can identify both with lorelei's and rory's experiences in the show. i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately, so i am not up-to-date on what is going on now. i think females would like this show more than males, but i know some men out there would enjoy it! i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it! give it a chance if you have never seen the show! i think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though, mainly because of the way they are with one another. how could you not see something was there (or take that long to see it i guess i should say)? <br /><br />happy viewing!
