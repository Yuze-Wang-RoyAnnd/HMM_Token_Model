i remember seeing this movie as a child in the 60's. it took my breath away then at young age. i was glued to my seat in front of the black and white tv. the cast was one of the best i have seen in my life. the musical was one the greatest ever have been written. please to the gershwin and goldwyn families please release this on video or dvd so that the generations now and in the future can experience what i'm sure what so many of us have done when we saw this great work of art .please consider, let not this great man's work go unseen for years more. i,m praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will be soften and let the world see this great movie again.
