a magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a ny apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend christmas with her. after a slow start, it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. in a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in "double indemnity," stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while greenstreet is well cast as the publisher. however, sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the english language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible european accent.
