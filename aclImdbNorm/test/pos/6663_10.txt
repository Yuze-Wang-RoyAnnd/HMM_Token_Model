this movie moved me more than i was expecting, and i was fully prepared to cry. the acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from jude law, nicole kidman and renee zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. these actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and i had trouble shaking this war drama. the costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. they didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. cold mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to the english patient, but it's in the top five. the story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. i did not find myself guessing what line came next. a heart-wrenching story about humanity and war. in fact, this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century. it seemed to apply to all times.
