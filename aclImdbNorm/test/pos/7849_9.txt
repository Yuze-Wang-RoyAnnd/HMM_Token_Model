the beguiled was one of the few early eastwood films i hadn't seen until i gave the dvd a spin today. and from it's opening sepia-tinged shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled. too many film-makers these days substitute special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera-work in place of character-driven stories, but director don siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are believable and compelling.<br /><br />the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the american civil war. the south-supporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier (clint eastwood); nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends.<br /><br />geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed. for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest. there's even a chance that the normal status quo, long abandoned when eastwood's machinations are uncovered, could return; but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road...<br /><br />this is a totally different style of film from the same director's dirty harry, made in the same year, and yet they are both equally superb. eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, yet there's also some mysterious quality attached to his character. we never really learn much about him prior to his incarceration, and the viewer is free to decide upon his well-shaded persona. villain or victim? whatever you think, all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed it.
