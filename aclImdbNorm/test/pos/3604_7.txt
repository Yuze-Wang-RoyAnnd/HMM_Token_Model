a nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. i think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. one thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'mandras' and pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. i mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot. irene papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, living in a island during the 40's, who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. john hurt, pelagia's father, also acted great. he reminded me a greek in many of his reactions.
