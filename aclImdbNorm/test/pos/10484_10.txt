sublime--perfect--profound--a true lesson on the idealized meaning of life. we get completely caught up in the life journeys of martina and phillipa and<br /><br />babette. their yearnings, desires, sacrifices resonant long after the movie has ended. seeing it years ago--as it was gaining a great deal of notoriety at the audaciousness of its subject matter--half the movie being a single dinner--the audience was "oohing and aahing" as some of the courses took their final<br /><br />glorious shape, laughing at the reaction of the diners, as they became totally seduced by the gustatorial pleasures being introduced to them by babette, and being totally surprised at the turn of events at the end of the film. subsequently seeing the film years later after my own twists and turns of life, i realized just how profound the film is. on this viewing tears flowed freely. the film's<br /><br />meditation on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and generosity is truly something to<br /><br />cherish.
