a unique blend of musical, film-noir and comedy - with a few sex scenes thrown in for good measure. the only other film i can think of with a fairly similarly wild and madcap mixture of themes and clich'es is the french movie billy ze kick - but that has a more surreal and quirky approach.<br /><br />not that this film would not be surreal or quirky. the humour is at times quite subtle, at other times blatantly in your face - and often crossing the border to offensiveness. to give an example: in the post-coital chit-chat with a prostitute our hero max m"uller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder, using the words "schiess los!". literally, this phrase means "shoot!" in german, and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response. in other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun.<br /><br />m"ullers b"uro is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes. larry's romance is accompanied by the song "ich will mehr" (i want more) - while the song perfectly underpins the action, the meaning of its words changes a couple of times, hinting at the end at larry's inability of providing any further service. the film's main love scene between max m"uller and bettina kant lacks such subtlety - this is jaw-dropping stuff, especially when bettina's singing slowly transgresses into moaning, of course all in the rhythm of the music.<br /><br />unmissable, unless you are one of the easily offended.
