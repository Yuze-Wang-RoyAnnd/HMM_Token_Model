this movie features some of the best ensemble work i've seen in film or on stage. the actors play off each other with a skill and vivacity that in no way can be achieved through editing.<br /><br />"love jones" a good story, period. but it is also an excellent portrayal of the urban, middle-income, twenty-something african-american set that is not often seen.
