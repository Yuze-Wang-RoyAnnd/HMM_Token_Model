i saw this years ago, and it's entertaining, but not profound. the basic story is of a young man who dreams of midian, though he's not sure where it is or even if it really exists.<br /><br />spoilers follow: he finally visits it, gets transformed to a nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one. then, he has to help the other members of the nightbreed because they're being attacked by canadians. (save for the accents, they all act like good ol' boys. not much in tune with the canadian psyche, eh?) someone observed for "monsters" or "nightbreed," substitute "jews," and for the canadians/humans, substitute, "nazis," and you're supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans. well, maybe.<br /><br />one major objection i had was that while the underground city was interesting, it was rather ramshackle and, frankly, dirty. this must be a convention for movies with underground settlements. one would think that if the monsters were the good guys, some would have at least a little sense of decor.<br /><br />the storyline is a tad thin, but that's to introduce characters. but it's entertaining enough for a repeat view.
