i've never watched a file in a language i don't understand just because i wanted to see the movie and i couldn't find it with english subs. i don't know how much i missed but it wasn't much. probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. i want to mention to the diceman from germany there's no reason to feel that he 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. like i said, i don't understand japanese -or at least only the very small amount i came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- bably my favorite all time book which i could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading! i don't know if there's an english dubbed or subbed version but if the film but if there is i'd love to see it. the film was incredible in japanese anything better is icing of the cake!! slainte', maegi
