my favourite story from 'tales from the crypt'. brion jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack,axe swinging madman steve dixon.having seen him before in tango&cash i can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved. a jealous husband takes offence in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he's just employed.and you know when dixon finds out there's gonna be hell to pay!the young worker ted(billy wirth)receives an almighty beating from dixon leaving him blind.now how is a blind lumberjack supposed to work? a tribute to black humour if there ever was one! the co stars do a pretty good job too supporting ted when dixon when he has his initial suspicions about his wife desiring another man.dixon's behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues.one even stated he became a changed man when he got married.though ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could!
