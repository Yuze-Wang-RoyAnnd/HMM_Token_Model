grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's nearing 4 am here), and because it's norwegian, which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now. a droll and deliciously wry romp, this movie features a man, andreas, who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city, where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste, nothing smells, and even sex loses its appeal. driven to the edge by his lack of common senses, he feels nearly ready to kill himself.<br /><br />after an hilarious botched attempt at latter, andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates. the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side, tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see. but of course, in fantasy allegory land, desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end andreas' attempt at freedom and sensuality.<br /><br />jens lien and crew create a simple, straight-forward movement to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging. the similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating, but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones. i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray-toned mise-en-scene. trond fausa aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings, which works very well. despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about, everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world.<br /><br />--polarisdib
