four or five episodes of johnnie socko and his flying robot edited together. amusing giant robot battling giant monsters tale aimed squarely at kids. parents of course will go crazy since the action is violent with the robot/monster battles resembling professional wrestling and the human on human violence the sort of stuff you'd find in the al capone st. valentine's day school and gangster training academy. i liked it, but then again i grew up on the series. if there is any problems, other than the "men in suits" effects variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes stitched together, with a climax coming every 20 minutes. recommended for those who've run out of ultraman or godzilla
