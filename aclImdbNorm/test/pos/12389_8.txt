it kept me on the edge of my seat. true, the story has a few plot holes, but the sheer tension of it, the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is simply fascinating.<br /><br />jos'e coronado and adriana ozores are two of spain's best actors (see la vida mancha and h'ector) and here they appear as a happy upper-middle class couple. beneath it all, the truth is that all of coronado's life is a lie. he's not an economist, never went to college or does not work in spain's central bank reserve, as everybody else believes. we get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it, and while not very plausible it is still somehow believable.<br /><br />the inner-workings of the scam are shown intermittently, but it is credible because coronado is a source of self-assurance and assertiveness. he not only believes in the scam, he also believes in the film premise, and therefore he carries it.<br /><br />sure, it tests belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriage's finances for almost 10 years, but again, since he's supposedly a brilliant economist.<br /><br />it has been said, in a nationalistic tone, that the movie is not "distinctively spanish", as if that were a litmus test for good film. true, no castanets or odd cabbies in this one, just a taut thriller. you'll want to know how this story ends once you start watching.
