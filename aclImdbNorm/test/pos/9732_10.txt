this is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired, or impaired in some other way... the acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet, moving it about. the movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder. when i saw this movie for the first time, a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and i were calling each other names from this flick, that's how terrible it was. if you enjoy getting mad at movies, i recommend this to you, otherwise, flee as though your very life depended on it.
