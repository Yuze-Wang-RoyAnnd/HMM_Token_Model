eliza (elizabeth moorman) is a farm girl from the country coming to the city looking for love. she has met a man that has told her of an astrologist who will show her the stars. this is a journey of souls...eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? tommy (tommy lee jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage. they show each other different ways of looking at things. all the while eliza is still looking for love and tommy is trying to protect the reservation that his grandmother lives on. this is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things. the style is artsy and chock full of symbolism. the psychedelic camera styling might scare away the average moviegoer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching. it is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird, wretched and devastated individuals. this one strays from the path but certainly worth watching!
