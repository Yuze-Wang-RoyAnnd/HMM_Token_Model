this movie literally had me rolling on the floor (well at least on the couch) laughing. i didn't think i would like it, but it came on cable tv one afternoon, and i watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself. since then, i've also seen black sheep, which was pretty good, but not as non-stop-funny as tommy boy.
