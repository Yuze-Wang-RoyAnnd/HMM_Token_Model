i chose "the english patient" for a history extra credit assignment. i thought that this movie would be incredibly boring. instead, it has become one of my favorites. it portrays life in wwii quite accurately, and the love story is amazing. the love story made the movie so incredible. i felt this interesting feeling, of passion or something. it made me want to watch the movie over and over again. kristin scott thomas and ralph fiennes are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing. the look wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love. i recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity, or for an assignment.
