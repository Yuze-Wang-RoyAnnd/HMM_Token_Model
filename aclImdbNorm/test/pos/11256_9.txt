this movie was amazing. never before have i seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use quite like this one. there is no glamorizing, sugar coating, or glorifying heroine. this movie shows the true struggles, pain, and loss people go through when dealing with this drug. good film, decent emotionally packed acting, and a great storyline. a much watch!<br /><br />
