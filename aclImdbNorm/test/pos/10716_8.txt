the academy award winning 'kramer vs. kramer' follows a snazzy businessman ted kramer (dustin hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (meryl streep). one day ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life, forcing ted to become closer to his son (justin henry). the two bond and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfect ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son. ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him, and fights his wife in court. dustin hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with meryl streep, and young justin henry is impressive. it's a sad emotional roller-coaster of a movie, but it's a very well-made and inspiring film. the film took the oscar for best picture at the 1979 academy awards, along with best actor for hoffman and best supporting actress for streep. if you don't mind a tearjerker, 'kramer vs. kramer' is a great film to watch. grade: b+
