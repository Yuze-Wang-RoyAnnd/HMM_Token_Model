i thought this movie was great! i saw this when it came out in the theaters so i do not remember all the details. i remember it being based on homer's tale on odysseus. names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale. <br /><br />i found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it. i really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the romeo and juliet with clair danes.<br /><br />i will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors.
