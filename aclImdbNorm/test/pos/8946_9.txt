two funeral directors in a welsh village? english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic? how could i resist. my wife and i saw it on march the 6th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs. we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening.<br /><br />the mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait. it raises issues rarely talked about in the community, but i know three funeral directors, and the humour is right on the money<br /><br />highly recommended and congratulations to the writers. without you all the actors, directors and the others havn't a job on any monday.
