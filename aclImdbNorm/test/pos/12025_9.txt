this bravo special is one of the most purely entertaining things i've ever seen on tv. unlike me first & the gimme gimmes (the worlds foremost punk-supergroup/cover-band), the dan band really must be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />on paper, the dan band is just a one-joke act- guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into the lyrics. if you listen to their "dan band live" cd, that's all you'll get, and it'll get old quick. (i only bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the tv special.) but what's made dan finnerty a hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage presence. this guy owns his audience for every second he's onstage. and the backup singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well. as for the actual band- they stay out of sight for the most part, but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical lounge-act backing band. hopefully, a dvd version will be released soon- there were almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy censoring adds a bit of unintentional humor, it also removes the intentional humor.<br /><br />if there is any sense in the world, the vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who can build dan his own showroom faster.<br /><br />"re-------member my name...fame!"
