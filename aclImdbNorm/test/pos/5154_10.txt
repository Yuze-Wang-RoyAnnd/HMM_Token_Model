i laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether. i adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux. andersson gives us something else here. shows us something i had not seen since his last film. he is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. it is powerful stuff. it is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity. everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. i believe most scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch according to his designs. i cannot recommend this film highly enough. for me it took me to a place and i came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful, starched and pained, barren and splendid. at once alien and familiar. this film is brilliant and life affirming. i know because i came out smiling feeling wonderful. it has taken him seven years to make this. if he only made this one film he would still be up there with the greats.
