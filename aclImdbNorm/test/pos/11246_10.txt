the fact that reviewers feel very intensely negative towards the show is an interesting fact all its own. if you dislike it so much, don't watch it.<br /><br />certain reviewers assert that you have to be dumb, dim-witted, or plain old primitive to enjoy this show. au contraire, my friends. i am not claiming that all the contestants are smart. there are smart ones, and there are dumb ones. but i would argue that they probably have a higher average iq than the average reviewer on this website. thats right, i said it. there is a lot to be said for the science of seducing girls. i'm sorry, but please withdraw all sticks out of your asses, and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten you.<br /><br />those oblivious to social sciences, and more specifically, the science behind mating are clearly going to miss the boat completely.<br /><br />one thing is clear: the clubs aren't the only places to meet girls. i personally think that the worthwhile women don't even go to clubs, so that they won't fall prey to men like the ones we see on the show. but what are men like these???? apart from the ones whose games stink, they are the epitome of men. they are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. these are men who take ownership of their own sexuality. these men don't beg for their girlfriends to not break up with them, and these men don't say "ok" to the phrase "let's just be friends". <br /><br />sound familiar???? in fact, these are the very guys you're afraid of when you take your special long term girlfriend to the club. we all are. these guys know what women like. (again, only the ones who have "game")<br /><br />and even the ones who are bad...they are worth a laugh! <br /><br />if you have gone out to a club, and actually interacted with the people around you, you should find this show entertaining. <br /><br />look, i am at a loss for why there is so much hate for this show. my best guess is that it aggravates the insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe women are beautiful self-less creatures who just want a nice guy to buy their attention.<br /><br />i personally love this show. it is pure entertainment, and best of all, its real. it is a very perceptive take on the most recent state of sexual psychology. sex roles have never been so different from before, and this show provides a very real view of that,<br /><br />i think it actually takes some intelligence to take away something positive from this show. <br /><br />this show appeals to a certain target market, and if you're outside of that, then i guess you shouldn't tune in to the show. we could say this about any other shows though, couldn't we?<br /><br />grow up,<br /><br />apollohelios
