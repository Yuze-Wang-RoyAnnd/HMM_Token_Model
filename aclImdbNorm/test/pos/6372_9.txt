a great show.<br /><br />first, to the people who don't like it..don't like it, then don't watch it...<br /><br />this is(was) an awesome show. better than according to jim (a favorite of mine). it shows a real family household (as opposed to 8 simple rules,etc, where everything goes peachy).<br /><br />they're loud, they're messy....i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen. it happens in real life..sorta like the "portal to hell", and everyone growling like dogs over the fast-food boxes.<br /><br />it's a "been there" show....you know what's coming, but fun to watch, because you have been there before.<br /><br />a good cast, they work great together, a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release. mel gibsons "safety videos" were a highlight of the series as well.<br /><br />opinion? good show, really deserving of a dvd release (deserving to not be canceled as well).
