*may contain spoilers*<br /><br />the first time i saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when i was around 8 years old. now i am 17 and still watch it whenever i get a chance to. "the aristocats" was a cute heart warming film that i immediately fell in love with. i loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. in fact i even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since i loved it that much. all three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats i ever saw. the ally cat had a great voice!<br /><br />my favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano. that part is adorable. i also enjoy their journey home. it's incredible. this is one of the best disney films i ever saw and one of my favorites. everyone should see it. i give this film 10/10 stars.
