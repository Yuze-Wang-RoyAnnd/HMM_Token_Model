i spotted this film in a branch of the duane reed pharmacy in new york on holiday, and it seemed like a bit of silly fun. and sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids, and their parents too.<br /><br />10-year-old ricky bernard (jordan garrett) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to his father's (larry miller) dismay. as a member of his school orchestra, ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance ... and once again ricky's mind 'takes off' and suspects some criminal plot is happening.<br /><br />reluctantly aided by best friend sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot device that was) and others they try to get to solve the mystery. oh yes, and ricky's skills 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film's thrilling climax! it was good to see eric roberts and mark dacoscos play parts in a family film. and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part.<br /><br />i totally liked junior pilot; charming and good-natured performances, funny plot line and a real; sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness.<br /><br />if you are looking for an entertaining family film, you could do far worse than buy this one.
