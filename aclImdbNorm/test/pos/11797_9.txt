on more than one level, i can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way. and all i can say about it is, that it's true, what dexter's mom tells eric at the end of the story: he actually did 'cure' her son, by taking away his sad feelings and his loneliness.<br /><br />this movie emphasis a philosophy i can very well agree with. we are all going to die one day sooner or later. in the end, it is not the amount of time we live, but the fun/good times/happiness we have during that time. it is not the quantity, but the quality that counts.<br /><br />i guess all other words used here would only keep you any longer from getting to see this movie, if you haven't already. i really would like to see it released on dvd. definitely it would be added to my 'all time classics' right away!
