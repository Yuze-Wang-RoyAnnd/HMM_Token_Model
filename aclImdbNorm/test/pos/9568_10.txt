this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever. chritopher guest is truly talented. he has a gift for humor. i almost died laughing. actually, when i saw this in theaters, i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb. but it is dumb in a good way. it is funny-dumb. and this is a really good combination. you will be laughing from start to end.<br /><br />this mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the kennel club dog show. the cast includes parker posey, fred willard, eugene levy, catherine o'hara, john michael higgens, michael mckean, larry miller, bob balaban, jennifer coolidge and tons more. <br /><br />this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing. someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. best in show: 5/5.
