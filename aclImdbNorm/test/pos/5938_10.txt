if you enjoyed the tv series, diagnosis murder, you'll love murder 101. it's great to see dick van dyke in a murder mystery again. if we're lucky, this one will be a start of a tv series or at least series of movies.<br /><br />this movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles. but, it didn't feel like a "face" movie. it was really a story that drew you in making you forget about the fame of those on the screen.<br /><br />i made a guess as to the ending and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that i had to watch it again! this is a must see for any mystery buff or dick van dyke lover!
