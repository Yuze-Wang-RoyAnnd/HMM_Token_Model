i saw this film when it was released to theaters. it's definitely one to remember, i had forgotten the title until recently. a friend found it via online search.<br /><br />one dark night is rather unusual for the suspense/horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood. it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways. it's a nice, old-school film with props and scenes that reflect the times. our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket, for example.<br /><br />as has been mentioned by previous reviewers, one dark night is currently available on dvd. the original negative was not available for the dvd transition. some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesn't take away from the story. that being said, the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good.<br /><br />adam west plays a rather smallish part in this film as raymar's son-in-law. his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short.<br /><br />the story builds over the course of the film. unlike many horror films of the era, one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening.<br /><br />the final 20 minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable. raymar's telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum, pull the coffins out, open them and move the corpses around. attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes. the rotting, worm-riddled corpses look quite real.
