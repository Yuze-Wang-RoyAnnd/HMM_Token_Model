this is my favorite love story it has every element that a good love story should have. poetry, jazz, friendships the ups and downs in a relationships. finally a movie that shows positive aspects of the black community. larenz tate was great i can't picture anyone else playing the role of darius. he recited that poem like he had written it himself and meant every word. i own this movie and if i had the time i would watch it everyday it always makes me feel better and that's what a good movie should do. also, the character savon could not had been any better dealing with the subject of marriage. we would all like to find a darius out there but most of us just settle for watching this movie. my vote is 10/10
