mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. now i think paul schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but i don't really like the films he's directed of what i've seen (with the exception of this and affliction), but this is an amazing, disturbing, and highly 3-dimensional character study. it follows the life of yukio mishima, japan's most celebrated writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. i don't know how, but paul schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way. the acting is great, so is the photography, and a perfect score by philip glass. although confusing the first viewing, this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing. truly an underrated gem of a film.
