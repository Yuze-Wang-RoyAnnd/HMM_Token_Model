i have a little hobby of finding really cool pics out there that are pretty much unknown -and then letting people know about them this one is on top of my list for getting the word out this summer. this indie film (and i really mean indie--not miramax, fox searchlight indie) might be easy to overlook in the big maze of celluloid, but if you want something completely different--you have to check this one out. <br /><br />basically, i thought it was totally great. i should have known from the dvd cover, front and back ,that this was going to be something totally different, but, they all say that their stuff is different to hook you. well this one really is totally different. it's in your face: beautiful and scary and unashamed to tell you to wake up. war, peace, 9/11, poetry, even a eerie sort of music video set to an old time "patriotic" song and a weird guy in an rv. need i say more? just see it.
