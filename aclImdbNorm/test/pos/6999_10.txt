"pitch black" was a complete shock to me when i first saw it back in 2000. in the previous years, i was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci-fi movies (ex: starship troopers) and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different. but to plainly put it: this movie freaked me out... in a good way. i wasn't aware that i was still afraid of the dark till i watched this movie; i must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when i was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there.<br /><br />the alien creatures sent shivers up my spine; the individual(s) who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. <br /><br />i loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion.<br /><br />riddick's (vin diesel) gift for escaping out of any impossible situation and putting up a hell of a fight was jaw dropping. at first, you figure him out to be a coldly intelligent villain but in some brief moments, you can see something humane behind his animal side. but as soon you discover it, he does something maliciously devious. he certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end. i didn't know whether to despise or admire him... he's definitely a love/hate type of character.<br /><br />johns (cole hauser) was a perfect example of a character that puts up a good front but through a need for greed, shows his real intentions and what he's willing to do to survive. john's knack for knowing what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as devious as riddick.<br /><br />fry (radha mitchell) is a character who, as johns so nicely expressed, looked to her thine own ass first before considering the consequences. but what's endearing about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay penance, even while endangering her life when others discarded all human values and went for the dark hills running.<br /><br />jack (rhiana griffith) simply wanted to have a hero and was the first one out of the whole group to look for that hero in riddick; through a child's eye, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. i thought it was absolutely priceless when jack shaves his head in ode to riddick; you know what they say: imitation is the best form of flattery.<br /><br />imam (keith david), like jack, has the ability to see good in any evil. he uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships that he meets and when time permits, he rationally grieves his losses and then soldiers on. in a way, he served as a morale booster for the survivors even though most of the characters acted as though they weren't listening.<br /><br />the casting for this movie was positively perfect. each actor shined brightly in their role and their talents blended wonderfully on-screen.<br /><br />this movie may have had a small budget but the director's leadership and the actor's performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive special effects do all the work for them. this movie is a definite sci-fi classic. watch it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. it will be well worth it.
