every time i hear karen carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. what an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. cynthia gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, i thought karen allen would have been a better choice. this is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of karen and richard but also the personal struggles that karen dealt with and her disease. the recording sessions in herp albert's studio are very nicely done. however karen carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers. even if you weren't a carpenter's fan this is a nice story that depicts how a great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society.
