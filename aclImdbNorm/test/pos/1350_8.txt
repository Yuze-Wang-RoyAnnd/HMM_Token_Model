i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good saturday night movie. i wasn't expecting anything great, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience. i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />the dialogue was pitch perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. ash christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see. he could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character. it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again, i didn't know what he would do after tarnation. ashley fink is gem, a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work.<br /><br />there are moments in the film that could have used some work, but all in all not a bad time at the cinema. my friend described it as a gay angus/napoleon dynamite but it's something more than that. it's a character study into what it's like to grow up gay in a small town, the pain is there but the humor behind that pain (that only age can make clearer) is magnified. i look forward to seeing more of ash christian, ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon.
