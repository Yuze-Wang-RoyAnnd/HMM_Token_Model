i loved this movie the first time i saw it. it gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air: notably jane craig rushing kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then joan cusack struggling to get it in, and william hurt, who according to jane commits an incredible breach of ethics, fakes his tears during his date rape interview, a flaw that is pointed out by aaron. another high point is when tom uses jane for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with jennifer. the script is brilliant, and the directing is almost as good. all three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters, especially holly hunter, and albert brooks, whom is the funniest in the film. william hurt is also very good. this deserved at least three oscars, best actress(holly hunter), best supporting actor (albert brooks), and best picture. i liked the last parts of the film where it shows them reuniting 7 years later.<br /><br />8/10
