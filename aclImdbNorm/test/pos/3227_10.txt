gilmore girls is my favorite tv show of all times. they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but i've watched the rest on dvd or read it online. it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't sneaking around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. the chemistry between lauren graham and alexis bledel who play lorelai and her daughter rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, though extremely quirky, are still believable. the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life, which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of lorelai's parents. on one hand there are dance-athons and firelight festival's while on the hand you have cotillions, dar meetings and cocktail parties. all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend lane's. basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended.
