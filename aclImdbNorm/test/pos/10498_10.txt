i saw this movie awhile back and can't seem to track it down. does anyone know where i can get a hold of it? i feel it is worth seeing again.<br /><br />i'm sorry to say i had never heard of chloe nicholle until this film. yes she can act. when i first began to track this movie down i mistook it for another one of her movies, sex spa. the plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed.<br /><br />this is the first film i've seen dru berrymore. i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde. <br /><br />i agree this is a good introductory movie. not too soft. not too hard. you got to start somewhere.
