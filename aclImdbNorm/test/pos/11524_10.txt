serendipity. i thought i was off to a bad start, bringing home the wrong dvd in the case of "the intruder". rental stores' staff! so i did not want to see this film but i am glad i did. in all probablility my chosen movie would not have been as superb a slice film as this delectable and delicate taste of what independants in both us and europe can do together. seven years apart, two heroine sisters embark on fantastic journeys through early 1970's post-student demo / baader-meinhof europe. sumptuously shot in the algarve, portugal; and in berlin, paris, and amsterdam (reminiscent of the feel of the exterior shots in paul verhoeven's early masterpiece, "the fourth man"), it's touchingly acted by brewster , diaz and especially christopher ecclestone.the story unveils itself along an abstracted plot, capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see idealised images of each other and themselves shattered. a movie with great refinement and taste. not for arnie commando fans, which is probably why the reviewer upstairs is so wide of the mark in 'his' claims that this is a girly film. daft criteria. wrong too. well worth experimenting with.
