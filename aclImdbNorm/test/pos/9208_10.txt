i would like to vent my displeasure at nbc canceling las vegas. the show had been top notch for the past 5years. tom sellecks addition was great. he really brought a nice fresh addition to the show. what does nbc have now? lame reality and night time game shows. i mean come on keep the old and tired law and order? not even putting jack mccoy as da can keep the show interesting. gee let's keep quality program like deal or no deal or ed? er should be put out to pasture to. nbc is worse now than it was in pre seinfeld cheers days. with cable and internet, nbc cannot afford to fall flat on its face.please bring back vegas! i remember when homicide life on the street ended the way it did. at least they had a two hour series final. hey cbs are you listening? please pick up vegas it is a great show.
