but a great cast! jonathan pryce, kathy bates, rupert everett, lynne redgrave, julie andrews and dan aykroyd! and that's just the beginning.<br /><br />i'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. oh, and a psychotic. and barry manilow.<br /><br />you will have to trust me when i say that 50% of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the absurd gene in your dna makeup. it's not your fault; it's hereditary. the other 50% of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes, but you have to keep watching.<br /><br />even at that, at the end you may wonder why you watched... but keep in mind that absurdity thing. it should grow on you. it is a test.
