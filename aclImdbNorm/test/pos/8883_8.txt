stars: danny devito, billy crystal, anne ramsey, kim griest, kate mulgrew, oprah winfrey and rob reiner.<br /><br />after college class, teacher larry (crystal) wants his ex-wife dead and owen (devito) wants his momma (ramsey) dead. when larry brings up that he wants his wife dead, owen knows what he must do for him, in order for a favor in return, for larry to kill his mother. devito is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has daydreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors through her head. he has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer. ramesy was actually nominated for an academy award for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old mrs. lift. along with having comedy, the film also has heart. one scene between devito and crystal starts off seemingly as a joke, but goes deeper, actually making me slightly sad. danny devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction. for any fan of comedies i recommend this.<br /><br />my rating: b plus. 84 mins. pg-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
