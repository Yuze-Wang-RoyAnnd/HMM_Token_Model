i really liked this movie, it totally reminds me of my high school days. the soundtrack is awesome. i am a huge nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie that he is in. i love the storyline, it is a total love story, against the odds kind of thing. i think anyone who graduated in the early eighties (1980-1984) should see the movie. it totally brought back memories of high school for me.
