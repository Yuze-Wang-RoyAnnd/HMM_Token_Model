what makes this one better than most "movie movies" is that it doesn't feel phony. the film the story of the hot-headed director and his rise and fall and rise, by using real recognizable names and events during the silent and early sound eras. instead of the generic "sound will put us out of business" business, they actually show jolson and "the jazz singer". the acting is really quite good, with believeable performances from don ameche, alice faye and j. edward bromberg in particular.
