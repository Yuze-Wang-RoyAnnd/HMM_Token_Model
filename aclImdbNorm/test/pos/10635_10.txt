michael haneke is known for his disturbing movies like "funny games". this time he adopted elfriede jelineks "die klavierspielerin", which is probably her best work so far. jelinek always writes about abusive behaviour in families, and especially of the suppression of women in a patriarchal society.<br /><br />erika kohut (isabelle huppert) works as a piano teacher at the viennese consevatory. she still lives with her mother (annie giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (already a hint of something strange). erika bullies her students the same way she's bullied by her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. a student, walter (benoit magimel), falls in love with her, but she refuses to simply sleep with him. she wants to play her games with him, but he's disgusted. he reluctantly follows her rules, which means disaster for both of them.<br /><br />haneke has a very clear picture language, everything is filmed in a almost spartanic way, so the complex characters and story are enhanced.<br /><br />people who don't know austria very well may be don't realize how essential the setting is for the story. jelinek (as well as other great austrian writers like thomas bernhard) suffers from the coldness and casualness in austrian families and society. austrians (at least viennese people) are often unable to articulate their pains, wishes, they suppress their emotions, so there often enough is no real love, affection and nearness in their families. in a society, where it's more important to show a perfect facade to society (even if this means to protect crimes within families as erika and her mother protect walters rape of erika to avoid a scandal) than to deal with your emotional problems it's probably no wonder that sigmund freud founded the psychoanalysis in vienna. erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, they only time they share some emotions is very violent and not at all loving. erika replaces her hidden emotions with wishes for violence, so that she can finally release some feelings. but she has nobody who really wants to speak about her emotions so in the end she has to stab herself to ease her inner pain.<br /><br />isabelle huppert shows her best performance of her career (as well of most other actresses). with a unsmiling face you often see only a hint of emotion in her face, a quick smile, a glance with her eyes. and in the end her pain is masterly displayed without a single tear. <br /><br />benoit magimel and annie giradot also turn in powerful performances, but the movie belongs to huppert.
