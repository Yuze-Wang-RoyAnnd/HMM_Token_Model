i've heard a few comments, particularly from prisoners of war, that changi is not historically accurate, and that it is disappointing. perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff, and much worse. but for the rest of us, who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the japanese during world war ii, changi is a remarkable introduction. but changi isn't a war documentary - if it had have been, then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount. it is a miniseries drama, with fictional characters and fictional situations (though based loosely on actual events i've heard and read about) - and at the centre of the story is the ideal of mateship. this group of young australian soldiers, taken prisoner by the japanese and held in appalling conditions for years, became mates through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war. it is also a cultural study of the differences between the japanese of the time and the western world, with its music, games and entertainment: in part 5, when it is becoming clear that japan will lose the war after germany has surrendered in europe, the japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners - in order to defeat a people, one must defeat their culture - and to do this, one must understand it. all in all, australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries, and is an unrivalled world leader in this regard: vyeing for the afi award with changi is my brother jack, the adaptation of george johnston's novel, and also a worthy winner. miniseries in recent years include day of the roses (the story of the investigation into the glanville train crash), kings in grass castles (the adaptation of mary durack's historical account of her pioneering ancestors), kangaroo palace (about a group of friends from a country town in australia who travel to london and change and grow apart), and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of bryce courtenay's powerful novel, the potato factory. less recently: nancy cato's sweeping saga of life on the murray - all the rivers run; cusack & james' brilliant novel about postwar life in sydney - come in spinner; colleen mccullough's outstanding pioneering saga - the thorn birds; the river kings; ruth park's novel the harp in the south; bodyline; eureka stockade; anzacs; etc..., etc... (of course, there have been some not-so-good productions - for instance, moby dick, do or die, on the beach, thorn birds: the missing years; etc...) generally, though, if an australian miniseries comes your way, make sure you see it - and this goes double for changi, a superbly directed masterpiece. rating: 9/10.
