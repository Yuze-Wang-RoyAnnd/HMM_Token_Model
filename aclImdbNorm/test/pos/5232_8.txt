my giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature-length films from 1930. by the standards of films made just a few years later, this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7--mostly because the sound quality was so poor. now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a degraded print (it did have a lot of lines and scratches), but i assume the sound problem was always an issue. that's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible--with background characters often drowning out the leads, characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality (such as what was seen in the bishop murder case, hell's angels and other films of the day). this was all made much worse in the big trail because most of the film was shot outside--something unheard of at the time. quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians! so, while the film was very hard to listen to, i realize that they had to start somewhere, so i can forgive this--especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking--a major innovation for 1930.<br /><br />the plot is rather similar to cimarron--a western that came out the following year and which captured the oscar for best picture. unfortunately, cimarron isn't all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film. while some might balk at the big trail's slow-moving pace, i saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling west on wagon trains. plus, the whole thing just looked so beautiful, as director raoul walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and the big trail looks almost like a film version of some ansel adams prints.<br /><br />as for the acting, it was pretty good. this was a major break for young john wayne--as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and unremarkable. here, he was given the lead and did a dandy job--though he was obviously young and a little less "john wayne-ish" than he was in later films, as his screen persona was not yet firmly established. another interesting part was played by tyrone power ii (tyrone power's father). he looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like bluto from the popeye cartoons! he made very few sound films--dying just a year after making this film--so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor.<br /><br />overall, the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there. for 1930, it was a remarkable achievement--more so than the much more famous and award-winning cimarron made the following year. much of the reason the big trail didn't win an oscar most likely was because all quiet on the western front came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films.
