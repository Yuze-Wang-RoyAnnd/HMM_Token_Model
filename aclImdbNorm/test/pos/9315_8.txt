i've heard a lot about porno holocaust and its twin film erotic nights of the living dead. both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film (and taking them off). if you are expecting the d'amato genius displayed in films like buio omega or death smiles on murder, you won't find it here. nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist. where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie/monster and his enormous penis that strangles and chokes women to death? only from d'amato. there is some amount of gore in which many of the men are bludgeoned to death. the film is set on a beautiful tropical island. as far as i know there is no subtitled version, so if you don't speak italian you wont know what is going on...but who cares right? in all honesty, gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex. and if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only, will for sure be offended instantly. i can just imagine modern day porn fans tracing back through d'amato's output and coming across this atrocity! out of the two i find erotic nights of the living dead far superior. but, don't bother watching either if they are cut. porno holocaust is extremely low budget as expected. even the monster looks no where as good as george eastman's character in anthropophagus. the film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your d'amato film quest.
