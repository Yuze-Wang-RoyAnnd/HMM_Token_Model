this movie is based on a play, and is the second adaptation of this work. paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago. they have all met for a reunion. terry kinney plays james, a junior high principal, and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role. vincent d'onofrio, as phil, plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of "money" cockiness. tony shalhoub is george, the current mayor of the town, and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown. gary sinise plays tom, a writer, turned alcoholic, and in my opinion, is excellent in the role. while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship, conflicts, jealousy, and fighting abound. as the men come to terms with what was, and is now, they are forced to look at their lives in a non-pleasant way. it's unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been, and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other. it's not the best movie i've seen, but it's certainly good enough for a viewing.
