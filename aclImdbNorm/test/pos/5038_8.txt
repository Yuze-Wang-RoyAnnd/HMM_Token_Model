i really enjoyed this movie for what it is: a funny little film that doesn't take itself too seriously. plot summaries are available everywhere so i won't go into details. michael isn't about a complex plot anyway. it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip.<br /><br />john travolta's performance as a chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-brawling, pie-eating angel is just perfect. and who doesn't love sparky?<br /><br />watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time. highly recommended.
