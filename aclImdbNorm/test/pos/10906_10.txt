joan cusack steals the show! the premise is good, the plot line interesting and the screenplay was ok. a tad too simplistic in that a coming-out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite-so-positive. then again, it is fiction. :) all in all an entertaining romp.<br /><br />one thing i noticed was the "inside-joke" aspect. since the target-audience probably was straight, they may not get the gay "stuff" in context with the story. <br /><br />kevin kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes don't take in consideration when suggesting kline for a part.<br /><br />this one hit the mark.
