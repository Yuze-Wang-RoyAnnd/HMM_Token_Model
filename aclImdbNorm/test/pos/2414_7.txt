<br /><br />i first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995, i dismissed it offhand, saying that julie was no daniel, never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid.<br /><br />but here it is, 5 years later, its on disney and im watching it again. and i'm finding that it isnt as bad as i made it out to be. miyagi is still miyagi, just as kool as ever, the musical score is still there pleasant as ever. and swank's character isnt that bad, her acting is pretty good considering the script. it beats the third installment by a wide margin. so, my original rating of 4 has been raised to 7.
