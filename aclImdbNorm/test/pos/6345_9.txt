let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original "lonesome dove" than i. both the pulitzer prize-winning book and the towering mini-series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving, dramatic, believable, and engrossing works. there is no comparison between "lonesome dove" and any western film- at least not since the legendary collaborations of john ford and john wayne. it was with real reservations that i sat down to watch this new mini-series, what with mcmurtry's non-participation, and the missing original cast members. after watching the first episode it was clear that this is no "lonesome dove". in almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original. but so what? i wasn't expecting it to measure up. taken as an effort of it's own this film is engaging, entertaining and of a very good quality. if it were done as a new story, not as a sequel to "lonesome dove", there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. jon voight did a creditable job as call, barbara hershey was a terrific clara, and the new characters like gideon walker and agostina vega were well rendered and believable. louis gossett jr. deserves special mention as the horse wrangler isom pickett. the film made me care about the characters, and i don't ask any more than that from an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it's predecessor- it is worth viewing in it's own right.
