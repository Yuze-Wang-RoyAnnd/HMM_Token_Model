i would say 'bride of chucky' is a "return to greatness" but the series was never really great. very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. and it contains the best subtitle/tagline: "chucky gets lucky." so he does, in the role of jennifer tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for 'star trek: voyager.' tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for chucky. and as much as i liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + pinhead) and chucky lines were great ("in fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice," among others.) mercifully, chucky and the series has given up on andy the "hide the soul" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. he teams up with his ex (tilly) whom he transfers into a "bride" doll and a couple of bonnie & clyde teens (really, heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with chucky's human corpse. this is for any chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'child's play' films. it's funny, dark, harmless, gory
