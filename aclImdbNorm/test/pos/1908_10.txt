yeah...i read david lee roth's autobiography, "crazy from the heat," (which by the way is an amazing read), and dlr says this was his favorite blacksploitation movie as a kid. in fact, he says he always imagined himself as a black guy in southern cal. mr roth is quoted as saying:<br /><br />"we saw every blacksploitation picture, and those movies were a huge influence on me. trouble man, superfly, foxy brown, shaft, cleopatra jones, blacula, rudy ray moore doin' his dolemite vibe-i saw all of those..."<br /><br />he goes on to say:<br /><br />"dolemite - rudy ray moore - was one of the originals. he was a blue comic, doing blue humor. like redd foxx did on early party records. so he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent. his answer was not "bonds. james bond." his answer was "dolemite, motherf*****!" we would wait for that line in all of his movies. "get whitey" would show up in every single movie at least once, and we would wait for that, too. they had the cars. they had the shoes. they had the guns. the haircuts. the slang. and the scams. and we all knew that all those beatific resolves at the end of the movie were white bull****. he's trying to feed hungry children but he's actually a pimp...bull****. that was designed to make it palatable to our moms and dads so they'd let us go see the picture."<br /><br />spoken like a true genius. so upon reading about dolemite in mr. roth's book i immediately bought in on dvd and i really like it. yeah, it's super low-budget, and yeah...i hate rap...but as a fan of tarantino movies, i can see many similarities, especially some of the 70's fusion/funk ala-jaco pastorius music throughout the film. i also love the scene where the two cops 'bust' him for coke and then one of them snorts a whole bunch of it like he'd done it a thousand times before, and says something like, "aww yeah....that's the real mccoy!"...and then he continues to talk and has a little bit of coke still on his lip. classic! some of the violence is a little over the edge, but shocking, which i would consider to be a positive quality. not as predictable as i assumed it would be. definitely going to pick up "the human tornado" very soon. 10 out of 10.
