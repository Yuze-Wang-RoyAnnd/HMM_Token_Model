going into this movie i knew two things about it. i knew that it was a real extreme flick, and i knew that it was somewhat artsy. both appeal to me in their own right, but when placed together it can be something truly unique. and this was damn right, without a doubt, unique. like i said above, it is an artsy film. the way they used some intense sound, it reminded me a lot of an aronofsky film. visually i haven't seen anything like it. the cinematography and lighting were done very well. the movie seriously uses visuals and sounds better than anything i've seen in a while. especially when you consider the experience these young filmmakers had (couple 20 year olds), you really have to take your hat off to them.<br /><br />the movie isn't easy to describe or even discuss. there isn't an actual story
