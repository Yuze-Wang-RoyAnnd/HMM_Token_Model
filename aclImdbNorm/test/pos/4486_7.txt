i guess by the time i saw this episode, i had seen enough twilight zones to have it figured out ahead of time. there is this odd assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. they are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. it is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. there is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts, but no one can remember anything. they represent different jobs: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. why are they there? it leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end, but i guess i had a pretty good idea before it all happened.
