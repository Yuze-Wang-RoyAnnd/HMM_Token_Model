the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. sharing everything, trusting each other completely.<br /><br />i like the gilmore girls but i am not sure why. the mother, named lorelai (lauren graham), and the daughter, named rory (short for lorelai, played by alexis bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. there are some funny supporting characters, such as luke (scott patterson). he and lorelai like each, may be even love each other, but neither of them really acts on it. they have their little moments. there are some other supporting characters, most of them very funny, and with their won touching moments.<br /><br />what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult. the dialogue between them is quick, sharp, funny and sometimes touching as well. the band they have is beautiful. the gilmore girls makes you feel good so try it.
