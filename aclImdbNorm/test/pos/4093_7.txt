i have to offset all the terrible comments. i love this movie. i own the movie and the soundtrack. i watch it whenever i need a pick me up. granted it's not like the sound of music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. i adored the late (and great) bobby vann, and james shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. i saw this when it first came out in the theaters. i'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in "the boyfriend". it's a modern musical and shouldn't be judged by all that went before. it's just the best for dreamers like me, who wish they could find this place - no illness, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. this is nothing more than a feel good movie. that is what all movies should be about. shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie. if the acting isn't the greatest-who cares. i love the idea of the movie. peter finch, a very stiff actor, liv ullmann, gorgeous as ever, sally kellerman, surprisingly good voice, michael york, typical, and olivia hussey, stunning, all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people. not one of them acted like actors in a movie. they acted like real people, the same way i would act if i found this place. torn between going home and staying there, in awe of everything. yes, there are flaws in this movie, but get over it, it's not citizen kane, it's a feel good musical!
