feels like an impressionistic film; if there is such a thing.<br /><br />the story is well told, very poetic. the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters (or interpreted by the actors :)).<br /><br />the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well, unless you hate such emotion in movies - not so in my case.<br /><br />it's a very humanistic film.<br /><br />the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right.<br /><br />well done.<br /><br />a good classic for any good film collection.
