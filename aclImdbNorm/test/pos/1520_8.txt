closet land is not at happy movie. neither is it connected to any kind of social realism. this is perhaps its strength. the distance from specific time and nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful and rips away the burden of nationalism and propaganda you often sense in movies made to criticize nations in opposit of ones own (i am of course primarily speaking of the usa propaganda in some commercial film).<br /><br />bit closet land is so much more than a message. it is a film of pure, surrealistic beauty, filled with the same clean, clinical form you find in work such as 1984 and it's equals.<br /><br />i am of old a big fan of alan rickman, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, i might add, the uncomparable sex-appeal ;-)). the outplay between him and madeleine stowe is brilliant. everytime i see him, he seems to play a character even nastier than the last one...<br /><br />but, enough sweettalk. the film lacks in action. i dont want any crashing cars, but i want something to happen, except pure talk. after an hour i got really tired of the interrogationroom, the predictable actions and more than anything i wanted a more complex view of it all, the world, the former lives of the characters and all the rest of the framework that was missing. for some people a nice touch. for me something less positive.<br /><br />anyway, closet land is a movie worth it's time if you are ready to make a trip into the abyss of the human nature.<br /><br />and of course for us who really loves the always evil alan rickman.
