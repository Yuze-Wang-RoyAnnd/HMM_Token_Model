well i just discovered imdb from my twin sister, carol. carol and i played the "fat identical twin" in midnight madness. we didn't have to prepare much for the fat part, that came with us, and well and the rest was natural. ;) it was our first major film role and we had a blast making it. we were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from the disney studio in burbank and the hollywood, california area. we grew up in front of the tv and probably some of the first generation of latch-key-kids. twenty years later, we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or what ever is politically correct these days. we don't pursue acting any more but have been know to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives. carol is a chiropractor in our home town of southern california and i am in the information technology field in georgia.<br /><br />i maybe bias, but i thought the film was cute, clean and fun. we knew it wasn't a master piece or an oscar nominee, however, it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together. it's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts. and no one was more exited when it was released on video as carol and i were. carol found it at kmart for $6.99! now that's an inexpensive way to capture one's memories and share it with others.<br /><br />sincerely, betsy lynn and carol gwynn; the thompson twins
