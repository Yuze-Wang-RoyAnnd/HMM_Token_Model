"porgy & bess" was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see. even at the tender age of 5 years, i was so greatly moved by the drama that i cried aloud at the screen "crown, please don't take bess!" i was fortunate enough to see the one tv broadcast of "porgy & bess" so many years ago and now all i have are the great memories (and the record album) to remember this wonderful, wonderful movie. i have been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day i might own a copy of "porgy & bess" - but it doesn't look like it will happen. what is the hold up? obviously, there is enough public interest in this movie to warrant a release. after all these years, i remember it and it sure seems like i'm not alone. this movie is brimming with human emotion - jealousy, lust, anger, bravery, determination. "porgy & bess" is a buried gem that deserves to be brought forth into the light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to relish.
