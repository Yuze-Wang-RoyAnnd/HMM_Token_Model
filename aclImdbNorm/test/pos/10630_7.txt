first of all, those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film. even those, like me, who are desensitized to most graphically violent and sexual acts in movies should beware. i'm not telling you to steer away from the film, but be aware that what you're about to see is some disturbing material. definitely not a pleasing film to watch, but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value. but i must admit, when i watched the film for a second time, i had to skip to the next chapter when the "razor blade scene" came up. <br /><br />the main character is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters i can think of, but we start to better realize the humanity of her character later in the film's second act. in one scene, she stuffs broken glass in one of her student's jacket pocket after being dissatisfied with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience. the student goes into her pocket and cries out with pain as she stares at her blood-stained hand. next to the razor blade scene, that disturbed me most. the student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she. when she gets word that her daughter won't be able to play, she talks about it like she also got also her hand injured, being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter into becoming an overachiever. <br /><br />though the film intrigued me and caught my interest for the most part, i felt more needed to be explained about isabelle huppert's character. when a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porno movies and engaging in that behavior herself, you want to understand the root of the problem. the movie establishes that she wants desperately to be loved. then why the hateful attitude towards everyone? why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain? <br /><br />the acting is terrific and i liked the glossy, stylized lighting. altogether, it's not a film i'd recommend if you're in the mood to be entertained, but as i said it's very intriguing. and i'm sure if i watched it a few more times, i'd be able to spot certain subtleties that'll shed more light on aspects of the film i didn't realize initially. <br /><br />my score: 7 (out of 10)
