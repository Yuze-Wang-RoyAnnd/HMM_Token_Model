everything about "choose connor" was top=drawer, especially the script and the very proficient work done by the 21-year-old director, writer, producer luke eberl . . . a talented young man from whom to expect great things. all the acting was credible, the dialogue smart, the theme important. loved it!!!<br /><br />saw it at the 2007 woodstock film festival, where it was screened twice and went over tremendously with the audiences. it's more than just a coming of age movie -- this kid learns a hard, heartbreaking lesson about trust, politics and "the system" -- how things really work to suit the personal agendas of those in powerful positions.<br /><br />i would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain.
