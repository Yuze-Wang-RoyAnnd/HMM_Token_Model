i was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by joshua leonard before its premiere at the 2005 sundance festival. in twelve brief but exquisite minutes, leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. the film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a heart- rending story. kelli garner and lucas haas radiate as the two lovers. and, in his first venture into dramatic narrative, leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. i feel this short should be expanded into a feature film. it's difficult to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know it when you see it!
