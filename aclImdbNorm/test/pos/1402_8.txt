this is a very odd movie for harold lloyd--at least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s. instead of a nice guy, he and snib pollard are con men--out to rob everyone blind. in a particularly successful con, chester pretends to have lost a "very valuable ring" and a bit later, harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring. the ring, of course, is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold, but the greed of the stooge is so great, he "convinces" harold to say nothing and sell him the "valuable" ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck(?). again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman (working with a guy doing fake s'eances). she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stole--and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money.<br /><br />as luck would have it, the two con men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. soon, the lady returns and messes with their minds--releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways.<br /><br />all around, this is a completely odd and contrived film, but it is also exceedingly funny, as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team. plus, while creepy and strange, i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady.
