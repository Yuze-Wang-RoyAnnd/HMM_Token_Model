i absolutely loved this film... so much emotion in such a small amount of time. i loved the beginning and how it completely throws you off guard. i love the story and the deer being brought in. i know that when i think of deer i think of innocence, and prosperity. also, in psalm 42:2 in the bible it says, "as the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for you, o god". which could even connect the last moment when the woman says it will be okay. as if she knows she's going with god. perhaps i am thinking way to much into it. but sometimes it is interesting to see what goes on through peoples' minds. thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. i live in texas and i had it playing on cable... i immediately got onto the computer to find out more about this film and this amazing director! i really liked the music that was used in the background. music can sometimes make or break a film. it definitely set the mood perfectly. very nice choice!<br /><br />thanks again.<br /><br />laetitia
