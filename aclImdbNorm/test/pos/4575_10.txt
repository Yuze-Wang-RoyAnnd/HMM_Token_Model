i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. i've thought about it frequently ever since. after two dvd viewings i'm glad to say it held up perfectly. like any great comedy, i laughed more on each viewing, both in anticipation of gags, but also after catching things missed before. <br /><br />mike judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense. in office space, the environment make the characters believable. idiocracy's future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work. i'll be waiting to see if they release a better dvd with some actual features before buying it. but this movie deserves the support on dvd not offered to it at the theater.
