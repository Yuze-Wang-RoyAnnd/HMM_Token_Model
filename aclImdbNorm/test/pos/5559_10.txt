growing up in the late 60s and 70s i could not help but become a fan of science fiction. with america's space program in top gear, sci-fi books, movies, tv shows, and comic books fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. farscape is so unlike any other sci-fi show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like star trek, battlestar gallatica, x-files, and deep space nine personal favorites. one of the criticisms of farscape is that the casual viewer can't just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is going on. there have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story arcs and complicated characters. this for me is one of the charms of the show. i don't need or want to have the story all tied up neatly at the end of every episode like the various incarnations of star trek have done. all in all, farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running storyline that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities.<br /><br />unfortunately, the shortsighted people at the sci-fi channel have canceled farscape's 5th season. they have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings. yet just a few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite. it's a shame that all of the artists who help create this show will be unable to continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the very channel/company that made it all possible in the first place.<br /><br />hey, don't take my word for it, watch the show, watch the re-runs and make up your own mind. help save farscape!
