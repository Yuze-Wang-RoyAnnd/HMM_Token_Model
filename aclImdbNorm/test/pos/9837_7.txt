years ago, i didn't love and respect the films of jimmy cagney nearly as much as i do now. i noticed that many of cagney's films done with warner brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. however, the more i watched these films, the more i found i was hooked despite these aspects. in fact, i now kind of like and expect them! fans of old time hollywood films probably understand what i am saying--teens and other young whippersnappers don't! well, when it comes to entertainment, the mayor of hell never lets up from start to finish. while the idea of a shady character like cagney played taking over running a reform school is ridiculous, and while all the changes he made also seemed far-fetched, it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment.<br /><br />the gang of tough thugs were pre-dead end kids and instead of the likes of leo gorcey, huntz hall and billy hallop, similar roles are played here by frankie darrow and farina. yes, i did say "farina". this black actor was already famous for his roles in the our gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid child actors in hollywood. all he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical "negro". here, he actually was pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual. however, some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving farina and his dad, fred 'snowflake' toones. with awful names like "farina" and "snowflake", don't say i didn't warn you.<br /><br />apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. the kids do a great job, as does cagney and dudley digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden. also, as an added plus, you get to see perennial warner stock actor allen jenkins in his first role for the studio.
