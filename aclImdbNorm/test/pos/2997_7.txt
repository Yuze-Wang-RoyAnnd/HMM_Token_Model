i caught this flick on the trail end of a tape i had used to capture a movie i truly wanted to wanted to see again. when i saw raquel welch's name in the opening credits, i decided to watch it. it was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back "in the wayback machine" to the farcical movies that hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current austin powers stuff. oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching. there was some delightful scenery, although ms. welch provided the most pleasant of such. tape it if you get the chance and watch it when you have absolutely nothing else to do. it is not a snoozer, but it won't have you rolling in the aisles wanting more, either.
