a brilliant and sensitive movie with interwoven plot lines. as a general warning, the movie turns quite dark about half way through. as sudden as it is, this is a change that i found fitting to the themes of the movie, particularly the comparison of the ishkanani to the filthy rich, and (as is said by finn at the end) how each person makes up the tribe, and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person.<br /><br />anton yelchin (finn earl) is spectacular in this movie. he is probably best known as chekov from star trek or kyle reese in terminator salvation, but he's been in a whole plethora of movies you've probably never heard of (alpha dog, which is another brilliant performance on yelchin's part, house of d, hearts in atlantis, to name a few...) the point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own. other excellent performances from diane lane and donald sutherland are what takes this movie up a notch, from great to excellent.
