a scarily real drama, there isn't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has, the characters are not your typical islamic terrorist, you have a blonde haired, blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks, he is a converted muslim. a well respected business man, who pretends to be jewish and a frenchman who has converted to islam, but has clearly taken the word of the koran to a whole new level. the hero of the plot is darwyn, who is an undercover fbi agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell, and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected. the first episode is a small taste of what's to follow. although it is about islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all muslims are extremists, which is comforting to those concerned with racism, considering half the terrorist cell are islam converts, it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of. the most chilling drama i've ever seen. the reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends, your husband or your neighbours really are. terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.
