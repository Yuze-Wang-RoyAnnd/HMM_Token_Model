i so much enjoyed this little musical fantasy i bought a copy to share with my friends. it is a pleasant and diverting change from our mundane lives..... i believe that we can all benefit from an active fantasy life, one of joy and indulgence, i heartily recommend it!<br /><br />the performance is excellent, and the music uplifting!
