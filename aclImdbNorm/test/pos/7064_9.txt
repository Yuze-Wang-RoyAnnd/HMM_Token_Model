meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years! we saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since. bill murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and befriends him, while leading his cit's into once mischievous scheme after another! the cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. this is not another sleazy, dumb, teen sex-fest. it is funny and sweet and just all-around fun. anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. it is a must-see. watch out for spaz - he is by far the best character! (especially during the camp social - while bill murray hams it up for the camera - just watch spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with!) by far, one of my very favorite comedies of all time!
