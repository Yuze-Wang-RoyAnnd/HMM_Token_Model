it's all about getting what you want when you want it. and the message of bluebeard's eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for, until what you wish for wishes for you.<br /><br />most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue. misogynistic pirates aside, cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert. through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction.<br /><br />the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not accustomed to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either cooper or colbert. the whole reason i watched the film was because they are "likable" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people, or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. <br /><br />if you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film...and satisfaction, as we said, is what it's all about. such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a...ummm...blue moon.
