this was really a pleasure to see; the dialogue was - for the most part - absolutely outstanding (i thought the women's roles were a little better written, which is a nice surprise). the performances were uniformly very good, too. frank gorshin overdoes it a little when he goes into his various cons, but this might be his overcompensating for what i see as weaknesses in how the character is written; he's very good otherwise. harry groener does similarly well with a slightly underwritten character (tony), overdoing some of the character's angrier scenes slightly. ursula burton is excellent as sister theresa, really carrying the film through some of its weaknesses. seymour cassel and louise fletcher are a little underused here, though i liked their work as always. shirley jones, wendie malick, jill eikenberry and faye grant are very good also (i couldn't help thinking grant reminded me a little of catherine o'hara here); cloris leachman rather tears into her role, with reasonably good results.<br /><br />i wish there had been more of a sure hand behind the camera, though. sometimes the framing or staging seemed a bit off, or awkward. the closeups seemed overused (or erratically used) to me. and we don't always go from scene to scene as smoothly as we'd like. some of the "tough guy" approach to the federal agent (music, costuming) was too over the top for me as well. and the few fantasy sequences didn't really work. but there are things that were very well done; the opening sequence set in buffalo around 1970, for example. and, frankly, all of the scenes regarding theresa's church work (i suspect the writer and actress liked the character a lot, which helps). the scenes between malick and eikenberry are very good.<br /><br />the plot is probably a bit overcontrived - there seem to be a few too many schemes going on at once to keep them all straight at times, and the coincidences got to be a little too much. and i was a little bothered by the ending (should we really be rooting for their biggest con yet to succeed?), but the ride along the way is very enjoyable. it would be nice to see more independent movies like this one made.<br /><br />7 of 10
