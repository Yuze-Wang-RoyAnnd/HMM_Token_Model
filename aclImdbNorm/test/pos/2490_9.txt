it's said that this film is or was banned in the us since it was released. since there is no information on imdb i must rely on my other sources and believe it. if this is really true, the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway.<br /><br />the movie is a so-called mockumentary, although i think the topic is too serious call it like that. it creates a scenario where america is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. after an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park. in that, they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an american flag, posted 50 miles ahead, while they're are followed by police and army troops.<br /><br />the movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the tribunals and the hunting through the desert, filmed by european film crews. all the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. people stare directly into the camera, shouting at it. it seems very, very real. talking about realism here is nonsense. this movie is not about how to make a realistic film, it is about how such a film would look like, if it was real. and it certainly would look like this. if it would be filmed anyway. in an 'utopian' state like this, there surely wouldn't be a european film crew allowed to film those things.<br /><br />there are many things that frighten us. the defendants are people from all social classes. political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophists, unemployed, etc. they seem to be hopeless, rebellious or scared. they are no heroes. they talk a lot in the tribunal, knowing it doesn't lead to anything, saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before. one says he's not afraid to die. is this true? well, he doesn't have to run through the desert hunted by cops. the defendants have no chance, or at least, their only chance, the decision between prison and punishment park, is no chance really. the way they decide in the end and the way film ends, makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide.<br /><br />these tribunals remind us a lot of tribunals in the third reich. the officials use the same kind of idealistic speeching, ignoring all the arguments from the defendants, starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet. they warn the defendants of "watching their language" and insult them much more. they ask them questions, the defendants can not answer, but it's never intendend they should. these scenes are a statement about what we call justice.<br /><br />the scenes in the desert are on a different level. when we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize that they realize, they haven't got a chance. seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and the thirst, they don't have a clue how they should stand this free days. the film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness. they argue, should they play the game, or escape, or revolt? it all leads to the same and no one is surprised. some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state? why not? it empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they want to. it is not a gas chamber, but the nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built. the comparison is fair, since they is no real difference.<br /><br />the movie is scary and depressing. the problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore. these is not science-fiction. talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopic. the film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us, is not only useless, but dangerous. it also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution. the defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight this. they do things, but for nothing. even is this delivers no solution to us, it still is a statement.<br /><br />to me, the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie. here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom, moral and peace. it accuses the government, a fictional goverment nevertheless, to be dangerous and inhuman. and such a film is banned. think about it when you see the american flag the next time.
