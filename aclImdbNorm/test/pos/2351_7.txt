"hollywood cavalcade" is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th century fox roster, don ameche and alice faye, and containing a couple of in jokes.<br /><br />the film concerns a max sennett type, michael connors (ameche) who brings an actress to hollywood, molly adair (faye) and makes her a big silent comedienne, eventually moving her into more dramatic roles. he becomes extremely successful with her as his star. obsessed with his work, he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man (alan curtis) run off and get married. he's so shocked, he dumps her. she and her husband go off and continue to be more and more popular while connors' studio starts losing money at an alarming rate. before you know it, he's through. molly wants to help and asks that connors direct her next film.<br /><br />there's lots of keystone kop type footage, which is quite funny, and some fantastic slapstick by buster keaton, who is wonderful. the film also has a scene from "the jazz singer" when the talkies take over. the in-joke, of course, has to do with rin tin-tin, for whom zanuck used to write. in one scene, rinny's trainer brings him in as a potential contract player for connors' studio. connors throws both of them out of his office. a few scenes later, rin-tin-tin is shown to be #1 box office. the role of the famous german shepherd in this film is played by rin tin-tin, jr., daddy having passed away in jean harlow's arms in 1932, one month shy of his 14th birthday. fortune smiled on him even at the end.<br /><br />alice faye is very pretty and does a fine job, as does ameche, who turns in an energetic performance. j. edward bromberg and stuart erwin provide very good support.<br /><br />unfortunately, this film isn't quite sure what it is - history, comedy, romance, or drama. however, "hollywood cavalcade" is still quite watchable.
