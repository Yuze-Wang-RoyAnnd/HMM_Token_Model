it is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of "acting adult" is not engaging in sensuality. instead, these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema. the production values are good, especially sweeping shots of montana and florida. the soundtrack by jimmy buffet is a perfect fit. the young actors are spirited and refreshing.<br /><br />the plot, about a trio of kids who work together to save some burrowing owls from death at the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house empire builder, will engage kids. so many films make children appear powerless, it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference. and even though parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right injustices.<br /><br />if you are tired of all of the self-indulgent story lines about children that fill the cinema, give hoot a shot. then take some time to talk to your kids about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world they live in. a positive message from a positive film.
