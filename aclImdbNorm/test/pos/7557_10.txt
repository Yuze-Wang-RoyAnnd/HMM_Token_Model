...that maybe someday people will wake up to. people who can resist the urge to separate each and everything, and who see the 60s for what they were. people who can see that it was the individuals who made those times; not the other way around.<br /><br />the "forrest gump" comparison is a good one. both films look at the 60s, but "four friends" is about human beings, as opposed to caricatures. ff delves deeply into the very thing that fg (quite successfully!) tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. but while "gump" files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box, "four friends" picks up and embraces each toy, thus blurring the lines between what you hold dearly and what you are.<br /><br />if you associate romance with shoe polish, you'll hate this film.
