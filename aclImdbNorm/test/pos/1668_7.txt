after seeing naked city and night and the city (which is still my favorite dassin) i was more than excited to watch his "masterpiece" (o-word criterion) rififi.<br /><br />now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.<br /><br />so i have at least these five questions in my mind:<br /><br />1. in the final countdown louis grutter shot from the inside a house the main character tony le st'ephanois. he couldn't know if he is still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. so of course tony wasn't dead and shot him. big questionmark.<br /><br />2. in another important scene the specialist in safes cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring (which was a part of the robbery) a woman which was working for louis grutter in a night bar. stupid, because before this character wasn't that stupid. and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery. small questionmark.<br /><br />3.after the gangsters behind louis grutter murder mario ferrati and his wife,tony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang. at the same time they don't care for the security of joe's wife and his five years old child. of course louis gang kidnapped the son. cheap and simple.<br /><br />4. the perfect heist: of course this is the best 30min. long scene in the whole plot, without any word spoken in the whole time, but was this a perfect heist?? comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fire-extinguisher to banned the alarm. also too simple.<br /><br />5. the grutter gang went to the house of mario, because they knew (however....) the jewels will be there. then they murder mario and his wife. and then? they are not searching for it! no. they ran directly out of the apartment. and more. they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while (which was the same day) inside to take the jewels. big questionmark.<br /><br />over all: it's a good movie. because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene. because of the very good cut (the end scene in the car through paris is stunning) . because of a very good actor called jean servais. because of this black/white fever you will get while watching it. because of some other reasons too other user wrote about, but please don't tell me this is a stunning story.
