don't listen to what the critics have always said about this cute, charming little movie. madonna is great in this clever comedy. i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers- no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it. everyone always enjoyed it. it's actually a great movie for kids, too.
