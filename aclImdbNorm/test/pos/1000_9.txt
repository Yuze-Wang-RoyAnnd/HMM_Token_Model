i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film. while i am not at all a fan of british drama, i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made. i was in tears by the end of the film. every scene was mesmerizing. the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive.<br /><br />i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.<br /><br />*******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance! ****end spoiler*****<br /><br />keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy.<br /><br />i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.
