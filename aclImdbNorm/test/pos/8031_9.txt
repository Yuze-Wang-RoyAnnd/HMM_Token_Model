throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the american c.i.a. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. in the beginning, their objectives were simple: spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. years have elapse and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying, discrediting u.s. citizens and infiltrating american organizations who criticize the u.s. government. this movie however, centers on the c.i.a.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'carlos, the jackel.' the film is called " the assignment " and tells the story lt. cmdr. annibal ramirez, (aidan quinn) a u.s. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. recruited by jack shaw (donald sutherland) of the c.i.a. and amos (ben kingsley), a special agent from the israeli mosad, ramirez is secretly trained to look, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real jackel working for the russians. this film is explosively exciting, and packed with wild chases, killings and inter-country mayhem. quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. easily one of his best efforts. ****
