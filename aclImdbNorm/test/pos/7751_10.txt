i have no words to really describe this series.<br /><br />the premise behind this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality which ends up whirling up a team of oddballs into her own rendering of the world, which after all was a creation of haruhi, since she wants a world with aliens, espers and time travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world ridden with repetitive anime series and non innovative tv shows.<br /><br />characters are well developed, and you will end up loving them, some less than others. the word to describe the animation job does not exist, since "excellent" would really fall short to describe how was done. there are many funny situations which either will make you smile or put you into deep thoughts. don't fall for the impression of the first episode, since that's only the tip of the iceberg, as the novels are yet to come.<br /><br />the only problem comes due to the lack of chronological order in the episodes, but you can solve that problem, no? <br /><br />conclusion: unquestionably, one of the best series of 2006.
