what an awesome mini-series. the original traffik completely stole me away from anything else that was on. far more engaging than the american remake, the original traffik boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to north american audiences. juliette binoche being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenaged daughter of a government official. but it's not star power that carries this film (though i enjoyed the american version, i felt it was dimmed by the famous americans in the picture). <br /><br />unfortunately, i saw the american version before i found the original bbc mini-series. of course there were no picture filters, lush locales, and the big name stars/director. however, the grit and grime of europe (through the drugworld) perfectly compliments the impending sense of danger, which permeates throughout this film. the problems, such as getting addicts off of drugs by giving them more, poor anti-drug campaigning, and the resistance of foreign governments to assist with destroying their drug cultivators from within, all make traffik bold, immersive, and horrific all at the same time!<br /><br />the truly incredible portions of the movie all come from pakistan. my god, i never knew how bad the problem really was over in europe...even all over! for a real education on the problems of drugs, beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the american version. each show one very clear and undeniable fact. those countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many. <br /><br />drugs are worse than war. they work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "successful" society.
