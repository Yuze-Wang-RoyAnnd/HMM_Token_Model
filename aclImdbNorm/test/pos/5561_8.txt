an astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien-outlaws. this incredible plotted and enjoyable tv-installment comes along as a positive birth-fantasy. the individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last. most of the action takes place inside the womb of moia, the living space-ship (who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). while science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasies (watch the 'alien'-movies for example, especially the fourth part 'resurrection') this comes as a surprise. also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. one of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences 'photogasms' while being exposed to sunlight. the crew even has to go to the toilet. wouldn't that be impossible in 'star trek'?
