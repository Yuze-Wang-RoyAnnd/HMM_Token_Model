its a good film set in vienna about a cab driver, toni (donald buka), who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot whilst sitting in the back of his cab. this gives him an identity as he is an illegal immigrant, but he needs to play out the role of the victim until he catches a flight to the u.s. with a ticket in the victim's name. mrs manelli (joan camden) rumbles him but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband, claude (francis lederer), a concert pianist. as a result, toni is let off the hook. claude does not want to part from his wife, but she runs away from him. there are several plot twists and eventually both toni and mrs manelli make a run for it together - they are both trying to escape from their lives in vienna. there is a tense, exciting build-up to the finale. are they going to get away.....??...<br /><br />unfortunately, the picture quality isn't fantastic and there is a line that runs down the middle of the picture for a while. the cast are all very good in their roles, especially francis lederer's portrayal of claude. also important to the story are heinth (manfred inger) as the cab company owner, marie (inge konradi) as toni's hometown girlfriend and the inspector (hermann erhardt). <br /><br />its a good film.
