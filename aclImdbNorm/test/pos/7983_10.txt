batman returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor, and i like it a lot. also, the scenery is more darker, and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented danny elfman.<br /><br />however, i didn't like the idea to make the penguin a monster, unlike to the comic books, where he's human. even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses a human dignity, and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. but still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.<br /><br />michael keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as the dark knight, and this time he's powerful as in the original batman. it's not difficult to understand why he's called batman in public sometimes...<br /><br />also, michelle pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role, and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat. really, the actors did all a masterful work with batman returns, which made it a successful movie.<br /><br />if you liked batman, watch its awesome sequel, cause it's very worthy for all the dark knight's hard-core lovers.<br /><br />steve baillargeon
