i never saw doctor who before (at least not in any focused way), so i was new to the concept. i have to say that the new show works very well. it's funny (it really also ought to say "comedy" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. the human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current tv shows.<br /><br />i've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far. even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up (with time-travel, saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff) works out amazingly well here.<br /><br />christopher eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light-hearted though occasionally morose doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him, i'll be quite surprised. but i'm willing to give the new guy a chance. there's little doubt, however, that the eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics.<br /><br />the relationship between the doctor and rose is particularly refreshing. the doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest, and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them, which however is much more emotional and human than sexual.<br /><br />a good show. the biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this ought to have better special effects. and why they don't simply use some cheaper effects, i don't know. in this day and age, sfx don't have to cost a bundle - just look at the star wars: revelations fan film.<br /><br />8 out of 10.
