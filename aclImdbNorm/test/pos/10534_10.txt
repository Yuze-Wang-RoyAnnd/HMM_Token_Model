the centurions is one of the best cartoons ever and it needs to be put on tv and dvd so people can have younger generations enjoy such a good show that is far better than the garbage they have made in the last 14 years. i have a petition online that is at the website address http://www.petitiononline.com/6600f/petition.html that originally was trying to get this show on five days a week but is now trying to get this show onto dvd since the tv station it was focused on has bad public relations. we all need to convince the people who own this show to put it on dvd so it can be seen by future generations. also since now hasbro toys owns the toy line of this show we might want to try to convince them to make a live action movie of it just like they have done with transformers and sometime this year g.i.joe. we need good cartoons like this one to come back and be enjoyed by the younger generations. please do sign this petition so we can one day have dvds of the guys who are famous for yelling "power extreme!"
