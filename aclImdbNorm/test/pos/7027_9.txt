dirty dancing follows the story of frances 'baby' houseman (jennifer grey)and her family as they spend the summer at kellerman's family summer camp. we get to see her discover herself as she falls in love with the dance instructor, johnny castle (patrick swayze).<br /><br />the movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!) some great music, and terrific scenery. it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending! you know how it's going to end from the beginning, but that's really not the point here. the point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.<br /><br />it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv...never mind the fact that i already have it memorized!
