i love it! i love pauly shore. it seems some people don't agree. it's humor, and he's not like everyone else. the movie is great. i love the story line and most of the people in the movie. it's funny from the first time she meets him at school. i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home. i like that tiffani theissan isn't a bad girl in the end. all the secrets are let out. only the people you want to see are left in the end. (except for those of you who don't like pauly shore.) even if you don't like him, there are funny parts, and her family tortures him through most of the movie. she's country girl gone wild and needs to be heard. she finally makes it. it's got just the right amount of love and romance. i give it an 8 out of 10.
