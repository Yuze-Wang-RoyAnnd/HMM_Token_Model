i have done a lot of international travel, both on business and as a tourist. for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest: always drink the wine of the country. in this movie the archangel michael comes to earth on business, wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring. boy! does he "drink the wine of the country."<br /><br />could man be drunk forever with liquor, love and fights <br /><br />he'd lief rise up of mornings and lief lie down of nights.<br /><br />these are things you can't do in heaven so he enjoys them while he's here! of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and, if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one, he is just as successful. the final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful. jean stapleton gets to dance with john travolta.
