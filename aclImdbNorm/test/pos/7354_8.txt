after the return of "horror movies" (come on scream isn't scary!) i didn't have very high hopes for this low-budget three story horror movie. but i was positively surprised! man this is scary!!! the first 2 stories are simply brilliant. the first one about a new wed couple driving in a dark forest with their rv, when they bump into a fierce........(watch the movie)! the second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who is home alone for one night.... i know it doesn't sound any special but it is scary. i promise you. the last story isn't scary but atleast not bad. it's about a biker and a ghosthouse. in fact the stories are based on real urban legends(i guess kevin williamson can steal ideas too).rent this movie it is good!!! i'd say i'ts the scariest three-short-story-horror-movie ever made!
