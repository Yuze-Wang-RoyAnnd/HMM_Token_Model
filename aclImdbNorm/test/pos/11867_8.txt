liv tayler in her sexiest movie! <br /><br />she incorporates the "femme fatale" role in an astonishing way, while in the same time she manages to appear a super sexy woman while keeping the "sweet girl" stand and not being over-wicked like other similar movies (e.g. "femme fatale" with rebecca romijn)<br /><br />until this movie, lord of the rings was the only movie i ever saw her (im hooked on with lotr)<br /><br />point: by lotr i had shaped an opinion that the role of the pure-sweet woman was the only role that liv tayler could interpret, but when i saw "one night at mc cool" i absolutely changed my mind. she is the sexiest woman ever!<br /><br />therefore as a film is a mediocre common comedy with a "confusing" plot
