this movie has a lot to recommend it. the paintings, the music, and david hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! the plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. but, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. it often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but i never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*. and if it's not a parody, well, it remains a movie with great potential that it didn't live up to.
