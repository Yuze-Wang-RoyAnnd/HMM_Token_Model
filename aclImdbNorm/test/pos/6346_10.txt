i've seen lonesome dove, dead man's walk, and the streets of laredo, and now the return to lonesome dove. if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove, this'll fill yer belly. great cast, great story. most definitely a close second to lonesome dove. i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection. this is the best, or at least my favorite performance by jon voight. he is captain call. lou gossett jr. playing isom pickett is not somebody i'd mess with, he is a bad ass with perspective. william peterson does a great job as well. rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue. my only problem with this film (and it's really picking nits) is that i had the impression that call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in montana", and it's obvious that dunnigan had already been there a while. a little inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale. i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper fant and july johnson. i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel.
