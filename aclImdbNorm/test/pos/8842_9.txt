"the thing" is john carpenter's best movie. merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie.<br /><br />by filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. the ensemble cast work well together with kurt russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard.<br /><br />by building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects meister rob bottin - currently directing freddy vs jason) carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. considering this came out the same year as et it could not be more different!<br /><br />worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10.<br /><br />p.s. the dvd is excellent. lots of extras plus the best dvd commentary going (with carpenter & russell). plus remixed in dolby digital for even scarier sound effects.
