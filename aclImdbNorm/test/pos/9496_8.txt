i thought this movie was really good. it ends up showing the viewers in the end that leila should of kept what she had. leila was sick of her husband jim, who was more worried about work then her. he was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary. he was also very sloppy. she couldn't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her. the movie shows that he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night he messed up. he goes to her and tries to bring her home. she ends up finding another man named schuyler. he seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her. in the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at schuylers shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way jim did the same kinda thing. jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up. leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because thats all she really wanted and he did changing.
