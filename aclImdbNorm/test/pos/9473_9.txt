i just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and i can't remember a movie where i laughed so hard -- literal out loud, deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious. granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end. the actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable. the actors were perfectly cast. my children mentioned that amanda bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives. she is so refreshing. my children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006. our money was well spent on this movie.
