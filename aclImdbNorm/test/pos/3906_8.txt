i remember watching this movie when it came out as a t.v. movie of the week in the early 1970's.<br /><br />although i haven't seen this movie in over 30 years i remember how creepy it was...the sister's dead body in the basement, the storm raging outside, the creepy house with no electricity and a killer still on the premises.<br /><br />they just don't make t.v. movies like this one anymore. elizabeth montgomery was a very underrated actress and i liked her in not only "betwitched", but several of her post-bewitched roles, such as this one and 1975's "the legend of lizzie borden".<br /><br />i really wish that someone would come out with a dvd that has several of the 1970's t.v. movie of the week on one dvd. wouldn't it be awesome to watch "when michael calls", "bad ronald", "don't be afraid of the dark", "crowhaven farm", etc., all on one dvd? i know there is a market for a dvd like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's. maybe, if we are lucky, someday someone will offer us a dvd with a great selection of t.v. movies like this.
