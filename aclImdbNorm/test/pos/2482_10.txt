it kicks you in the stomach. there are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations. but then again, most of these are not directed by peter watkins. maybe the one true genius artist of british film to emerge out of the 1960s, watkins has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outer-aesthetic world - the world of political ongoings, social problems and governmental solutions. thus, his work is probably less "filmic" than, say, political, which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality. then again, why shouldn't art allow itself to become engaged? watkins dares. and succeeds. you won't feel well with this one. you won't feel happy. actually, you won't really like the film; it is uncompromising, honest, direct, unashamed; a smash in your face, in short. you can't help getting angry, you can't resist to let the things you see touch you. that is what makes watkins' films so rewarding.
