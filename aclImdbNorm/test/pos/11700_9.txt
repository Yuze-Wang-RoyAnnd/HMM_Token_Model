while not for everyone, crackerjack is a delight to watch, with tongue planted firmly in cheek. the likeable character of jack simpson, played by mick molloy, is scamming the local "bowlo" for free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side, selling the parking space to work colleagues. when the bowling club members need to raise some money to save their club, they call upon jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls.<br /><br />filled with aussie charm, the laconic wit of mick molloy is showing through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his earlier work in radio. perfect aussie casting with bill hunter as jack's bowling mentor stan coombes, john clarke (of the games fame) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowls club owner bernie fowler, with samuel johnson as jack's flatmate dave, and judith lucy as the jaded journalist, nancy.<br /><br />initially, i figured only fans of molloy would like this flick but judging by the number of the blue rinse set exiting the cinema chuckling, this is a film for everyone.
