looks like the bet movie i've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive. antonioni is comparably wise to his movie. malkovich's so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. i've change my world outlook after this cinema. i'm a beginner literati in russia -- country of tolstoy and dostoevskiy -- and i'm quite sure watching antonioni is good and fun for russkies, because i and we do understand his point of view. so i don't understand his lesser raiting on imdb. i'm sure, speaking from russia and our people, we like antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality
