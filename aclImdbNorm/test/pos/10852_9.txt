i loved this movie. not because of the romantic story lines between women, but for the visualization of human strength, despair, and liberation. this film is a must see. entertaining! emotional! captivating! all the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors. this story is a story of self discovery and sexual awakening. a journey of the mind, body and soul. you find yourself identifying with the characters and at some points, even the storyline. <br /><br />i do have to say that i recommend watching the movie first, then read the book. if you read the book first, you will be slightly disappointed. the screenplay adaption cut out a lot and some things were changed. some for the better and some for the worst.
