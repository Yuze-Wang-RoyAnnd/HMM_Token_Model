i like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem. i caught this totally at random on the movie channel last night, and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way. there's really just a toally unique voice to the film, a poetry of narration that's meaningful without straying into pretension. there's also many hilarious moments from wirey's middle-school days that are crude without being potty humor. it's sad that this movie is so low-rated. the fact that there are so many 1's makes me think the numbers are cooked- i can't see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal. sure, this is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life, of a man whose very appeal comes from his detachment, a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him. give this flick a chance. it came out of nowhere for me, and i feel the richer for it.
