just got into viewing program for the first time recently - the 2-hour "kidnapping" program. don't know why i didn't sooner?? james caan is outstanding and wholly-believable in the role as the chief honcho at the featured 5* vegas complex.<br /><br />so often, programs like this have one or more in the ensemble who are either outright annoying, or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the producer or director.<br /><br />that is certainly not the case with this program. along with caan, all of the primary and supporting cast are engaging attractive, and believable. the guest actors are well-chosen. <br /><br />the stories i've seen are interesting, and the show presents a good view of the city as well.<br /><br />this is an entertaining program, and one i hope will remain. i don't know how i managed to miss it for so long, but plan to tivo it from now on.
