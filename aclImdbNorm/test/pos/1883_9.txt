i saw this last week during bruce campbell's book tour. i thought it was amazing. almost everything i would expect from a bruce campbell sci-fi movie. its campy and very funny. ted raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. the plot is wacky, an american business man goes to bulgaria and is killed. stacy keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings bruce campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-kgb turned cabbie. bruce campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the kgb agent. the movie has all the great bruce campbell slap stick and humor. the movie is somewhat predictable, i knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. however i didn't go to see this movie because i thought it would have an oscar winning script, i went to see it because it was a bruce campbell sci-fi movie and i was not disappointed in the least. i highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. although before the movie he said the sci-fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it tv friendly. if you are a fan of bruce, i highly recommend it.
