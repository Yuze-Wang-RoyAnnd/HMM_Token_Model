i saw this last night and voted it an "8". since then, it's grown on me and i'd give it a "9".<br /><br />the film has (at first) a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves. the first half is a comedy and there's little hint of the ragged truths of eras, life, wars, religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half. while at first it may be a little disconcerting because it's a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence, on reflection it works.<br /><br />the acting was good (hultz in the role of alex, the interpreter, was especially great).<br /><br />i've scanned most other "user comments" and see that some who've read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not. both feelings, of course, are valid.<br /><br />for me, a retired family therapist and one-world believer, the film was relevant on two different levels.<br /><br />the first, as history, gave a powerful reminder of how commonly polarizations happen -- with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a smidge different moral value system than our own. <br /><br />the second was that in demonstrating the first, it also revealed something in common to each of us, all our families -- that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves.<br /><br />t.s. eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his "four quartets" when he said: -- "we shall not cease from exploration// and the end of all our exploring// will be to arrive where we started// and know the place for the first time." <br /><br />jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating -- to explore and discover our roots; what were those people going through then, who were they -- really! -- before, when, and during the early years before and after we were born? etc. <br /><br />so the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy, then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies, but through all that it also gives us -- subliminally -- a message about each of ourselves. all of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started.
