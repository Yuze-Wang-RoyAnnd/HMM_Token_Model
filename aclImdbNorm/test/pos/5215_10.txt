this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole. this is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with his wife and children, fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman. to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks. predictable, but not a bad watch.
