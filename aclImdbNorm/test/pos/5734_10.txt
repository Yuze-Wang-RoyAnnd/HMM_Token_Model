i cannot believe someone gave this movie a 1 rating!!! and it is only a 3. average... what is not to love about this film? it is original, it has lots of scare scenes that actually made me jump out of my seat, and it has some great special effects. the story is fresh, there is some nudity, and it is very campy. the killer was scary in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected. i must admit that i really love this film, one of spain's best horror films ever. if you consider yourself a true horror fan you need to get out there and try to find this film. you will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
