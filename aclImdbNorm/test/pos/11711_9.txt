in the tradition of "neo" film noir flicks like "chinatown", this film focuses on a crime mystery in a bleak realm with a bit of character insight blended in. the typical noir characters thoughout, including the cop out to prove himself, a damsel in distress and a bad, bad guy. sharky's machine gets a 9 out of 10 for its cinematography first, plus its direction, story, strong character acting and superb jazz score. available on dvd, though the soundtrack itself is out of print (but available "used" on some auction sites). filmed on location in beautiful downtown atlanta (novelist diehl's hometown) and the uncluttered, circa 1979 look of the city would make an old-time atlanta citizen or visitor long for the old days before 12-lane interstates crisscrossed the city, a cinematographer's dream at that time. this was rachel ward's first usa feature film.
