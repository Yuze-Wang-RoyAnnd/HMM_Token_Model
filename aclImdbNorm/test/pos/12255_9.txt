if you have not seen this late 80s film about the the washington bureau of a network news station than i highly recommend it. it is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country but tells the story with wit. the characters are well developed and albert brooks performance is fabulous. he delivers all his lines with entertaining understated comedy. i am not an albert brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise. i have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advised that this is close to reality so kudos to the films writer and director for doing their research.<br /><br />fun movie with a lot of insight into the world of network news. it is not nearly as dark as another movie i also recommend in the same genre 'network'.
