errol flynn's roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous (and some would say infamous) general custer, that follows his career from his first day at west point, through the civil war and out west to the battle at the little big horn, all the while butting heads with rival arthur kennedy and romancing pretty olivia de havilland.<br /><br />some might say that flynn, who delivers a great, flamboyant performance as the general, is basically playing himself playing custer!<br /><br />a lavish production (that should have been in technicolor) well directed by raoul walsh, they died with their boots on features some truly well-staged battle sequences. also, it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse.<br /><br />the previous year, flynn played jeb stuart opposite ronald reagan's george custer in santa fe trail (also with de havilland), another action-packed warner brothers production designed to make you fail history class!
