at the time of this writing (january 25, 2006), i am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of chris penn. other than footloose, the wild life is the film that i remember chris most from.<br /><br />i still remember in the film, with slight fondness, of chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup.<br /><br />anyhow, my comment is in regards to the title track sung by bananarama. after these many years, i still remember the rumour (canadian spelling -- lol) that bananarama was called in at the very very last moment to compose the track for the film and that they wrote the song on the plane bound to the recording studio to record the song and just after they recorded the song they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track. i heard that this entire process (from start to finish) took 4 hours to do! if this is true, then they truly are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time.<br /><br />anyhow this is just a rumour i had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later. perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify. thanks.
