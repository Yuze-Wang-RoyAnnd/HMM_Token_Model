at first i thought this film was going to annoy me.it was as though i had seen this movie somewhere before. the disillusioned hero, the father figure and the 9 year old sister who is older and wiser than her years (see gregory's girl), but then, not 15 minutes in, it became a laugh out loud, comic gem of a movie. dylan moran (who i thought was just going to bug me) was excellent. as was mr gambon and the mad scottish hitman. lena headey was extremely sexy. for half of the film i was trying to remember where i'd seen her before. the parole officer. she has the most amazing smile. but clearly the true hero of this film is mr caine. this man should do much more comedy. this ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles (without a clue, dirty rotten scoundrels). he is a pleasure to watch in all of his scenes but especially the end.<br /><br />no one can quite say f**k the way michael can. <br /><br />
