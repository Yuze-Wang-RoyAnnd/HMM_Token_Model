man am i stoked i can leave feedback for this 10 minutes romp. i love it.<br /><br />after not seeing it in years, i happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over.<br /><br />'stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock and roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are freaking classic lines.<br /><br />the art is delightfully raw. the dialog sparse and wonderful. just find it and love it. cannot recommend this enough.<br /><br />thank you high school art teacher mrs. kogan for showing us this over and over. thank you nfb for letting it be made. thank you mts for showing it (for free at the moment at least).<br /><br />i want a big snit t-shirt now. i'd love an animation cell, but at 440.00 a pop, that won't happen.<br /><br />find this flick, and watch it.
