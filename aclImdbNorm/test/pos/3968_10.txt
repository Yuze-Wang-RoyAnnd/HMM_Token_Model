when i saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy american movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. i was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. the movie centres around bartely or b who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play b is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. however loads of people see his fake website and join. feeling their sorrows b can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate. the college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing. the school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down. the film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it. its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists.
