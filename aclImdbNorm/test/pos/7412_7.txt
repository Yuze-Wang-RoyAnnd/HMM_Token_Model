i just saw this movie in a sneak preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very subjective because i love techno, trance, club, house and music like that.<br /><br />the movie deals with carl, whose brother jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell off a rooftop, "drunk". carl meets his brother's girlfriend sunny and the two of them quite unmotivated some kind of private investigation about jason's death and carl gets involved in jason's ex-life that was filled with clubs and drugs. the movie itself, seen from an artistic point of view, is nothing more than a big pile of s**t. the plot is predictable, all of the characters are extremely cliched and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, young good-looking innocent girl, big bad drug king... the list is endless) and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible. matthew rhys' performance of the stupid boy coming to big london and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible, unlike his female counterpart sunny, performed by sienna guillory, whose behaviour seems more realistic to the spectator. nothing more than a joke was tim curry's performance of the drug king damian: a phony caricature, too "eeeevil" and just too ridiculous to be true.<br /><br />but: if you like club music (the club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant), if you enjoy a simple lovestory with a sweet girl like sunny (yes, i confess, i lost my heart ;)... that makes my comment even more subjective, i guess) with some (predictable) twists and turns you will definetely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />anybody else: f.o.r.g.e.t.....i.t.!<br /><br />3 out of 10 (objective view)<br /><br />7 out of 10 (my personal view and also my final vote)
