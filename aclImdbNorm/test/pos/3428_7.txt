an interesting comedy, taking place on a train from stockholm to berlin, december 1945. one can't help to feel sorry for the poor writer/critic who quits his job and jumps on the train to berlin. his ambition is to make a difference, and to participate in building the new unified europe after the war has ended.<br /><br />i like the black and white format of the movie, as well as the closed scenery of a train in motion.<br /><br />robert gustafsson makes a classic "gustafsson-role" in this movie. if you're a fan of him, this movie is for you!<br /><br />the philosopher wittgenstein, through his saying "one can never assume that anything is what it seems to be", is referenced several times in the movie.
