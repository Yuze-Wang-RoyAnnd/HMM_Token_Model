when the episode was made and aired eisenhower was president. kennedy was president-elect.<br /><br />as for the episode, it was a passable episode, if not a bit earnest. "the professor" shows not much range here, and the whole thing seems a little rushed (a lot of episodes of the tz seem to not fit the time slot, some seeming like they're crammed in and rushed, some with little or nothing to it spread out over the half hour, and some, of course fit). i guess you just expect a little more tension than to be taken back to some rooms and drugged. but overall a decent episode. indeed the "what if" motif of time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table of with basic interest.<br /><br />7 out of 10, considering there were a lot of tz episodes not quite as good, and some a great deal better.
