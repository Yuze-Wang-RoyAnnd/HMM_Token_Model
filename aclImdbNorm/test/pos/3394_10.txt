whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. this is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. the story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. the storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie. there are characters you will fall in love with, there are characters you will hate, and you will find yourself emotionally involved.<br /><br />both my wife and i loved it, and we will watch it again in a few years, i'm sure.
