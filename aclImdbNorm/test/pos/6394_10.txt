this show is great for many reasons..the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age. its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family. i watched this one time and became hooked.it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching. this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates,death etc .the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way. great show for the family ..i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off. great pg 13 rated show.i loved everybit of this show.
