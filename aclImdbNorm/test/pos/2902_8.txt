i saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with "valley of the kings." these movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in egyptology. (in 1975 i visited egypt!) seen today, "the egyptian" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the big screen.
