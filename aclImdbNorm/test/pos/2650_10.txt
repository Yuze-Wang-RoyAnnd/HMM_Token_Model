being a big fan of stanley kubrick's clockwork orange there was of course "no question about it" that i had to see this one. however i put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing happened" "a complete waste of time". but when i saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith i was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: a space odyssey. there was no doubt in my mind that i was going to rent that movie the same evening. <br /><br />it turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. of course, watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful, but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it. my god... i like my friends a lot but it's a pity that i can't share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. that thing, my friends, is beauty. as this film goes to show, beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced, intellectually shallow, consumer driven fast-food western societies. that doesn't mean however that i reject these fast-paced societies or that i look down on them (and neither does kubrick) but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in. and what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming. <br /><br />when we go to this place it is possible to get a so called "natural high". it is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty. and never in my life has this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm" as it is called by some or "samaddhi" by others been more intense. yes it's more intense than a regular orgasm... several times more intense actually. many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right. are they right? for me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe. in my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it: "except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at jupiter the four-million year old black monolith has remained completely inert. its origin and purpose are still a total mystery." the trance that bowman experiences is the same thing i experience when watching those gorgeous visuals. <br /><br />i can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast-food answers to big ontological questions. but instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers. the doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble, while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame. but this film shows us that when fast ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world. from the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself" the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating, enchanting and maybe even comforting. we don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. when we are able to let mystery be what it is, to embrace it even... we can finally bring our souls to rest. i am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed. especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.
