i was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's seattle film fest screening, and was blown away by how great it was. this is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries i've ever seen, (and i've seen a lot!) this is a loving look back at the life and times, music and relationships of one of music's true legends. harry nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of gershwin, cole porter, and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards. he was considered a peer by all four members of the beatles, who all called him a 5th beatle, and one the same wavelength as themselves.<br /><br />harry refused to tour, so many today don't remember him, and those born after his heyday, are unaware of who he was. this is tragic. everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent. this film is a step in the right direction, to finally give the man his due. unfortunately, the film has yet to have wide distribution, or even a dvd so for the time being, good luck in getting to see it.<br /><br />if you are someone with the power to put together a dvd distribution deal, please contact the film makers. this film needs to be available. hey vh-1, how about screening it on air, then maybe putting it out on dvd? harry nilsson deserves nothing less.
