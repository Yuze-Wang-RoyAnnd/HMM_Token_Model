this film is a perfect example of great escapism! i loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning. sure it's just an action flick, but isn't having fun what watching movies is all about? <br /><br />the cast of this film are very strong with likable characters. the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing, it's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys!! sean astin makes a great rebel, successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager.<br /><br />if you want fun, watch this film! i thoroughly enjoyed it even though i was watching it on a very dirty and old vhs that was terrible quality (go dvd's!)
