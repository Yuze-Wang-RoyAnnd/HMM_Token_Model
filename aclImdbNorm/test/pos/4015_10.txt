***spoilers ahead*** my late childhood had two cinematographic icons: star wars and this film by czech genius karel zeman. a jules verne encyclopedia where xix century illustrations come to life in exquisite black and white photography, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. verne's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern questioning on the moral limits of power and advanced technology. in fact, it brings atomic energy into verne's universe in a very elliptic and elegant way. also elliptic and elegant is the demise of the villain, with a (probably nuclear) explosion sending his hat flying over the sea. the resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory, something very rare today, when a lot of films don't seem to know how to end themselves.<br /><br />i was fortunate to catch this gem in reruns on local tv in the late 70s: it enhanced my enjoyment of verne's fiction and of cinema.<br /><br />10 out of 10 for karel zeman, under-appreciated master of imagination.
