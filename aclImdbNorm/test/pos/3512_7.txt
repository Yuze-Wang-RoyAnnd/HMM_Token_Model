i was lucky enough to see the "horror classics" dvd version of this film before it was mysteriously removed from the 4 film dvd and replaced with something else. the picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was a nightmare in itself. yet, that version is still superior to the one with the deluxe dvd treatment. the reason was stated in brad fiedel's interview segments on the special edition dvd. he had noted what i first found so striking about this film. this being the use of music at moments of inactivity in the film, but leaving the moments of activity in silence, thus giving the horror scenes a stronger feel. the problem with this reissue is it carries the extra film score used to fill in these intentional gaps in score. fiedel complained of this and made it clear that the filler music was not his. the music actually sounded a lot like howard shore's work for videodrome. sad for me that i am also a major fan of that film and have to associate the two.<br /><br />the film itself managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the genre horror film. a group of friends go up on a mountain one of them inherited. on the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmarish secret. the movie moves along at a great pace. in fact every time i have seen it, i still find myself shocked to see 45 minutes had passed before things started really going wrong for the campers.<br /><br />while the horror classics version is filled with many gaps, the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film intelligent and even superior to most slasher films i have ever seen. the director jeff lieberman had made some unique horror films previous to this one making this one the most mainstream and yet, very different to the mainstream at the same time. it is a good fun film with surprising acting performances to boot. the new spiffed up dvd version is worth a rent, the now collectors item horror classics version, now oop is worth the hunt.
