this is precious. everything is illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. oh, how i've been waiting for this to arrive in austin. while elijah wood is charming as ever as jonathan safran foer (the real-life author of the novel everything is illuminated), it's eugene hutz (playing jonathan's ukrainian tour-guide and translator, alex) who truly steals this film. alex is a hip-hop-lovin' ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps jonathan find the woman who saved jonathan's grandfather's life during world war ii. the ukrainian countryside has never looked so breath taking. i'm thinking of packing it all up and moving to the former soviet state.<br /><br />the tone of the film, however, shifts when jonathan and alex do finally meet the woman they're looking for, and suddenly, this adorable comedy turns into a heart-breaking historical drama about a jewish village that was annihilated during the nazi occupation. everything is illuminated is about history, heritage, and the wisdom that can be gained from uncovering the past. it's perfect.
