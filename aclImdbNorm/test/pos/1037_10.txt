i saw this series on pbs in 1980 in college and i still can't get it out of my head, although i have never seen it since. i remember every cast member (the casting was perfect, as mentioned in other comments), the design, the lighting and, of course, the story, which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set. probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original "roots."
