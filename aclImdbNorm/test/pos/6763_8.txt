it is a wonderful film about people. strange people. the characters in the movie all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. their problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd; but that does not make the movie worse, only better, for it is shot in a kind of fantasy-like way, so nothing is real. this review might sound a little weird, but then again, the movie is not quite normal... it is also a hilarious movie at many times. if you have not seen it, see it. enjoy!
