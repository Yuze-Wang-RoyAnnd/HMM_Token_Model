this is an excellent b-film horror movie that borders between horror and comedy. it is about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space. can it get more unreal? it is a hybrid between "alien" and "chain saw massacre." the movie was shot in stockholm with a mixed cast of americans and swedes that interact beautifully. director martin munthe does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience. the movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. stinger has all qualities of a b-film horror movie. it is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. it is great to see that movies like this can still be made! i would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films.
