i am sorry to see that surface has not been picked up for the nbc 2006-2007 season. i guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has conquered a good story. i hope and pray that some network picks it up so it will continue on as does stargate and it's spin-offs.<br /><br />i also hope the producers find a venue where they can produce the level of post production they wished for in a tv guide interview. right now the reruns on sci-fi, marathons, will have to do. i for one would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended episode 15. i would like to find out the mastermind of the efficient effort to obfuscate the real identity of the creatures.<br /><br />fyc morningbear
