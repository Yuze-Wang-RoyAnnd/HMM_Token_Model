quite a production from the director telling the story of the qin emperor's ambitious plan to unite all kingdoms of china. some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. however, i was not blown away by the film in terms of the actors ability (which was good i enjoyed the marquis the most) or its look (although the massing of troops was extremely impressive, if it was real man that is a lot of extras!).<br /><br />i have seen li gong in other movies and she is always great. good period piece i think, but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. good film and found the 2 1/2 + hours not a problem.<br /><br />rating 7 out of 10.
