i've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was in it as well didn't give me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through. so i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn't convince you to go watch it then it also has chad michael murray in it which can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh?
