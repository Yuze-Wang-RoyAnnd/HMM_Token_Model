i saw this once probably like most people my age(55) back in the 60's. i understand the dissatisfaction with the final product by both families. but this is a great movie, it was a great opera; but as a film it is wonderful. this film should be released at least to video, other generations can gain an appreciation of great music and story telling. the cast was made up of some of the greatest black actors ever, most have now passed away; only sidney p. is still with us. please don't wait until he is gone and the film as all old film does, becomes unusable do to the ravages of time. again this is a great film which is something that one does not see very often today, if at all.
