caught this recently after noticing james earl jones name on the title. it was better than i expected. of course it's pretty old - made during the early/mid 70's but it actually is a decent drama. it runs a quick 90min or so and showcases good performances from james earl jones and diahann caroll. the plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on welfare who has 6 children and trying to deal with all the problems that persist. this makes for an interesting view.....also in the fact that the script wasn't too sentimental or overdramatized - it's almost like looking at a slice of the past. all the 70's styles are out in abundance. the ending is kind of kooky though....probably would've done better without the theatrics.
