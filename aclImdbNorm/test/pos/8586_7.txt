it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few. however, the movie depicts lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one..., i felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership, yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man. there was too little content, explaining how the man got to rise in the first place, and the whole context of belgium "letting them go". so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent, especially mobutu himself. i would just have liked a better political analysis.
