together with the even more underrated , the sun shines bright, wagon master was one of ford's favorite films. it is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of ford's 'stock company', including jane darwell, alan mowbray, ward bond,and harry carey, jr.like almost all of ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. it is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of indians than in most of ford's movies. ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of american democracy.
