a very good movie about anti-semitism near the end of wwii. the scene that really speaks loudly of the ignorance of these people is the meeting at the church when the priest is giving his speech against the "international money grubbers and communists". it sounds amazingly like the speeches that adolph hitler used to force down his peoples' throats, yet none of the meeting attendees seem to make this comparison.
