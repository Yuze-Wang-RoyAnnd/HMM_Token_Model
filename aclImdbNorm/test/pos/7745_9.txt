i've rented this gem several times! it's a small, yet somehow sprawling masterpiece taking the viewer from manhattan glitz to the beauty of the greek islands. john cassavetes on-screen marriage to his real-life wife gena rowlands is on the rocks. he finds meaning in a fling with footloose susan sarandon whom he finds in greece while their daughter, played in her earliest film role by the pubescent molly ringwald, falls for the son of the greek shipping tycoon who is courting her mother on a yacht sailing in neighboring waters. meanwhile, the immensely talented raul julia plays a goatherd living in a cave with his sony trinitron. he has the "hots" for molly ringwald's character until confronted by john cassavetes. all comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where all is reconciled. raul julia, the goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat. this film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexiness, and more. see it!
