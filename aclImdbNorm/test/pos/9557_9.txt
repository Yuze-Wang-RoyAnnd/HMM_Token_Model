"best in show" is certainly christopher guest's funniest and deepest movie yet. the characters are excellently portrayed and the connection of pet to owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie. i've been a fan of guest since spinal tap but in this movie he has truly achieved what he set out to do in the "mock-umentary," a genre he invented and has now perfected.
