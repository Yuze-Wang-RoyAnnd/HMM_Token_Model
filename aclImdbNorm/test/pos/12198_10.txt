surface is one of the greatest t.v. series i have seen. the acting is great and the storyline enthralling. each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next. i especially thought carter jenkins who played miles bennett did a superb job...he is a very talented actor and i look forward to seeing more of his work. <br /><br />i can't believe surface only made one season...once again the public has let me down. it is hard to fathom that a great shows like this one would get canceled, while crap reality shows continue on year after year. whoever made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball on this one.
