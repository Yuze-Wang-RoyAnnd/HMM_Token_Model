i've been playing this movie incessantly this month, and i just love it. i was around in the 60s (oh dear), so it is nostalgic in one sense. however, it's the funny premise, the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching.<br /><br />dr. winston's reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless. (i'd be more specific, but don't want to spoil it for anyone.) who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the up-and-up and yet have us still love him? as for bergman's costumes, i think she looks as dowdy as she's supposed to. i think "she was robbed" the one time that she appears in an evening gown. it doesn't suit her at all, which is too bad. i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still don't.<br /><br />goldie won an oscar for her role. people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time, and yet it's the one performance that i don't love as much as the others. she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability, however, which is important for this role.<br /><br />and i agree - i thought rick lenz was great in it and it's too bad that his movie career didn't take off after this.<br /><br />i hope more people watch this movie ... they'll love it!
