even if you're not a "theatre person," i highly recommend that you see this. based off of a play of the same name by christopher bond (which, in turn, had been based off of an old london legend), sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. the score is just amazing-- by far sondheim's best, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. the show was cast extremely well, my only complaint being of betsy joscelyn's portrayal of johanna. it;s good, mind you, and she's a very versatile actress, but she just doesn't sing "greenfinch and linnet bird" too well. but other than that, it's all phenomenal-- angela lansbury *made* the role of mrs. lovette, and she just does it so well. george hearn was a good replacement for len cariou in the title role, and ken jennings gives a great performance as tobias. the ending will give you chills. top marks for a wonderful show.
