i saw this in a theatre back in 1982. i expected a stupid t&a movie. that's not what i got.<br /><br />it's basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex. we get the expected sex jokes and scenes--but, for once, they're actually pretty funny!<br /><br />yeah, they're stupid but i enjoyed them anyways. also, there was a surprising amount of male nudity.<br /><br />then the movie, about halfway through, takes a sudden dramatic turn as one of the boys (winningly played by lawrence monoson) falls in love with a girl. then the jokes stop and things get very dark. i'm not going to give away what happens but i was very surprised at the sudden turn in events. the movie brings up some very important subjects and treats them realistically and with intelligence. and it has a real heart-breaking ending.<br /><br />i'm giving this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedy/dramas ever made. it mixes fantasy and realism together and works! what more can you ask for? also it has a great soundtrack.
