an awesome made for the sci-fi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they've churned out. bruce campbell is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professor,stacey keach,and his half-wit assistance,ted raimi. the film is pure b movie gold and its great to see keach and ram up on screen with bruce, and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on bruce's comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious, and makes me ask the question, why isn't this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned?, it indeed a sick world. definitely worth a watch.
