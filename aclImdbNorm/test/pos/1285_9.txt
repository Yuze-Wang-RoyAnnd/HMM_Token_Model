just watched this on dvd three times - once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. quite amazing. a bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. <br /><br />i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent memento, which turned me on to nolan in the first place. can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film, insomnia.
