i know that to include everything in the book, the film would have to have been several hours long, so i think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story. i thought the casting was great, the children who played amir and hassan were very good actors. and the guy who played amir as an adult was great! the scenes between him and baba were especially touching. i thought the locations they used were interesting... scenes set in afghanistan were shot in china, and one scene that took place in fremont, ca (the graduation scene) was actually shot on treasure island in san francisco. i worked one day as an extra on "kite runner" and it was that day, the day they shot the graduation scene. we reported to treasure island in the morning, they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s, an then we took our places in the audience. they shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. it was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the book's author, who was on hand as a story consultant. i thought this book was excellent and i recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. this is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption.
