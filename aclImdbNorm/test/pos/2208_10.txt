there is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. the parental absence at all important junctures in lauren ambrose's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading. the incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another; thus masking her mother's truer involvement in family losses. the daughter, lauren, really has done something big - trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself, somewhat heroic in light of the age she is - still giving when everyone around her taking, somersaults on her. a heart not yet connected to her head - something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day. her replacement of a significant other, not necessarily requiring a father image, however, a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real. a pure cup without a handler .......(see the movie). everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world - she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time. she has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress ... given a bird in a cage... not a puppy... that would a least get her walking two times a day. ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life. sad is the looming psychiatric ending... how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility? (believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life) the symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story. the neighbor college freshman is developed just fine, he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning. i myself, eventually just went to the mensa magazine and got a $20.00 degree saying i was an (hon)ddiv. it offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content. "run the world" or do not get your own home was the college offer. who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning? the only sin is not having your pleasure right. what fight figged on that? she has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life. what is college, a reward for failing high school? do you graduate with your class or without it - what is the exchange? a lifetime of correcting youth with only questions? could lead occur w/o a question? the loss followed as much for good as bad. when was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled? why didn't good people treat her with good things? if good people do not do good things for good people, what is good for? she is young, pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game. her act taken in life with a closed door. perhaps the title would be better as "christmas doors" not "admissions".
