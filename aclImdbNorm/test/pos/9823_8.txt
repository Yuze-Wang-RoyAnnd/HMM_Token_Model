like many others, i had been attracted to the combination of pollack, ford and scott-thomas. i had enjoyed the work of pollack and ford on sabrina, a well made film and a careful rewrite of the old material. on hearing that this film was in production i ordered and read the book. immediately it seemed that this would be a more difficult story to film. the characters are not always sympathetic, there is little if any humor and the author makes numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his principal theme: that, since each would see the other as the only one sharing the unique combination of loss and betrayal brought on by the air crash, the adulterers' completely surprised spouses would seek each other out. moreover, he imagines that resolution could come to both through a bitter exploration of the adulterers' hidden lives and that this experience of "thick and thin" could yield a deeper love than each had previously. although much of the book deals with their bitterness and their building hatred of their former partners, in the end acceptance and forgiveness are found. the film script retains only the air crash and the shared predicament of the spouses. where the woman is the research aggressor in the book, it is the man in the film and the woman is never a willing co-researcher. the film has a completely new dramatic sub-plot for harrison ford which seems even more contrived than the double coincidence of the air crash. the "congresswoman up for re-election" sub-plot for the woman is also new, yet it works better. audience the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy cannot be met because this story focusses on a very bitter pill. where resolution and forgiveness is achieved in the book, however, lifting the burden of bitterness from the reader and permitting levity, there is no corresponding moment in the film. although forgiveness is never hinted at, we are left to surmise that healing following a shooting does double duty. ford's character need not be such an unentertaining man of few words and scott-thomas's accent change is a little disconcerting at first. this film is not the dead loss suggested by others. it is, however, a difficult film to appreciate because the rewrite and adaptation to the screen is below the standard previously achieved by the director cast.
