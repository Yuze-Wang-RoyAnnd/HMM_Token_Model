lotsa action, cheesy love story, unexpected actors and overall great fun. the special effect are acceptable/decent, some of the fighting is kinda neat with some interesting acrobatic moves. the overall story moves along, and is cheesy enough to keep you wondering when the inevitable is going to happen, although there is a bit of a twist (just a small one). the overall naivety of the movie make it quite whimsical at times. cute enough chicks too what more could you want. ps. if you're gonna review a movie like this, try to review it in terms of the category the movie would fall (not necessarily where it was intended to fall). ie don't bomb out good cheesy movies!
