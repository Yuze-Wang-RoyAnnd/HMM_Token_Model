i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. it is just not available and it has not been on tv for many many years. i enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.<br /><br />my 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. someday i hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it. (oh would i love to see it again too!)<br /><br />
