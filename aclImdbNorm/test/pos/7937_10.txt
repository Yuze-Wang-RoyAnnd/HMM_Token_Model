there is a version of "nevsky" that is shown with a live symphony orchestra, chorus, soloist and the movie. if it's ever performed within a day's travel of you see "nevsky" done that way. the oklahoma city philharmonic did it with the okc canterbury choir (one of the finest anywhere) a couple of years ago. i think i cried through the whole thing, it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life. i'm listening to "nevsky" on the radio right now and it still tears me up. there are movies that i love, and classical music pieces i love, but there is no combination i can think of that comes close to the impact of "nevsky" performed in real time.
