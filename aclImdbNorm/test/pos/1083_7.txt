once again i must play something of the contrarian. most of the reviews for ab tak chappan have been extremely positive. mine is positive, but only slightly. a 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a "c" letter grade from me.<br /><br />it seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors: one, that ab tak chappan is more realistic than the typical bollywood film, and two, that it is trying to do things differently.<br /><br />the first point i couldn't care less about. i'm not looking for realism in films, and so i do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how i believe the real world to be--i'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, although i do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist.<br /><br />for the second point, i agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. however, i don't think "originality" versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. a film can be "original" and poor, just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. what matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer.<br /><br />ab tak chappan is based on the true story of a mumbai cop named daya naik. naik was an "encounter specialist". encounter specialists, who could be said to be early instantiations of real world "judge dredds", are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue, and they're basically given a license to kill--effectively acting as policeman, judge, jury and executioner in a matter of moments. ab tak chappan follows the story of sadhu agashe (nana patekar), the encounter specialist based on naik. we see him at work, interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. we see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his less-than-luxurious surroundings. we see him trying to adjust to a new "commissioner" halfway through the film. and we see his odd relationship with a notorious indian gangster, don zameer zafar (prasad purandhare).<br /><br />all of this has the potential to make a fabulous, gritty film. i agree that it's nice to forgo the typical bollywood musical numbers and romances--not every film needs that stuff; ab tak chappan producer ram gopal varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. additionally, ab tak chappan has some good performances--patekar almost gives off a death wish (1974)-era charles bronson vibe. it also has admirable cinematography--the hand-held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective, for example. it has a great score that mixes more of a moody hollywood-sounding action/crime score with traditional indian instruments and modalities. the violence is well done and gritty.<br /><br />there is also decent exploration of subtexts, including the morality of (having) encounter specialists, the idea of following orders, and so on. the encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. more poignantly, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and, say, members of a country's military, and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to.<br /><br />but (you just knew there was a "but" coming, didn't you?) director shimit amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters, far too much sprawl, and that moves a bit too slow. all of these problems may be due to amin and crew looking at the godfather films, which ab tak chappan has some (at least superficial) resemblances to, although from a policeman's perspective.<br /><br />most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well--these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least, except for agashe and jatin shukla (nakul vaid). for one, narayan, i didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. his name is mentioned a number of times, but i'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and i'd have to start all over figuring out who narayan was.<br /><br />the same thing happened with agashe's first commissioner. the film was already far into the new commissioner before i could figure out the relationships. it seems like there are new characters in every scene. we never learn the stories of most of them. while that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about (because they're mostly doing so on orders), since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists, either, it's difficult to find characters to care about, and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film.<br /><br />the primary villain is zameer. but until about halfway through the film, there's no indication of this. he doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film, and he's literally "phoning his performance in"--he's in another location (dubai), communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. we don't actually see zameer doing much. to an extent, the film depends on a couple "twists" that necessitate not showing zameer doing a number of things, but we could see him do other things, and a lot of the other villains could have been left out.<br /><br />that would have tightened up the film a bit, making it more focused and about a half-hour shorter, both of which would have benefited its impact. this is not an action-packed film by any means. for at least the first 45 minutes or so, i found myself admiring ab tak chappan's considerable style, but saying, "okay, get on with the story already".
