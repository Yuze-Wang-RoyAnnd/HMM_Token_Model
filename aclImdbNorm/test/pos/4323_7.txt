woaww is it only now that you notice the links between all the characters ?? of course it's libby ! and for the guy in the hatch with desmond, any deja vu ??? yeah !! he was the "same" guy that gave money to sayid after he's killed or tortured the other soldier in the episode 14th of the 2nd season : one of them. well actually it's not completely the same guy, he's named joe in the 14th episode and kelvin in the last 2 episodes. twins ?? :) who knows ?? jj abrams ... mmmm i'm not even sure of that :) there are hundreds of links like this one between all the characters.<br /><br />but that was just in response to the libby comment.<br /><br />i found those 2 episodes far more interesting than the whole season 2. during all that season i felt that there was lots of things i've missed and very few things i've learned. especially at the very beginning, the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent, and then the 2nd one is a kind of flash back of the 1st one ... i found that disappointing even if i'm pretty sure that everything in lost tend to have a meaning. that was just an example of how i was frustrated watching those episodes.<br /><br />let's go back to the last 2 episodes. i think we've learned more new things in those 2 episodes than in the entire season. but all we learn are little pieces for the next puzzle, like the involvement of desmond's "relatives" (sorry if i spoil too much, believe me or not i'm trying not to) for example. so lots of things evoked in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once then nothing. and still, there's new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough. we all want to see the big picture of all of it of course, but i think we'll have to be very very patient. i hope there will be only 3 seasons. i'm not sure i will watch more than 3 seasons anyway. there was also lots of actions in the very last episode. and a good cliffhanger at the very end.<br /><br />so basically, yes i loved that last episode ... and yes i want to see the third season.
