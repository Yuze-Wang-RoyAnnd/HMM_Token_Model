sadly, this movie is relegated to 'curio' status it seems. many people that i've asked "did you know the monkees made a movie?" usually answer 'no.' that being said, if you are one of that large number, i recommend you see it, but with the following caveat(s): if you expect monkey style humor, it is in there. it's just not all over the place like the tv shows.<br /><br />yes, they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by poking fun at it like a bunch of no-longer-teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks.<br /><br />no, you don't have to be inebriated to enjoy it.<br /><br />no, you don't have to be inebriated to understand it.<br /><br />if you like classics, you'll love the interspersed clips throughout.<br /><br />if you like the psychedelic era, you'll love some of the cameos.<br /><br />if you are a monkees fan, you might recognize some of the jabs they are taking at the heavy commercializing of the band.<br /><br />in the nigh-immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it: "this is a weird movie, man." in fact it might be better if you don't try to understand it, just sit back and react to it. it's weird, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still)...it is many things. overall, it is an experience.
