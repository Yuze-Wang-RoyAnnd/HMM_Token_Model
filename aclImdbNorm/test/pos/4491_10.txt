i will never forget the utterly absorbing effect this show had on me when i saw it for the first time. from the moment that the major is startled by the clown, to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation ( " we're alive, we're people, we must have memories!" inexact quote but close), to his clever attempt to improvise a means of escape, this is riveting drama.<br /><br />little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it. the moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone, to the off key, screeching bagpipes of the scottish musician; the tramp's wistful remark, " a miss is as good as a mile", the major's shaken conclusion that they must be in hell.<br /><br />this is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and acted. the breathtaking beauty of susan harrison adds to the memorability of the strange, touching story.
