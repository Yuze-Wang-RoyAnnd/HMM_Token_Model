i actually flipped to lifetime channel by mistake, just as this movie was beginning, and ended-up watching it. <br /><br />it certainly deals with a serious issue, probably more prevalent than we realize, in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego-maniacal fellow-student, who feels he's above the system, and, unfortunately, often is.<br /><br />the cast here was believable, and the performances credible. a lot of these canadian/lifetime flicks are decidedly "over-the-top." however, this is one i might label as "under-the-top."<br /><br />while appreciating the fact that it wasn't presented in an overblown fashion, this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper, the 96 minutes seemed like many more, and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film, looped over-and-over, seemingly going on and on and on and on - before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion.<br /><br />yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type, despite these criticisms.<br /><br />and while these pictures often "milk" the climax, this one could have given it a bit more detail and length.
