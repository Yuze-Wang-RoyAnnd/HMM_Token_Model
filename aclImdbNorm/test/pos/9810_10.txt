spoiler nothing but spoiler<br /><br />i have to add my name to the list of folks who feel that the other viewers just don't get it. but no one has even mentioned the "s" word so far as i have seen.<br /><br />while i agree that the kid died i think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. he races down the slope in an old wagon, shoots off the cliff and..."flies away". maybe the whole account of the form of death is allegory or maybe he does commit suicide in a wagon as laid out. in either case, he "flies away" (c'mon, not that tough a metaphor).<br /><br />maybe i just have a thing for tom hanks, but i was ok with the narration. besides he is raising $ for the ww2 memorial and you gotta love him for that.<br /><br />oh yeah, i loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.
