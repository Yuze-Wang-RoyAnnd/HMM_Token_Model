okay, so it starts very unimaginatively with a narration from the lead character (justine played by laura fraser - an amazing actress in her own right) but it goes on to become something miraculous. it has silly little things that you really shouldn't find funny but do every time. there is an especially memorable moment that sees your jaw dropping to the ground the first time you watch it when the male body of jake, containing justine's female mind, is trying to get used to her new anatomy. i wont spoil it for you, but the second time i watched it was with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. it makes you cringe, but laugh at the same time. i am also a big fan of the music used. there is a beautiful small band that appears randomly on the street or on a pathway every now and then, but also some gorgeous, yet unknown (often the best), pop songs. it has the feeling of being written for an english cast by an american writer, which does annoy me only a couple of times. overall, this film is hilarious. i am a massive fan of laura fraser's now, after being given his film for my birthday, and expect that, even though some of the cast are little-known to most, you too will enjoy every bit of it.
