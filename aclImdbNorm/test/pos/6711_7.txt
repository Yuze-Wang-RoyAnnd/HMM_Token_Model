lifeforce is an extremely schizophrenic movie, based on colin wilson`s novel the space vampires the script ignores most of the novel`s concepts and structure ( indeed it owes more to the quatermass serials than the novel ) but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film . and talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history , it`s though it was written in chapters by several different people. take for instance carlson , he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered brits and it`s this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film . and there`s plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to london in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill they`re flying over it .<br /><br />i could go on at great length about these plot holes but lifeforce is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you don`t use your brain . it`s good to see a sci-fi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldn`t get their hands on them . the special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good , there`s lots of action and stunts and lifeforce features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl . when mentioning lifeforce in conversation with males it`s always a race to say " seen the alien in lifeforce? she can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime " hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females<br /><br />" don`t worry . a naked girl can`t escape from here " can`t she ? pity<br /><br />
