i originally saw this on its premiere in the uk. i was mesmerised by it, and it had me in tears all throughout its duration. i taped it off the tv for safekeeping, but over the years, it's worn out. and tv never seem to show it. therefore it was a joy to find out that true movies own the copyright and were showing it on their channels. this time, i taped it onto a dvd, so i can enjoy it again and again.<br /><br />lucile fray (played magnificently by ann - margret) discovers she has cancer, and that it is terminal. her husband has arthritis, and, although he is loving, he is an alcoholic, and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone. therefore, she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies.<br /><br />the acting is top notch, the music beautiful, and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry!) if you ever get the chance, you would be silly to miss this. it is a wonderful film! a must see for everyone!!!
