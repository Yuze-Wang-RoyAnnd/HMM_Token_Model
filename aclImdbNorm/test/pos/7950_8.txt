how would you feel if you had only a few weeks left to live? this film helps you to know through the eyes of one guy who is faced with that situation. it is told with sympathy and without too much emotion. some might feel it rather slow - but i think that adds to the realism of the film. some might see it as a love story, but i think that is secondary to seeing his last days through his eyes. the loves of his life are part of the end of his life and give it more impact. low key and gentle, the film rolls out the story much as life does. without clich'es and with unexpected events set against a backdrop of getting by. if you like your films gently emotionally realistic this may be for you.
