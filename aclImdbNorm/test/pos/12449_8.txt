this is one of the most enjoyable teen movies i have ever seen (and that i wished was released to video). it was released the same year as another great comedy in which tim matheson played a role "animal house" (which is probably why it was overlooked). <br /><br />one of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack, which could have and should have been a formal label release. the soundtrack features a lesser-known 70's act named high inergy whose song "we are the future", played a marquee role in the movie's prom scene. i remember purchasing the group's album "steppin' out" as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents. <br /><br />the closing song is one of the best ballads i have ever heard, and i can still hear it in my head. i wish i knew the group's name so that i could look for it somewhere in cyberspace.<br /><br />if you liked films such as "over the edge" and "rich kids", i think this is one that you will enjoy as well.
