this type of show is not supposed to happen on television. this is the type of edginess usually reserved for independent film. this is what only hbo is supposed to do. fact is that denis leary has managed to come up with one of the best television shows ever, easily joining the ranks of the sopranos, oz, ed etc.. kudos the gang at abc for showing that nypd blue was not a fluke, and to mr. leary and his gang for creating a truly unique viewing experience. my only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... an hour would make it better, but i can't wait for the next episode!
