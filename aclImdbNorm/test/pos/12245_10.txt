a truly terrific, touching film. female melodrama at its finest, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. any woman can relate to the story because it's a classic: you're in love with "mr. right" but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head-over-heels in love. but of course, it's not that simplistic. the characters are real and all of the performances are perfect. the movie is hilarious as well, every scene skewers society. i'd recommend this film to anyone who loves a well-written screenplay of humor and melodrama. you can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. a great, underrated movie.
