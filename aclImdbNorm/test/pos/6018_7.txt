"gypsy" is possibly the greatest musical ever written, so it's too bad that it's film version was such a disappointment. to make up for that, we have this re-make which, if not flawless, is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical. the script is completely accurate, all the songs included, and the staging remains close to the original jerome robbins' staging. bette midler is a deft choice for rose, her singing and personality merman-esquire, and her acting splendid. peter reigert is a fine herby, if not a great singer, and cynthia gibb is a straight forward, natural louise. in truth, a live taping of the 1989 revival with tyne daly might have been a better idea, if only because "gypsy" is simply more exciting on stage, but this film is a fine translation of a great musical.
