hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night? can't find what your looking for? i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. good for the whole family. i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. it was brilliant, to say the least. bruce willis's acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. in my opinion, it's a must-see movie. and i don't think that about a lot of movies, believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that. it's clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done. excellent story, good acting, and again, overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
