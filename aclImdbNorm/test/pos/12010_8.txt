i was surprised as i watched this movie, how much it had 'encaptured' me. no the actors didn't act like typical 'hollywood' actors, but that's not always bad either, as this film proves. quite different from the disney standard, it is a refreshing turn none-the-less! they also give you a taste of what it was probably like without being 'educational'. a movie everyone should both see and enjoy. many people love arguing over 'accuracies' in any movie of this type, but just getting the basic idea has plenty to offer. mild gripe; east and west germany, viewed on any map, would have west germany on the left side, east to the right. the movie at times, sets you back slightly, because about half of the scenes have west germany on the right side of the screen, and other times on the left side. even during the same events, they shift back and forth. perhaps, just a little more consistency would have avoided this mild distraction. go see it!
