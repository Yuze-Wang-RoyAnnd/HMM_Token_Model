sam firstenberg's "ninja 3:the domination" mixes martial arts with "the exorcist" like horror.the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable,but the film works as a mindless action/martial arts flick.the fight scenes are well-choreographed and exciting,and the film is never boring.so forget stupid dialogue,lame acting and annoying soundtrack-grab some beer and check this one out!highly recommended!
