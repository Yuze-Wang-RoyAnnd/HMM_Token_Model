nice to see a comedy for grown ups. masterfully structured by aaron sorkin via mike nichols's own mastery. mr nichol's mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in "who's afraid of virginia woolf" to the sad and riveting julia roberts, clive owen, jude law and natalie portman in "closer". in "charlie wilson's war" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks, julia roberts, philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a point. hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness. amy adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. an insurmountable task that miss adams manages to surmount, beautifully. it is philip seymour hoffman's gus with a t, however, that monopolized my attention. his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us. someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together. hoffman is superb. the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions. a sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that?
