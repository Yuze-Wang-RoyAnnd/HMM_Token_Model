i was a little worried about actors and acting in italy then "le conseguenze dell'amore" and toni servillo came. it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen. paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years. the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie. toni please keep on acting in movies, you're for sure the coolest actor around today (and not just in italy, his performance deserves international acclamation). i rate this movie 9/10.
