frank sinatra starred in this odd little short from rko that is now in the public domain. the film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice plea for religious tolerance.<br /><br />the film begins with sinatra on stage singing. after leaving the stage, he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion. instead of yelling at the boys (or helping them for that matter), sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious toleration and equates prejudice with fascism. the kids seem to get the lesson but then, out of the blue, sinatra begins singing a song that, frankly (get it?), kids would have hated. he had a lovely voice but unfortunately i think this detracted from the excellent message he gave to the kids about tolerance. it's a case of a good message with too much singing--even if the guy singing is frank sinatra. it's also an interesting curio--a nice historical piece that is often overlooked...plus it's quite touching even if it seems a bit schmaltzy.
