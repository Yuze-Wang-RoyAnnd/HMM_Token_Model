this is a very amazing movie! the characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they weren't real people. being from the south, i thought judith ivey's character seemed especially real, and as everyone else has mentioned, she does an outstanding acting job. the characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real. <br /><br />one reviewer mentioned that the main character, alice, had no good reason to run away from home, which is true - she didn't have any moral or upstanding reason to run away, such as escaping child abuse, etc. i thought that she was just fed up with dead-end jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to florida where her friend lived the appealing and privileged life of a college student in miami. the actress shows alice's confusion, uncertainty, and questioning turn into decisiveness and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. the film also shows how alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options, causing her to panic, take action, and reach out for help. <br /><br />at first, the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or homemade movie, but in actuality it is very well done. the home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters, a part of their rv trip across the country. this is definitely a film worth seeing, although i don't quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heart-warming coming of age tale. it is rather vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad in the end.
