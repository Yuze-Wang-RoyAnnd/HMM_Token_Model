my husband and i watched this last night...it was wonderful....for once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. it moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. i adore tom wilkinson anyway. he has never made a bad movie as far as i'm concerned. the above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... the facial expressions are incredible. even the picturesque scenery is awesome. we have just finished watched all of the prime suspect series and i am convinced that the british have a way of capturing the audience. there is no doubt that i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of thorough entertainment.
