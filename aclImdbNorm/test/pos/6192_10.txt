the problem with this series is that it is too real. i am watching it on amazon "unbox" and having just finished episode 2 i hate, absolutely hate, fark, the leader of the cell. i cannot recall any television series ever having this emotional impact. remember the old tag line for horror movies "just keep telling yourself its only a movie"? well i find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its "only tv". but of course it isn't only tv is it? the possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the united states is certainly within the range of plausibility. that's what gives this program its vicious authenticity. and that's why i hate it so much.
