when i started watching "surface"for the first time i was hooked.it had everything i wanted in a show suspense,action,mystery,great plot,and a great cast of characters.my whole family loved to watch the show.it seems when there's a great show on tv the network usually cancels it like they seemed to do with this show.they go by the nielson rating system which i think is stupid because there is a lot of junk that they seem to watch which the networks keep on the air.if only there was a way for everyone to vote on a show then maybe the good shows won't get canceled.when i watch tv now i only watch good shows so right now thats not watching a whole lot of tv.i hope that the network brings the show back but when they make up there mind with a dumb decision they seem to stick to it.i hope there's a lot of people out there that feel the same way.
