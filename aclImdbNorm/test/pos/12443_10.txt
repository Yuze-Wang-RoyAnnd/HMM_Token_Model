from the golden period of british films, this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time. screened yesterday at my film society to a rapturous audience, i was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted (made in 1950!). it is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors britain has produced: margaret rutherford and alastair sim. adapted from a play by john dighton, this farce is briskly handled by director frank launder. the plot is simple: a ministry mistake billets a girls' school on a boys' school. i will always laugh when i think of this film.
