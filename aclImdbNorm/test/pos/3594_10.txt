what i enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of corfu, being greek i adore my country and i liked the flattering director's point of view. based on a true story during the years when greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, nazis and hardship. an italian soldier and a greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. nicholas cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love. i adored christian bale playing mandras the heroine's husband-to-be, he looks very very good as a greek, his personality matched the one of the greek patriot! a true fighter in there, or what! one of the movies i would like to buy and keep it in my collection...for ever!
