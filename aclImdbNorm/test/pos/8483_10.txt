jamie foxx did an incredible job playing ray charles. i loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie. when ray charles was little, he went blind and his mother didn't baby him. she was a strong woman who didn't treat him any different because he was blind. she made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life. his mother also sent him to school as well. then when ray charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics, sex and betrayal. when i am discouraged about something i can just think of this movie and it will inspire me.
