bridget fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but she had my attention in break up. it's true the story is missing critical details in several places, but i just kept scrutinizing fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn't let me down. the look in her eyes in the last scene, as she musters up courage to, literally, put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever. i believed her completely, possibly because i've known and admired several "tough broads" who survived similar abusive situations. and they did this without becoming man-haters, but that's my own hopeful projection of fonda's character at the break up.
