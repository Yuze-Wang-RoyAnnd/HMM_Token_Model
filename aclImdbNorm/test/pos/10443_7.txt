this movie was release when i was 15 and i could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed.<br /><br />that was over 24 years ago and i haven't seen the movie since. this time around i cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is.<br /><br />life is not always fair and the good guys don't always win in fact i think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls. also it doesn't matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you. girls/boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise. sometimes you just gotta let go and say next.<br /><br />gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for karen. this is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone.<br /><br />i remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics. the acting is not quite there compared with fast times at ridgemount high but it kicks ass over this movie simply because ftarh has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending. nice guys finish last!! gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive. we all know a david, fun guy who makes you laugh.<br /><br />some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life. some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them, especially at that age. i have experienced that first hand.<br /><br />great sound track too!! u2 "i will follow" - jesus is it that old??
