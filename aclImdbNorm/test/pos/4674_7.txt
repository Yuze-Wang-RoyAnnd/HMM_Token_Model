i went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies. but she enjoyed it. i missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through it is a story about edward norton and a crew stealing some gold, and norton deciding he wants it all to himself. then the people he betrayed want to get back at him. it is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that i need to see again... the whole way through. one of my top movies of the summer so far.<br /><br />a big help to the entertainment factor is seth green. i dont know anyone who doesnt like seth green, and he adds to the flavor. he plays a guy who says he created napster, and his roomate stole it from him. he is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />it was said that norton didn't want to do this film.. but if i were him, i would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />the only problem is that it is very predictable. any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />my biggest complaint with the film, is eddie nortons choice of facial hair. the thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
