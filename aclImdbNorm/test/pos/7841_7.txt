"the beguiled" is a strange work among clint eastwood's oeuvre. by 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies, not only westerns (the genre in which he first made his name) but also war films (such as "where eagles dare") and cop thrillers (such as "coogan's bluff"). yet although "the beguiled" takes place during wartime (the american civil war), and was made by don siegel who had earlier directed eastwood in "coogan's bluff" and was later the same year to direct him in "dirty harry", it is not an action film in the traditional sense. in most of his previous films eastwood had played an active role, but here his role is largely passive- his character, sergeant john mcburney, is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive. even while serving with his unit, mcburney played no active part in the conflict; he is a quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms, and was serving with the union forces as a medical orderly. <br /><br />the film is set in louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured mcburney being discovered by a young girl named amy and brought back to her boarding school. the school is a small one, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities, the headmistress, martha farnsworth, decides to shelter him and tend him, fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the confederacy's notoriously harsh prison camps. <br /><br />although mcburney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication, and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls, and he wins the affections of number of them, including miss farnsworth, her assistant edwina and carol, one of the older girls. even twelve year old amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him. in the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred, and miss farnsworth, rejected in favour of the sluttish carol, plots a terrible revenge. (interestingly, the one female to resist mcburney's blandishments is hallie, miss farnsworth's black slave, even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her). <br /><br />"the beguiled" has been described as an anti-war film, but this seems to me to be a misconception. the film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the civil war or of war in general. the only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the confederate cause. it would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war. <br /><br />at the beginning the school, set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion, seems like an island of peace amid the war. the building is in the classical style, associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of classicism. the film can be seen as falling within what has been called the "southern gothic" tradition in american film and literature. <br /><br />the film was not a great hit at the box office, possibly because eastwood was cast so much against type. it is not perhaps his best film, but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (in "play misty for me", his first film as director made the following year, he was again to play a "passive" character in danger from a vindictive female). there are some very good performances from the female members of the cast, particularly geraldine page as martha farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions. (there are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother). there are also good contributions from elizabeth hartman as the shy, repressed edwina, who falls in love with mcburney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young pamelyn ferdin as amy. (amy is an animal lover- a key moment in the film comes when mcburney kills her pet turtle- so it is interesting that in later life ferdin became an animal rights activist). the one character i was less keen on was jo ann harris's carol who seemed too modern, like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s. the film is notable for the emotionally intense "hothouse" atmosphere which siegel brings to it. this will not be a film which is to everyone's taste; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic. (judith crist called it a film for "woman haters and sadists"). others, however, may find it a compelling psychological drama. 7/10
