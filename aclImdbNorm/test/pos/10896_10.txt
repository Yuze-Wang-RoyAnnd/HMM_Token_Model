ever since i've been allowed to play goldeneye once again, it's been impossible to get my mind off it. i'm surprised i could have gone without it. it is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games of all time. i have never played any other shooting games, but i know that this one rules above all. most people blame it for too much violence, but i find that ridiculous. there may be a few graphic antics, but there's far worse out there.<br /><br />most importantly, it's fun. with an awesome arsenal of weapons such as the rc-p90 and the classic golden gun, you'll go through several challenging levels from the movie, completing crucial objectives and fending off swarms of guards. there are tons of awesome cheats to get and even two secret levels that you will only earn if you have the true skill. goldeneye is also one of the greatest multiplayer games ever as well. you can choose several characters from the movie, classic villains from old 007 movies (baron samedi, oddjob, may day, and jaws), and guards in the game. chances are you and your partner(s) will be laughing so hard as you blow each other away that you'll look like bart and lisa simpson watching an episode of the itchy and scratchy show. <br /><br />so if you don't have the game, don't rent it: just buy it. it's too good to be true. for cool goldeneye stuff, check out detstar.com's goldeneye website. every james bond lover will dig this game big time.
