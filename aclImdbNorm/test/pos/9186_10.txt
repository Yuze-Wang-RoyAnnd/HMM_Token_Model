i expected a good movie. what i got was an even better movie. the chemistry between james and smith is just incredible. glad to see him in a major motion picture for once!<br /><br />the movie works, because the actors play their parts perfectly. will smith is fantastic with his never ending charm; kevin james is hilarious, and eva mendes...well, let's just say she plays that bitch/sweet/annoying role to the best of her ability.<br /><br />what i loved about the movie was the fact that will smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. he just was!! the "date doctor" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect of ways, and never ever went over the top.<br /><br />the funny parts are hilarious...and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable.<br /><br />i totally recommend this movie. and no, it is not a chick flick.
