i believe anyone who enjoyed eisentein's ivan the terrible movies would enjoy this well crafted movie. this movie played out like "lord of the ring: return of the king", but without the special effect but as good and better drama.<br /><br />we have the german, who dressed like kkk, conquered novgorod of russia. the russian summoned nevsky to lead them to fight the german to save russia. nikolai cherkasov, who played ivan in the ivan the terrible films, was charismatic as nevsky. the first 10 min how he handled the passing by mongol was captivating.<br /><br />many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white. the anticipation of war did not require any dialogue such as "how many enemy we will be killing", etc. except for a few speeches, the film can basically be played out as a silent film. the fighting scene can hold up to those of the civil war fighting scene of the birth of a nation.<br /><br />another strength of the movie is the great musical score, by sergei prokofiev. the music gave an epic feel to the movie in those scenes without dialogue.
