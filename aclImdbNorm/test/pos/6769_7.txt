send them to the freezer. this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive.
