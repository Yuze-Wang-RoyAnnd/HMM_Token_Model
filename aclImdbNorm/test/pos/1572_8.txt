this is a low budget, well acted little gem. alice, a small town massachusetts teenager, fed up with her existence, takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market. she sets out for florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at miami. after her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an rv who also happen to be traveling to florida.. the couple, brilliantly played by judith ivy and bill raymond are overly hospitable and, it turns out, a prostitute and and her pimp. slowly, alice is lured into truck stop prostitution as the rv meanders down the thruway in the general direction of florida. through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about alice and her desire to leave tiny milford. we also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and alice all seem quite credible. an excellent, well made film that you will think about when it is over.
