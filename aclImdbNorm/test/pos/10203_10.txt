here's another of the 1940's westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc, because although it may be flawed historically, it is extremely entertaining and well acted, plus it's got randolph scott, my favorite actor second only to gary cooper-well, ok, fourth behind coop, charlton heston, and gregory peck. but the film itself, to me anyway, is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before, well acted and "flows" very well-i bet i've seen it 50 or 60 times, and enjoy each viewing more than the one before. i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd. see it if you haven't- i guarantee you'll like it!
