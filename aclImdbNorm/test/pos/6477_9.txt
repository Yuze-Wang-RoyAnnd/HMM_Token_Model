it's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the american public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed. but knute rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure catholic college on the map.<br /><br />i've heard clips of rockne's famous pep talks and it is uncanny how pat o'brien got the voice and the inflection perfectly. in what turned out to be his career role, pat o'brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was rockne. rockne is assisted by well by gale page as bonnie stiles rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for notre dame, but never threw anyone out of her house.<br /><br />rockne's first impact on football was as a player with notre dame not a coach. one fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored army, rockne and team mate gus dorais played by owen davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense. rockne didn't invent the forward pass, but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that. <br /><br />rockne knew how to work the media also. those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players. they were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that golden age of sports in the roaring twenties. <br /><br />playing a small, but key role is ronald reagan. as george gipp, the first player rockne coached to achieve greatness, reagan not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career. that deathbed scene which rockne swore was accurate became a republican battle cry as many a gop underdog went out to win one for the gipper.<br /><br />i still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering president ronald reagan at notre dame's graduation with his old friend pat o'brien. reagan always credited o'brien and dick powell of all the warner brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.<br /><br />notre dame itself owes its prestige to rockne. it's quite possible that notre dame would be an obscure small catholic college without the reputation that football brought to it.<br /><br />though george gipp and the later famous backfield of the four horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was rockne who had the reputation. it's no accident that warner brothers was able to get amos alonzo stagg, glenn 'pop' warner, howard jones, and william spaulding, rockne's contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in knute rockne, all american. it was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.<br /><br />i think more than football fans will enjoy knute rockne, all american. though you might become one after seeing the film.
