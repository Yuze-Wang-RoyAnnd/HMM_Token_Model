my 2nd favorite film of 1970 (after five easy pieces) was totally dismissed by a lot of idiots, calling in an audience-baiting piece of trash. peter boyle, a well-known liberal, is incredible as the hard-assed working stiff who has a few problems with the younger generation. he's a frightening dude, but has a great imagination and is very funny. i was a teenage liberal when this was released, but as horrifying as joe seemed to me, he also cracked me up! susan sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a mixed-up stone rich fox. the dinner scene in queens is hilarious and insightful for everybody involved.<br /><br />this was not an exploitation film and the script (which was oscar-nominated) should have won that year. the director just didn't waste enough money making it to give it enough credibility in hollywood. no matter your political pursuasion, then and now, you'll like somebody in this film. a definite 9 out of 10. it's on dvd and video. check it out!
