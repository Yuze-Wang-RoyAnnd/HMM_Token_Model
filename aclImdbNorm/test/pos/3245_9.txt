a gritty australian film, with all the elements for success. two hands represents the ability of australian film makers and actors to produce top-quality, popular material. the film has a fresh angle, and uniquely incorporates drama, suspense and comedy.<br /><br />i found this film thoroughly enjoyable on so many different levels - but can also appreciate that it might not be everyone's 'cup of tea'. the film carries a distinct aussie humour, as it portrays the seedy underworld of sydney, and explores the lives of a young man (ledger) and young woman (byrne), swept up in the local crime scene.<br /><br />two hands deals with the theme of good and evil, both on an interpersonal and personal level and looks at the issue of consequences for 'our' actions.<br /><br />the camera work is snazzy and the dialogue humorous. with bryan brown who plays pando and heath ledger as jimmy, battling it out on-screen in the most bizarre situations - this aussie film is certainly not short of acting talent.<br /><br />this subtle action/comedy has become somewhat of a cult favourite, and one of mine also.
