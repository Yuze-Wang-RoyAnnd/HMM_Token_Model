i still can't describe what to feel when i received this by the fnac site. such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now i hold a dvd of the movie, with the finest quality possible. as i did in atlantis, the other rare besson movie i bought by the internet, i saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. i didn't know what to expect. wickedly, i always searched some kind of disappointment when i saw a film by luc besson i never had seen before. but it never came. this movie was no exception. from the start, i understood that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to be big in the future. and so it happened. this won several prizes (including the highest prize in a film festival of my country, which makes me proud) and it shows that this movie is preparating many bigger things. this may be the most original after-the-war movie i have ever seen, beating mad max in originality and artistic feel. there is not a problem with this movie: its cinematography is genius, as well the perfomances of the actors. i am also proud to say that finally i saw all the movies of my favorite director, and have a copy of almost all of them (joan of arc is still waiting for me to buy the dvd). this movie is most of all a work of style and dedication, which makes clear why luc besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent use of music (i also marveled at eric serra's first feature-length score) and the promise of great achievements. gaumont did well to bet in its boy-genius, the man who would later change the face of france's and europe's relation between movies and their public. let's hope besson starts working in a new directorial project. i will be the first to cheer it. until then, i recommend this movie to anyone who need to learn a lesson of how good movies are made with little money. i loved the atmosphere of the movie, which, by its black and white cinematography, suggests us an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust. this movie works by the sheer magic of movies: showing in pictures what we can't explain by words. and i'm with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and liked it: good choice! a great hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a little of their lives were changed.
