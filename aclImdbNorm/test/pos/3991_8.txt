warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.<br /><br />the artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. but, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. late in the film, his being annoying, abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished. while all this didn't make him a particularly nice man, it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist.<br /><br />i really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie (like in lust for life). i really wish i could show this to my students (i teach at a school for the arts), but can't because there is just too much adult material. yes there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (particularly younger ones) is when he,....hmmm,...i don't think imdb will even let me describe what occurred, but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids. not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did not need to be seen, but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film. it's a real shame.
