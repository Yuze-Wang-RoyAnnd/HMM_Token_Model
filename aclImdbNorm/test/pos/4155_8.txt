"nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the u.s. as "the golden door") was written and directed by emanuele crialese. this film is different--and, i think, better--than most movies about impoverished people who leave europe and come to the united states.<br /><br />the film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of sicily. we always hear that sicily is a rocky island, but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half-hour of "the golden door." <br /><br />the middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the u.s. most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third-class section becoming seasick, and then show us the statue of liberty. not this movie--we get a sense for life below decks, and it isn't charming. (we never actually see the statue of liberty, either.) <br /><br />finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of ellis island, and then the immigrants are walking through new york's lower east side. not here--the ellis island experience occupies about one-third of the footage. <br /><br />vincenzo amato is outstanding as salvatore mancuso, who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world. charlotte gainsbourg is equally good as lucy reed, a mysterious englishwoman who also speaks fluent italian.<br /><br />there are some strange touches in the movie, especially the sound track with songs by nina simone. there must be some symbolism there, but i couldn't make sense of it.<br /><br />another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on dvd. still, large screen or small screen, it's worth seeking out.
