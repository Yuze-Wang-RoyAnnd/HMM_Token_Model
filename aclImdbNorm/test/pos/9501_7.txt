no more corned beef and cabbage for her!<br /><br />this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). all of this is centered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by gloria swanson (she is twenty here!). both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. <br /><br />behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. there's a little corniness, but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. as with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or raciness). and there is that higher purpose here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. <br /><br />if you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you won't find it here. but as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. the events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. and did i saw swanson was perfect?
