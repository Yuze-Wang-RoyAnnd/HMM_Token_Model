i was surprised by how emotionally invested i became in this film. peter boyle is a tour de force as the working class socially conservative bigot, joe. i actually sympathized with some of his complaints. of course he doesn't mention the underlying historical socio-economic reasons for many of his prejudices. the film also provides interesting insight into the rapid change american society was undergoing at this time. recreational drugs, casual sex, and the challenging of parental authority became in vogue and replaced the more time honored traditions of respect for god, country and seniority. susan sarandon fans will be delighted. joe is her film debut. she also provides viewers with a visual treat near the beginning of the film. recommended, 8/10.
