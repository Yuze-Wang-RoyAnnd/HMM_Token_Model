the mascot is ladislaw starewicz's masterpiece. it tells the tale of a stuffed toy dog who searches for an orange after he overhears the mother tell her daughter she hasn't any money. the dog gets picked with other toys to be sold off. in the truck, after the others jump off while the vehicle runs, the dog stays and waits to be picked up from store before setting off on his own. he manages to get orange after biting woman's leg as she was holding and selling the fruit. as he runs, he encounters the devil and accepts his offer to stop at nightclub. there, he meets the other toys who jumped off truck. the cat who was next to him in vehicle is especially determined to get dog's orange. i'll just stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in nightclub that you'll have to see for yourself. suffice it to say, if you love starewicz and is interested in all animation from the past, i most definitely recommend you seek this one out!
