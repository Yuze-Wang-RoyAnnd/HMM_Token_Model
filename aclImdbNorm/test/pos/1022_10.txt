i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was. the school play where the leading actors kiss, that happened at my school. a crazy gang of lads, my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke! 'getting the whack', some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes! after that they were kept in a safe!!! and as for certain nocternal activities! what can i say.... the film actually came out in 1982, i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time. if you like british films and films about school, growing up and period pieces, then this is for you. another film very much like it, 'swalk', came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again, also 'kes' is in the genre. highly recommended. (but trust me, 1982 is when it came out)
