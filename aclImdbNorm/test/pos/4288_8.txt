if we could have "separate tables," why not "separate lies."<br /><br />this becomes somewhat involved. a housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. the culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. the latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. to complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. sounds like she wants revenge.<br /><br />this all becomes convoluted. when our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she recants her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case.<br /><br />as if this isn't enough, several months later, our lover (rupert everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (emily watson) leaves her husband (tom wilkinson) to care for him.<br /><br />the acting is quite good here despite the never-ending "peyton place" like theme. tom wilkinson, is a solicitor, who tries to protect his wife.<br /><br />the film is a good one, but we could have done without the terminal illness. o well, the marriage ended anyway.
