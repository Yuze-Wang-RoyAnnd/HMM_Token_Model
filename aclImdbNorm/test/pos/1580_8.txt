this movie, i would like to say, was completely great. i can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film. this isn't completely untrue, but it's as much of shocker fiction as chuck palahniuk's books are. one of my favorite movies of all time, bijo no harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to. it's scary, funny, silly, gross, full of off-the-top material and to some people, arousing. the fist time i saw this, it was with my friend, and his mother had brought it home for him to see it. he said it was just some screwed up japanese movie, but i saw so much more of it. it's badly made, yes, but it has a certain type of poignancy as to be beautiful, too. as the director says himself, this is a shocker movie made for a certain reason. its like atrophy. if you leave audiences soft, then the entire human race is going to be soft. i think this is a good philosophy, and i agree with it one-hundred percent. bijo no harawata is the type of movie that gang rapes the hell out of fitness, yogurt, and all of this new-wave stuff.
