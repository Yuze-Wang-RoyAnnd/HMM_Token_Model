there are lot of similarities between never say never again and thunderball not only on sean connery but also the story and plot. except the actors all other are same like hijacking atomic bombs, asking for ransom, trafficking nukes in a ship, etc only difference are place of occurrence in thunder ball plot it is in bahamas in never say never again it is over north africa. and in thunder ball the nato / raf itself loads the nukes into plane and in never say never again it is changed by an "rouge arm of the axe" and air dropped over us and stolen in caribbean. almost 99% is same.if anybody wants to dispute this they are most welcome.
