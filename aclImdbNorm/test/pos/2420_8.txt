i read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous karate kid installments. although my favorite is still karate kid ii, i felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. maggi finds this a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. the plot twists are believable and predictable. i found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional, but this weakness is present in all the installments in varying degrees. the camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time. the zen monastery is both austere and charming. the zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow. i liked the "zen bowling" scenes which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious zen archery scene earlier on. the quality level of the movie is like a good tv series. the music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the little river band playing "listen to your heart". the lessons in the movie are valuable and worthwhile to learn. they feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to over-glorify the fighting part. all in all, i enjoyed it.
