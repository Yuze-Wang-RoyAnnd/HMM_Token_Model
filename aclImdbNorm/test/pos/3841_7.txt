i have seen this movie only once, several years ago. but i remember liking it a lot.<br /><br />**spoilers ahead** an old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune. he puts knockout drops in their milk. when they wake up, they find themselves miles away. they must journey back to their house before it is too late. with the help of an independent-minded tomcat and other animal accomplices, while evading the butler and foiling his plan.<br /><br />could have been better, but it also could have been a lot worse.<br /><br />my score: 7/10.
