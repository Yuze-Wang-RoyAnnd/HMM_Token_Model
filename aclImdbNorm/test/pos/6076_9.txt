was curious to know the name of the tuscan village where the filming in italy was done. i know the villa's name: villa san girolamo, however, would like to know the exact location in tuscany. the cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit that area. i would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is as well. travel extensively in europe and africa and would am interested in visiting the areas that the book and film were about. please e-mail me with any information on the sites that any one might have. we would be very grateful. and if any one knows if the villa in tuscany is still habitable, that would be awesome as well. i await any information and i thank you in advance for your time.
