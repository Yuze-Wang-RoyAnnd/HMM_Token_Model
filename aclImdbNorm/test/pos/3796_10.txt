i rarely write reviews but this film simply demands more attention than it gets as it contains the most hysterical kidnapping gone comically wrong sequence ever filmed.<br /><br />i have only seen this once and found it to be the funniest film i had ever had the privilege to watch. i laughed from beginning to end. it is such a shame it is not out on dvd or video.<br /><br />you can only compare its cinematography with that of it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world or promise her anything. only this storyline isn't nearly as complex as mad world.<br /><br />i hope in the near future this film is released as it would be a shame to lose such a comedy gem amongst the dregs we have nowadays.
