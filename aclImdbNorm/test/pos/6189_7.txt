sleeper cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism/patriotic muslim americans), and it does neither very well.<br /><br />i had put off watching this show for a very long time, because i had a feeling it would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, i finally moved it up to the front.<br /><br />the show is about an undercover muslim man working for the fbi in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the united states. the undercover agent in the show actually is a muslim, so we see his conflict/resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. personally i would have rather watched a drama about a muslin american family living in the united states, but it is doubtful that an america tv channel (cable or network) will ever produce anything that shows muslims in a flattering light.<br /><br />i am not a muslim, but i have a lot of muslim american friends, and i can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love america.<br /><br />sleeper cell comes close to busting stereotypes of muslims, but it also focuses on the worse muslim stereotypes. in the first episode we see an "honor killing," which is a very poor portrayal of islam, but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards others.<br /><br />if only the moderate muslim scholar had been the main character of the show.<br /><br />americans need to learn a lot more about islam, sleeper cell helps a little bit, but it comes up far short of giving the america audience what it really needs to knows.<br /><br />that said, the acting in this show is superb, and the drama is extremely engrossing. if only they had made this show about islam in america without the terrorism, it would have been first rate.
