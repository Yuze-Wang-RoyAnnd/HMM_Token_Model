this is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. why? it has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have. over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. in other words, dolemite is a must-see.<br /><br />as with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. what i picked up from it is that pimp-hustler dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics. while he was doing time, his arch nemesis willie green (the same man who framed him) took over his nightclub. however, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the whole movie that isn't completely evil or incompetent) decides to spring him free to stop the evil willie green and his drug trafficking. luckily, he knows kung fu, as does about 50 to 75% of the characters in this film do. and even more luckily, while he was locked up, the madam queen bee sent all his "hoes" to kung fu school. with this army of kung fu fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from willie green. however, two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail.<br /><br />as i said earlier, don't try to follow the plot. i've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else. supporting characters wander in and out of the film. i'm still attempting to figure out what was up with reverend gibbs, the mayor, and the hamburger pimp. who cares ultimately? the scenes with these characters are all priceless. as for the dialog, its horrible with even worse delivery. since rudy ray moore was originally a comedian, i begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film. it seems he couldn't decide which one. lines such as "yeah, i'm so bad, i kick my own ass twice a day" call for further investigation. either way, the film is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory. another hilarious element is some of the most unerotic uses of sex and nudity ever in film. actors that you would never want to see naked get naked (including the mayor and queen bee). not to mention the fact that the boom mic seems to show up in every other scene.<br /><br />most of all, moore shows incredible enthusiasm. he seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic. his comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap, including dr. dre who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album "the chronic". as technically inept as the film is, it is culturally influential. even more important, it is an all around good time. the biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring, and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining. in other words, if you dig this kind of film, you'll love "dolemite". if you don't dig it, you're a "no-business, born-insecure, jock-jawed motha-f***a!"
