while it comes no closer to the tarzan of edgar rice burroughs than, say, the johnny wiesmuller flicks did it does have it's own peculiar, and entertaining, slant on the story. its a well done tarzan movie. nice scenery, good photography, workable continuity, and a tarzan yell that echos the one described by burroughs. the players all perform well. the only bad points i found were, i think, related. it moves slow in places. that slow movement? makes this picture to long. it could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which i think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development. but the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick. short version of all the above ... its a very good tarzan movie.
