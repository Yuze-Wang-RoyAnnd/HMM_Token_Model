we still really love the movie and soundtrack "valley girl". i have owned it on video for eons and wore out the original soundtrack. i have several friends with whom i get together and we have "80's raves" - parties where we get together and play 80's music and run "valley girl" on the big screen - and we're all in our 30's now. we have an awesome time.<br /><br />it's all in good fun, like, ya know?
