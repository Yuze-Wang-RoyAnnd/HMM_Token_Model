i first saw this movie when i was very little. i was born in 1985, so it was around the age when 80s cartoons were big. my mother taped it one day thinking i might like it. i had never even heard of the rainbow bright tv show before i was introduced to the movie. when i saw it (on one of those old beta tapes...) i loved it. i became addicted to it. there are people who say it's badly written and all that, but it's a kid's movie, and things like that don't matter much to children. i loved the story, and especially liked the songs and all the female characters. of course i pretended to be them, and in the scene where rainbow first met krys and they were repulsed they had to work with the opposite sex, i could totally relate. the story was the basic good vs. evil that children enjoy, and there were enough happy moments to balance out the scary ones. the world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of any young child. i am very glad i had an opportunity to see this movie when i was little. it made a big impact, and watching it now brings back happy memories of childhood. i would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie. it will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment. you're only a child once, so don't let them miss out on this one!
