intruder in the dust (1949) dir: clarence brown <br /><br />production: mgm<br /><br />excellent 'southern gothic' tale, adapted from the faulkner novel, about a black man, accused of the murder of a white man, who asks a young white boy he has befriended to help him prove his innocence. lucas beauchamp (juano hernandez) is something of an anomaly in this small town. he's a black man who owns the land he lives on and doesn't think much of the diseased social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in many similar small towns. so when lucas is found holding a gun over the dead body of vinson gowrie, shot in the back no less, young chick mallison (claude jarman) (who lucas once saved after chick fell through the ice while hunting on his land) fears that the town finally has the chance to "make lucas a n*****." arrested, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night is through, lucas reaches out to chick for help, as the only person he knows "not cluttered with notions". chick asks his uncle john, a lawyer, to defend lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against the gathering mob to save lucas' life.<br /><br />the film has an uncommon frankness for its time and is mostly free of moralizing. the lawyer character has a tendency to speak incredibly self-aware dialogue that sounds mostly like something from the printed page, but it has minimal impact on the tone. that's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else. juano hernandez, who had mostly appeared in oscar micheaux films, is superb as the proud lucas. porter hall as the murdered man's father, in maybe the best role i've ever seen him in, and elizabeth patterson as a plucky old lady sympathetic to lucas' case, standout in support roles. the setting is perfectly realized. it is actually filmed in oxford, mississippi, faulkner's hometown. brown also uses the crowd in an effective way, it's always an anonymous mob against a single person (like lucas when he's arrested or john when he's going up to his office), that is very threatening. or the grotesquerie of the whole town gathering at the jailhouse to witness the lynching like it was a parade. of note is an absolutely riveting scene when chick and his friend aleck go evidence gathering in a cemetery. robert surtees (the bad and the beautiful, thirty seconds over tokyo, ben-hur) shot the picture. <br /><br />*** 1/2 out of 4
