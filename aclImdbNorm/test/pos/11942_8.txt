i gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10. it had an excellent plot, and peter coyote and michele lee, as well as the rest of the cast, did their parts well.<br /><br />both peter and michele were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the film, obviously would have been better suited being their grandchildren.<br /><br />i missed the first ten minutes of this film, so i don't know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got traced back to denny traynor (peter coyote's character), but i had no difficulty picking up on the storyline.<br /><br />barbara traynor (michele lee) is stunned when her long-time husband, denny is arrested for a murder in oregon some 25 years previous, a state denny claims he was never in.<br /><br />however, as evidence piles up against denny, his story changes. then his story changes again and yet again, until barbara doesn't know what to believe.<br /><br />barbara makes up her mind, however, to get to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time denny and a young girl named sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named wayne kennedy, that ended in murder.<br /><br />i found the film entertaining, well paced, and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three people.<br /><br />from what i saw during the closing credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.
