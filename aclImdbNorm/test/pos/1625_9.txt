as a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining true to the source materials, and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work. the intrigues translate well to film by virtue of ron howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity.<br /><br />i like hanks as robert langdon. his portrayal is genuine and earthy, with only the barest glint of the kip we all knew and loved, back in "the day." he is a good dramatic actor and, while i miss his comedic efforts, i do enjoy his more serious performances.<br /><br />the subject matter is no less controversial than the davinci code, and the vatican seems to never learn their lesson. as with the aforementioned film, the holy see issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global catholic boycott of the film, which of course, generated millions in ticket sales.<br /><br />although the story of the "god particle" was played down dramatically, and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left, was entertaining and extremely well done. and, the truth be known, people who have not read the book, will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story, as the screen version carries the main story well on its own.<br /><br />in fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise, in order to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, although that does not lessen the effectiveness, nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work.<br /><br />all in all, this is good for a friday/saturday night's viewing, although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones.<br /><br />it rates an 8.8/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
