"nuovomondo" was a great experience. many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. emanuele crialese directs his film very visually driven. for everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. particularly european cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young us-american directors are strongly influenced by that). crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me. it has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour. vincenzo amato is outstanding as family head salvatore, as well as the amazing charlotte gainsbourg, who i enjoy watching in every single one of her movies. there are many great sequences in this movie. just to pick one: when the ship leaves italy and the people just quietly stare. this scene is great, particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it (titanic!).
