deep water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. the testimony and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late 1960's and a ground-breaking round the world yacht race. the personal conflicts of duty to family, self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films i have seen. i was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. the story is mostly respectful to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than ruthlessly exposed. most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters. this movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful suspense, joy and drama.
