james stewart plays dr. ben mckenna, who, with his wife and son, are tourists in an arabian city. they get caught up in the middle of a murder scene. the victim whispers something in dr. mckenna's ear, and he is told to do something.<br /><br />later, his son is kidnapped. the kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew, but the woman is a bit softer than the man.<br /><br />the song, "que, sera, sera" (whatever we'll be, we'll be," is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie.<br /><br />doris day play's stewart's wife, and she sings the song mentioned above. her performance is oscar worthy. i'm surprised she wasn't even nominated.<br /><br />my score: 8/10.
