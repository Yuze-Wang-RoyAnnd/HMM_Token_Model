sadly, every single person i ask about this series says they've never heard of it. i remember it fondly from my early childhood (i wasn't quite 10 when it came out).<br /><br />my favorite story was "a story short". something about the way the "stone soup" story was woven into a greater story gets me every time. and then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell, and it becomes a story itself. i've always been a fan of jim henson, and this is just one reason why.<br /><br />i'm adding this dvd on the self with labrynth, the dark crystal, the neverending story, the princess bride, the last unicorn, willow and mirrormask. these are all dvds i share with my siblings who are 6, 5, and 4 yrs old.
