from the opening sequence, filled with black and white shots reminiscent of gordan parks photos, this film draws the viewer into a feeling of artistic renaissance. the backdrop of a poetry cafe aptly named, "the sanctuary," provides just that. the jazz that permeates the film and the cinematography will seduce you.<br /><br />this story of love actually allows love to grow, to evolve, and ultimately mature, a rarity in hollywood. everyone can identify with some stage of their journey towards each other. this tale of two artist that just can't quite get it together sparked a debate amongst its viewers. should she have gone away? should he have stopped her? who knows...?<br /><br />starring larenz tate(darius lovehall), and nia long(nina moseley) with a scene stealing performance by isiah washington(savon) and lisa nicole carson(josie nichols) as the ultimate best friend, this film is a romantic jewel.<br /><br />see this one with someone you love (wink).
