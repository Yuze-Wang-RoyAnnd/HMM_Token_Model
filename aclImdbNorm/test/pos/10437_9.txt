i saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago. if you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves. it is a little like american pie meets fast times at ridgemont high but with more depth. it handles the same issues as both movies, but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth. the ending is sad, but that is how life is. i think everyone should see it. i have it on dvd form, and it took such a long time to find it too. that should say something, heh and another thing i will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack. i believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing. it has songs by artists like the commodores, u2, devo, reo speedwagon, the cars, kc and the sunshine band, and many more.
