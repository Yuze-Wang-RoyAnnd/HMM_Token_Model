wow, i think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low. there's really no reason to dislike this film. "michael" is a simple, but fairly original, and easily enjoyable romantic comedy. the plot involves a group of reporters/experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (john travolta) in the midwest. the angel proves to be less saintly and more worldly than we would expect, and that's what makes it entertaining. his interest in women and the beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing. the romantic side of this film involves michael the angel trying to get andie macdowell and william hurt together. the two of them may not have the all-time greatest on-screen chemistry, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. everyone who has rated this film so low (a 5.4??), come on! the film is not that bad. in fact, i found it quite funny and memorable. sure, it's not the best thing you'll ever see, but it's still good. this is a film i feel has been remarkably underrated. it's fun, romantic, and recommended by me.<br /><br />*** out of ****
