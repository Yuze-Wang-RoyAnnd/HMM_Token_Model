there was a video out in america called 'cartoon scandals' that featured about an hours worth of banned cartoons.<br /><br />most of them were wwii era. that's where i first saw (and heard of) this one.<br /><br />the rooster during the opening news broadcast turns into a vulture with an asian face saying 'cock-a-doodle-doo please.' after that it's eight minutes of propaganda played out like a newsreel.<br /><br />viscously racist, but when you look at it as the piece of history it is, it can (and should) be forgiven.<br /><br />slicing ration cards to make sandwiches.<br /><br />showing the ruins of rome while calling moussolini 'ruin #1.'<br /><br />a minesweeper using a broom.<br /><br />a manned bomb with the pilot saying 'ret me out of here.' <br /><br />and of course the stereotyping. every japanese was drawn with big teeth, constantly bowing, and saying 'please' at the end of every broken sentence.<br /><br />the funniest bit? the air raid siren that was two bowing men stabbing each other in the tush with pins. "oooo-oooooo" <br /><br />hey aol. let this one out. it deserves notice. my wife laughed at this. and she's 100% japanese.
