my favorite show of all time! yeah, i thought this was so cool, and larisa oleynik was the first crush i ever had (aaaawwwwww). it was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. but since we couldn't afford to keep nick, i couldn't see any episodes after feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should. to me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!) of having to say "goodbye" to someone that you love, and know you'll never see them again. and i still think that, because as far as i know, there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soon...yeah, life is mean! i've found that out for sure (though you can find an odd episode every here or there...but i never liked the bootleg copies of things much either).<br /><br />so enough of my sad life:(....most kids in 7th grade don't need powers like alex gets to get them through life (unrealistic--for sure) but then again, how many towns have a super-evil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for "progress at any cost"? gee this show was fun to watch! though i'd agree the diaglouge is a bit over developed (and even a little politically correct sometimes). my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant (a video tape or something like that) like a kid's version of "tom clancy's rainbow six" (which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason) almost! then you've got the plant's "security" team who are trying desperately to find the "kid from the accident"...very mean dudes (at least when i first watched the show...they seem more sympathetic to me now). i feel rather sad for larisa oleynik, not sure if she minds this role type-casting her.....but it's what i'll always remember her by.<br /><br />oh and btw, the actor that plays aaron peirce from "24" is on here too as a school coach or something....too cool! maybe he can get the producers of that show to get larisa in next season of "24". i only bring it up 'cuz jack bauer is my other tv hero and i'd just love to see cross-over things, lol:). both are set in california, so i'll just keep on dream'n...i can see it now, "let me alone with that suspect for a few minutes....no, i don't need a car battery!"
