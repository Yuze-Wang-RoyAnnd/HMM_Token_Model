this was an interesting movie...half-comedy, half-political thriller. it had a lot of good elements, although it was a little predictable. <br /><br />robin williams stars as tom dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives political commentary. think daily show with john stuart. during the taping of one of his shows, a female in the audience tells him he should run for president. that, followed by a few jokes taken seriously, were all that was needed to get the ball rolling and start dobbs' political career. <br /><br />he runs independently, and opposes democrats and republicans equally. he is straightforward and honest, and becomes increasingly popular--but maybe not popular enough to actually win. he's clearly the underdog in this election. <br /><br />meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much quicker and easier for the common people--but there is a glitch. the glitch is discovered by a young lady named elanor (linnley) who is appeased by the software developer with a lie that he fixed the glitch before the upcoming election. <br /><br />election day comes around, and lo and behold dobbs is declared the winner. (big surprise!) elanor knows that he is not really the president--he didn't win legitimately--she decides to tell the president...but complications arise. her company went as far as poisoning her in order to silence her. in addition to that, she quickly takes a liking to dobbs. <br /><br />the plot takes a few twists and turns, before reaching it's slightly predictable conclusion. but, it never got boring. robin was great as usual, and christopher walken often stole the show as dobbs' manager-turned-political-adviser and best friend. <br /><br />it's an entertaining film, and it has a good message. i recommend it if you're in the mood for dark satire, or something that makes you think. overall i give it a 7/10.
