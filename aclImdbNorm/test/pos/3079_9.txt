this movie is wonderful! i can watch it again and again. robin hood is perfectly cast, and marian is beautiful. i personally think marian's german man is the funniest character, along with latrine and the sheriff! while space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! w o n d e r f u l this was a great film, and never gets boring. a great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again! you will love this film if you'll only watch it, except if you hate comedy, or does not think robin hood should be tampered with. but this old story gets boring, and this movie gives it a great new flavor!
