i know what you're saying, "oh man, pinochio is not scary!" but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal pinochio. behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll pinnochio who seems to talk to her. the only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her. in the end is shocking revelation that, as did i, will shock you. watch it. give it a try.
