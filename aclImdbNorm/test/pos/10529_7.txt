this bbc version of an agatha christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely. christie's books tend to move at a gentle, sometimes even sedate pace, and "evans" is one that certainly does. it also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot. this version is extremely faithful to the book, which results in a very slow, involved story. as a christie fan, i gave it 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to make its way through a relatively action-free story. i appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the bbc did for its later christie productions much more.<br /><br />in the end, this movie is a leisurely pleasure, highlighted by the breathy waif francesca annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off james warwick very well.
