i'm glad they finally released it on dvd. i bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year.<br /><br />grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success. its formula is certainly not original, but it's very funny nonetheless. i am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings.<br /><br />it ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. it's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. and sometimes, that's all a movie is meant to be.
