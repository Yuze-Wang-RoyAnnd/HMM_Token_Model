in 2004, i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie: <br /><br />***** to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule. i think in many ways "the best years of our lives" is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid-1940s after wwii. i believe "coming home" and "the deer hunter", both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in "the best years of our lives".<br /><br />what really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.<br /><br />this movie still packs a wallop and i'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****<br /><br />i'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on imdb and afi. also, though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic, it's a wonderful life, arguably, the best years of our lives' oscar wins, including best picture, were very well-deserved. <br /><br />i've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, the best years of our lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture.
