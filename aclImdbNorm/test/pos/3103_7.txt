the film begins with a cranky old broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor richard carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. however, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). however, while this seems like bad and contrived writing, it is not....as this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot. however, part-way through the ruse, the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny. what no one realizes, though, is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot--making for some wonderful twists and turns. so when it seems that there is a real murder, the actors are truly terrified while carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. while i have explained some of the plot, there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself--and it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing.<br /><br />considering that this is a b-movie in the public domain, i certainly did not have very high hopes for this little film. however, i was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick--with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clich'ed plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. plus, while the plotting of the film was very good, the dialog was even better--with lots of sparkling wit and a nice light-hearted pace. full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.
