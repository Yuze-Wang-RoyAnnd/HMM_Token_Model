this movie is amazing. you will never laugh harder. it's a target. no, i think it's...yes it's...a boob! this movie gets funnier by the second--like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! congrats if you buy or rent this. you'll never return it, in my opinion. i didn't, and i haven't found it in a store since. i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung-fu action flicks. if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects...this is not that movie. if you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment, pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. with friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.
