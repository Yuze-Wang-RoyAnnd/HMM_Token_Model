i usually have a difficult time watching a tv movie, the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and i give up and find a good book. this one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end. i realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find denny? they had his name and i would presume his social security number. while he did move around a lot it would seem he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job etc. the actors seemed a bit old for the part and a buried metal object when dug up had no rust. these were only technical glitches and did not take from the file. for a lifetime movie it was better than most.
