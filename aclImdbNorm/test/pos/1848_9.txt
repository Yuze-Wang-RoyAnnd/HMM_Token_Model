i watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (ok - it was the quiet day after thanksgiving) and we both loved it. i love the unique plot, david duchovny, david allen greer, and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door. isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies?<br /><br />i also love the old folks at the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people around southern new england, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. and i love the wedding at the end.<br /><br />minnie driver is great in this movie - and bonnie hunt should have won an award for everything. <br /><br />bonnie - make more movies!
