you know i've seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good. but running out of time was great.<br /><br />i guess what made it so good was the fact that andy lau and ching wang, have such great chemistry. the film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good, we don't want to have a heart attack,lol. in terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested. lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld. also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since "house of flying daggers".<br /><br />the movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner. definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills pact in to one, 8 out of 10
