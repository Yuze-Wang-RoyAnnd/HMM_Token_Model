when i saw this movie for the first time i was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant vibrance of the story. it is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention a very excellent job in the makeup department. jennifer lopez has pulled herself out of past roles that dug into her career with this movie, portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of comatose patients to treat them. vincent d'onofrio played amazingly well. his portrayal of a sadist serial killer was perfect to a t. the sheer emotion conveyed by his performance is astounding. vince vaughn isn't my favorite, but still performed exceptionally well. the symbolism and artistry was intriguing and titillating, sometimes surprising, and other times shocking. overall, i say this is a wonderful movie, with excellent acting and beautiful artwork.
