this movie is on cable sporadically, and i never really watched it, thinking it would be similar to the bruce willis film ""in america", with the usual trite story about american freedom, etc. but it was not; it was so much more!.<br /><br />of course, martin sheen is excellent; (i have never seen him in a movie i haven't loved, even if the script is bad, because he is so talented). kathy bates is the overbearing mom, and does a great job. the real surprise is emilio estevez, who has not always been in the greatest films, but also directed this movie. please don't stereotype him from the "breakfast club" movie; he is so much better in this, and i wish he would do more non-commercial, atypical hollywood movies.<br /><br />the film is realistic, as we see emilio home from vietnam, during thanksgiving. kimberly williams is passable as the sister, who feels she is "disgraced and embarrassed" by the returning soldier, her brother; he is quite alienated from the family, and, especially at this time in us history, this story is very relevant.<br /><br />i learned a great deal about post-traumatic stress, and you will genuinely empathize with this character; this is not a violent, journalistic portrayal, like "platoon" for example, it is more of a character study, which leaves us even more intrigued and concerned about the effects of war, especially when one considers the young age of the soldiers who are victims. with today's violence, it is rare that a movie causes one to genuinely feel sad, and shed a tear; this does it, and deserves recognition.
