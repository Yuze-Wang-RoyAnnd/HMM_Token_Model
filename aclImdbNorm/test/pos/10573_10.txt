this movie was incredible!!!! i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it unfold before me on dvd. it had many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting. the acting by elaine cassidy was in a word brilliant as well as sally hawkins. the storyline is rich with plausible occurrences as well as fresh ideas from the present.<br /><br />there is truly something about ms. cassidy's eyes that leaves "a mark." this movie is a refreshing look on the way in which we look at the 'victorian times' and how we view that society. a very worthwhile watch.
