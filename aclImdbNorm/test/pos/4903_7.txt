although a "woman's story," i found this still fairly interesting. it is unusual in that is has three real-life sisters playing sisters in the movie! i am referring to priscilla, rosemary and lola lane.<br /><br />why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy-rebel john garfield. in their twisted liberal-dominated minds, all-american characters are sickening but sour-on- life, poor-attitude types like garfield played here are people they can identify with. despite that, this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness, which is why i liked it. some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they good hearts. whose heart was bigger than "ann's" (priscilla lane) in here? i agree with the imdb user comments critic in here who says this is priscilla's film as much as the beloved (not by me) garfield's. <br /><br />with a director the caliber of michael curtiz, the film is better than it might have been under someone else. curtiz made sure no scene, soapy or otherwise, went on too long.<br /><br />in addition to the lane sisters and garfield, we have claude rains (who adds much-needed humor to the story), jeffrey lynn (the main love interest of the girls), gale page, dick foran, frank mchugh and mae robson.<br /><br />apparently, this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin-offs from it, neither of them approaching this one in content and box-office success.
