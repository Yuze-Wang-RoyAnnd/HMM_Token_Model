i generally like this movie a lot. the animation is supreme: meaning they took to trouble to animate the hair and fur on animals and people. and being an amateur at graphics and animation (self teaching myself through books. for those who are curious on the same matter, i use the program gmax by discreet. it is a high quality free program that can be downloaded from the internet) i see that the quality of animation shown here is of high standards.<br /><br />the plot of this movie is good. though this movie lacks character development, this story is still understandable. generally, i believe that this movie is primarily should be watched by people who are fans of the game as its plot closely follows the game. as for me, i do not play the games and therefore i don't have the wowing effect it probably does on fans of the game.<br /><br />for those who like the game, i suggest this movie to you, and if you haven't played the game, i would still recommend this movie to you.
