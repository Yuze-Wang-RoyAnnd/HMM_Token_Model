this movie was released originally as a soft "x", apparently with the explicit sex deleted. later, the producers "relented" (smelled money) and re-released it with the excised scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). i guess since kristine was of age, it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt. i guess its all in the timing (witness pam anderson's career)--but ronald reagan was in charge during kristine's debacle (we had not heard about nancy reagan's affairs), bill clinton and monica lewinski were in full swing during pam's "coming out".<br /><br />the sex is just icing on the cake, both version satisfy. this naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at the same time.
