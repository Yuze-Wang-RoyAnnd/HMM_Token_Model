this much anticipated dvd memento of rush's visit to south america in 2002 is possibly the finest rock video ever set down on disc.the picture and sound production values are amazing,even more so as they constantly battled the elements to bring this production off. all the tracks you would expect from the rush catalogue are here from tom sawyer to the pass gloriously reproduced for the frankly,orgiastic brazilian crowd.they actually singalong to yyz-which is an instrumental, and gives you an indication of their fervour!the first disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi angle set-pieces -la villa strangiato,yyz and the awesome drum solo, plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands visit to brazil. all in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.
