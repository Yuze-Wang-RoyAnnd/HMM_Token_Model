barbora bobulova's portrayal of valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. it has been a long time since i have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way barbora does with this character. she was entirely believable as valeria and i was swept away with her characterisation of this role. all at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound. i was compelled to read between the lines and each of the key players utilized the art of body language and emotional intent to convey a strong story line. barbora in particular was visually stimulating in an almost asexual way and at the same time in a sexy way. this comment can relate easily to each of the many emotions brought forward by her performance. understated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence. i have been captured by this actresses delivery and shall eagerly seek out much more of her work.
