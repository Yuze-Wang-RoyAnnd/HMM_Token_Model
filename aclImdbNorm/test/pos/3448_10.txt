this movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts. the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful. the story is also both funny and poignant at times.<br /><br />people who like european films and "art movies" will like this movie. this is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it. go rent it.<br /><br />
