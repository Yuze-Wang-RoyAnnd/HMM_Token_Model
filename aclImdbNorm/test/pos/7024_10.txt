one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's, dirty dancing was a low-budget film with high-budget returns. with a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, to a love story that all of us wish we could live (at least if you're female), this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again.<br /><br />the music, which is what drives the movie, is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer. from classic '60's hits like "love man" by otis redding and "big girls don't cry" by frankie valli to pure '80's hits like eric carmen's "hungry eyes" and frank zappacosta's "overload", dirty dancing is a mix of fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood, all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more.<br /><br />the dancing in "dirty dancing" is not to be forgotten. cynthia rhodes shines in her role as penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts. patrick swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills, not just as an actor, but dancer and singer as well. and jennifer grey shines as baby, while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well.<br /><br />all in all, dirty dancing is one of the best movies of all time, and well worth watching at least once. it's doubtful that the first beats of the ronette's "be my baby" in the opening title won't snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.
