what a movie! it has undeniably entertaining subject matter (unless you're a prude) and a mature, funny, and complex script from paul thomas anderson (magnolia, hard eight). pt anderson will undoubtably be around for some time. the evidence is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece. every character is expertly played and touching and fully-shaped. from burt reynolds as jack horner (the director) to julianne moore (his movie-star) and mark whalberg (as dirk diggler) they all are fabulous. and the story? wow! honest look at business and failure and consequences and family. one of the best movies of all time! i give it a >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>a+
