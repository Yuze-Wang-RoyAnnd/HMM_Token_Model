i shot this movie. i am very proud of the film. it was a great experience which shows up on the screen. halfdan hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. the sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. john york and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story. i feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances. i disagree with some of the other comments that say the acting was not good. watch it and decide for yourself.
