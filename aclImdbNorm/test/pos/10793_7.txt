i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship, and express what they really want to express. eric bogosian's character of barry is like howard stern, but much more intelligent. the character itself is very fascinating. as an oliver stone film, i guess i was expecting more. the film sags a bit during the third act. plus, it's pretty obvious that "talk radio" is based on a play, with its long dialogue scenes. but overall, the film works. bogosian is great in the lead, and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him. if you want to check out one of stone's greater films, i better suggest you check out "jfk" or "salvador." this is not his best work, but a good movie nonetheless.
