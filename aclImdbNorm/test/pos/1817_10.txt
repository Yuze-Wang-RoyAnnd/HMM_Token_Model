i remember seeing this film when i was 13 years old and i fell in love with it and i was a big fan of the film and the characters i adored. my favorite character was stacey (heidi holicker), because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in fred (cameron dye) who really liked her and i was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend, ralphie (christopher murray)because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. i love the cast and the story. i always love the part when fred try to get together with stacey, and i always remember when he chased her around the car. but it was so good. i'll always remember cherish that in my teen years. now that i am 33 years old and i picked up my copy on dvd and will look forward seeing it.
