this is a black and white film from france,<br /><br />simple plot, gangster on the run seeking & getting help etc. we have seen this type film many times over the years. what makes this film different are mainly its acting & style. all the actors perform quietly,no one yells & hardly anyone loses his temper. there are quite a few deaths, some surprising. there are beautiful women as well, but no sex scenes. no car chases either.<br /><br />just talking/ it is so refreshing to listen to people talk, & here we must read subtitles as well.<br /><br />the acting is near perfect by all. especially the lead played by <br /><br />lino ventura & in a smaller but vital role jean paul belmondo. these 2 actors were among the best.<br /><br />i said above the film is flawed, there are a few script deficiencies in few spots, they are minor,the acting is the thing in this movie. production is first rate as well.<br /><br />ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) imdb 8 (out of 10)
