some people may call "cooley high" the same sort of thing as "american graffiti", but i wouldn't. for starters, in "ag", everyone was white, whereas in "ch" they're all black. moreover, this one has a motown soundtrack. specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class african-american students in 1964 chicago and their antics. the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. in their apartments, we see that there's never any dad around. but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.<br /><br />one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. but overall, the main star is the soundtrack. it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). a classic in the real sense of the word.
