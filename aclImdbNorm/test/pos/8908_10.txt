easily one of the best shows ever made, & it just gets better with age.<br /><br />for me , one of the chief reasons for this was the english adaptation done by david weir.<br /><br />a japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in it's original language was more whimsical & less flat-out hilarious that the version we all know.<br /><br />the fact that the show resonates so strongly for its non-japanese fans is , i think, largely because of mr weir's inspired efforts & some winning voice-over work.<br /><br />well done, sir!
