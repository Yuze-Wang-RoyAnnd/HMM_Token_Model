when i reviewed the video for a local magazine, i called it "the greatest achievement in the history of the american cinema." that was not wholly tongue in cheek. tw&tl remains milius' best work, and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore. however, tw&tl remains a striking exposition of what once was known as the american character, largely on the strength of brian keith's superb portrayal of teddy r. (obviously milius--and keith--admired tr tremendously to make two films about him, including "the rough riders.") it's hard to fault this film at any level: a splendid balance of action, levity, relationships, and the serious topic of america coming of age in the world. furthermore, tw&tl has exceptional appeal across the board: note the stats showing it rates best with under-18 males, females 18-29, and over 45! clearly candy bergen struck a responsive chord with women as well as men.
