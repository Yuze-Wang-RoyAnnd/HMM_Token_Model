wow.. i just saw this movie on the sundance channel, and it really is bizarre. i may not be a film expert, but it's probably the most bizarre film i, as an average movie fan, have seen.<br /><br />whoever came up with with it had a great imagination. i'm a bit of a fan of japanese dramas, and there are often actors from dramas in movies.. (matsushima nanako, for example, the lead in ringu, is a major j-drama star.) but it looks like this is the first film for kirie and shuichi's portrayers. i must say, if they really are debuting here, they do a pretty good job.<br /><br />kirie was a very sympathetic character, i thought she was easy to relate with. she was kind and good-hearted, perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attention-seeking girls. she was also pretty in a classic kind of way. i hope she does more films, but it's been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans.<br /><br />the ending was odd. i'm not going to give anything away, but the rest of the movie's bizarreness was kind of put to shame.<br /><br />very bizarre, but very imaginative and unique movie. i'd recommend it for japanese horror fans, though i'll warn you, it's a lot more bizarre than ringu.<br /><br />nonetheless, i'd give it a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, above average acting, and just being plain intriguing.
