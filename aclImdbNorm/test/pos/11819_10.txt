way back in 1996, one of the airliner pilots where i used to work gave me a copy of this film. he told me that it'll make me cry. i never believed him and we even made bets. after seeing the film....i cried a bucket! even after the seeing the film, i found myself in the bathroom crying. it was actually the most touching film i have ever seen. i like the part where dexter's mom confronted eric's mother the line went something like... "your sons' best friend just died today..and it's not gonna be easy...if you ever lay your hands on him again...i will kill you!" the last part where dexter took eric's shoe was a scene that never left my mind until today. honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes teary. a story of what true friendship is all about. my girlfriend loved it too... she hated me for letting her see the film. i cried a bucket, she cried a river.
