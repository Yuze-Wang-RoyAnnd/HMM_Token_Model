i remember watching this film as a kid and i was in complete awe of it, i couldn't take my eyes of the television. this movie has it all for horror fans! this movie had no funny moments expect a couple of one liners by stooge(who was my favorite character in the film) kevin tenney directed this jewel and did a wonderful job with a low budget, i thought the end was awesome the only thing that could stop them was by surviving the night they were unstoppable killing machines! the effects done by steve johnson we're excellent i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for low budget horror movies because as the old saying goes they don't make them like this anymore. the sequels were pretty good too, but not as good as good as the original. this is a must have in any horror collection, buy it if you can find it you won't be disappointed
