i saw this movie five times and never get tired of it. this features traces of the "giallo" genre, but also with a vivid italian countryside setting, where ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer. featuring excellent location (reminiscent sometimes of fellini, sometimes of the taviani brothers), good characterisation and some of the finest genre actors (including the great tomas milian and ida lupino in an unforgettable role), this is not euro-trash, just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation (it recently recieved great acclaim at the paris cinematheque at a double-feature tribute to lucio fulci)
