pat conroy's autobiographical book "the water is wide" proves to be something of a southern "up the down staircase", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, "conrack" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. these students (uneducated black kids on an island off south carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. the one actual actress in the bunch (tina andrews, an amazing performer) plays the "tough nut" conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze. but the story is not ready-made for a happy ending, and i wasn't prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale. it's beautifully done. the script veers off course every now and then, but director martin ritt is very smart to always fall back on jon voight's solid presence. scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker don't add up to much, but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion, and the actual ending is their payoff. **1/2 out of ****
