not too much top's the classic "top gun" or "independence day" when it comes to fighter jet excitement. yes, the movie top to bottom is based on a truly fictional example of how anyone can pull off a rescue but it is cool because it breaks all traditional rules. the kid doing what he wants to do in a jet the way he wants to do it.<br /><br />i can't really put my finger on just what i love about this movie but others i know that saw the movie feel the same way about it i do. i think its just basically a lot of fun but maybe a little too unrealistic for some to buy into.<br /><br />again, regardless, i loved it, people who i know saw it, loved it so its definitely worth seeing to make your own decisions about it. put it this way, i thought that top gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies ever and i like this movie just as much if not more than top gun. don't miss out, do see it, a truly inspirational movie.
