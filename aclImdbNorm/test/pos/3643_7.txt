based on the manga (comic) of well-known artist masamune shirow, this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me.<br /><br />the story is good, but the animation is merely "ok" while it could/should have been mindblowing. the movie is imo adequate, but seems somehow flat & uninspired, if you know what i mean. a wasted opportunity, if you consider that another work by shirow, "ghost in the shell", is considered a classic in many respects. it set new standards for japanese animation, and spawned, among other things, a brilliant series called "gits: stand alone complex".<br /><br />i consider this worth a rental, unless you're a fan of shirow and want it all. do check out the original manga, which comes highly recommended.
