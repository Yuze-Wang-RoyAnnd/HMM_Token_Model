after 10 viewings in 20 years i too think this was the crazy gang's best effort on film, with more cohesion in the plot than their next best, "alf's button afloat". they were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until chesney allen retired in the '40's through "ill-health". he outlived them all by years. apparently they were just as mad outside "work", regularly playing practical jokes on one another.<br /><br />the six wonder boys troupe head for i'll-get-her-to-tell-me (alaska) to dig for the gold that was being found there. it seemed a better idea than going to mansfield ... because they'd been there. when they get to red gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date - they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper they'd read tasted funny. but by then it doesn't matter as they've all fallen in love with snow white and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold. baddie bill "m" mcgrew wants it himself however.<br /><br />the number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing, but most of them will probably only make sense(?) to brits and ex-pats interested in seeing '30's british b&w comedies. imho nearly all of the gags and routines work, including the gold if patter between bud & chesney and the "whistle while you work" pastiche - even the "always getting our man" mountie inserts. a marvellous little film, in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended.
