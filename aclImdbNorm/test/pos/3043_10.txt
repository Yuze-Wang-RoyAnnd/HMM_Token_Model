i saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. i've seen it 4 more times since. i had never heard of it before and i consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. a true, polished, diamond in the rough.<br /><br />this gem of a movie revolves around jon voight (lead character "conrack") as a young schoolteacher assigned to yamacraw island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. at first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home. the heart of the movie is conrack finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. the students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that, only a short time before, had been foreign to them. conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be, oh a little fun! god forbid. learning and fun? together? can't be, or so says the ones in charge. to avoid a spoiler, i shall just say that conrack finds resistance with the boss man....and the ending is truly bittersweet.<br /><br />i am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience, so i should identify with the lead character, pat conroy (aka, conrack, mr. petroy). but i don't, i identify with the black kids. as a kid, i was bussed to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade, circa 1979. these kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then. luckily, in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old, one doesn't understand racism. i just remember we were all being kids, playing 4-square, kickball, hide-and-seek, and running relays.<br /><br />this movie is very moving. there are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end, non-stop. i found myself many times with tears in my eyes, then suddenly laughing out loud. it's a funny movie.<br /><br />"git away from that winda!!".... "sir, if you're prepared to accept crap, i should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap."..... "so, you the white schoolteacher, mr. conrack. my grands love mr. conrack. you a good looking teacher, you a good looking white man."..... "wind 15 mph from the east. small boat warning. small boats beware. big boats ok, don't gotta worry 'bout nothing.".... "not a fry cook, but eleanor roosevelt, not a share-cropper, but (something latin)...that's latin..hey wait!".... "conrack sing like a frog....i sing good, whatcha talkin' 'bout?!".<br /><br />it still mystifies me that i still hear nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following. i intend to seek out more reviews, comments, background, and "making of" tidbits, if they are out there. what amazes me is the acting given from the untrained kids. one of the kids, mary, i understand was an actress, and you can tell. however, the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions. i wonder how they did it! i'm guessing that conrack and mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or ad-libbed.<br /><br />conrack is a special movie. in my opinion, it is one of the very few movies that are so good and so unknown. others in that category are king rat ('65), dark passage ('47 with bogie and bacall), gods must be crazy ('80), and bad day at black rock ('55). i recommend them all. but first, take a seat in the class of mr. conrack.
