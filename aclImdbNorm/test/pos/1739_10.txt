i remember being so excited on saturday nights when i was a kid, waiting for dr. who. i thought it was the best show ever made. then, i grew up, dr. who went off the air, and no one i knew had ever heard of it. then i found out there was going to be a new series. i was a little nervous about it. was it going to live up to the expectations i had carried around since i was little? would they screw it up? would the dr. suck? would his assistant suck? would they create a more intimate relationship with the dr. and his assistant? yes, no, no, no, no!!! this show is wonderful!! i love the new dr. i love his assistant. i love the show. and i find myself excited on friday nights now, waiting for the "new" episode. i'm just now seeing 2005 episodes, as i live in the states, so i'm a little behind the rest of you. i hope the next dr. is as great as this one!
