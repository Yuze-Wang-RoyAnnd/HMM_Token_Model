the warmest, most engaging movie of its genre, those lips, those eyes, made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. hulce and langella are superb and the story seems to write itself. a brilliant screenplay by david shaber (one of my favorites! - see the warriors and nighthawks for more...) and beautiful sets filmed on location (i think) at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place. you can't see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater! please check this video out if you can find it.
