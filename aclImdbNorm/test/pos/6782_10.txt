this game is an action/adventure with combat. there are quite long periods with no combat but other times, you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters. the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life, and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest. the whole game is a quest. you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him. the game is from the mid 1990's and has to be played in dos. i used dosbox and was able to play the game quite well. the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky, but others look batter, but don't let that put you off the game. the game is very imaginative, its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. not for young kids who likely wouldn't be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 might like this game. its a horror\mystery\action\adventure\combat combination.i thought it was a great game. its had to find now. maybe ebay. but remember its a dos game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers. would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use dosbox. oh, and the acting is very good too.
