based on the book "space vampires" by colin wilson. this is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of sci-fi horror to come out of the eighties. the effects (done by ilm) still hold up by todays standards. the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism.<br /><br /> the film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic. tobe hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for it's low takings. but for whatever reason, it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well-paced plot.<br /><br /> not to be over-looked.
