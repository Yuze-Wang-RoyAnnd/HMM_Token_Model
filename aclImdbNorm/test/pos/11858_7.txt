i channel surfed past this many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy, so "love american style". however, it turned out to be quite good, very well done. the two stand-out features are the dialog and acting. great cast. the premise is actually well executed and there aren't too many weak moments. i guess what i was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart, and instead, the cart just banks the turns, so to speak, and the movie keeps flying. there are some nice little sub-plots, particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former conan sidekick andy richter. also, want to mention that the music accompanying it was good.
