i have a completely biased point of view mainly because i live and enjoy the club culture lifestyle. being a dj and frequent club goer i see the honesty within this movie and i love it. if you don't know the club/rave culture then it will be a great foray into that culture for anyone that doesn't know it first hand. the honest portrayal of human emotion and issues in the part of jip i loved. the characters were well constructed and i thoroughly enjoyed this film. i really don't enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this web site. i will write at least 6 or 7 but i feel that i can portray my point with fewer than ten. here are some extra lines to make the imdb gods happy.
