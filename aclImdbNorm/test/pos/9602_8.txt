airplane apart, i don't think i've ever laughed at a film so much in all my life.<br /><br />i love football like mad, but i tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic. this wasn't.<br /><br />i watched it once, it was over 2 years ago & it was brilliant. everyone i know loved it. i remember the gay physio, the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and 'shoes' (a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes). brilliant, that's what goes on in park football.<br /><br />a definite 10/10. if anyone from the tv industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on english tele, please have the sense to show this again (and the muppets while you're at it). also does anyone know if this was shown on bbc or itv. i think it was itv, so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again. they should do.
