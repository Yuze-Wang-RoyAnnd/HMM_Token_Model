two things can happen when an ensemble cast is brought together. either you are left walking out of the theater asking, "why?' or you receive manna from heaven, a delightful comedy from the burton sisters, whose mother not only provided inspiration but the screenplay itself. ursula burton, plays theresa, a nun whose friend's and family had always believed she was touched by g-d. when money falls from the sky the clan use young theresa's faith that the money was gift from the heavens to allow all their dreams to come true. years pass and we find theresa returned home to her native buffalo. she comes to the realization that the gift needs to be repaid and calls together her friends and family, (academy award winners shirley jones, louise fletcher and cloris leachman) to return the debt before easter sunday. the money has long since been spent and all the characters find themselves in financial difficulties. shirley jones and frank gorshin, are a husband and wife con team that teach the all important lesson's in life, of how to dress for winter in buffalo and my personal favorite, "they expect you to take the silverware," when visiting a restaurant. the audience can only hope that if theresa does reach her goal that that someone won't run off with the money. the movie teaches us that it is not money, but ourselves that make our and other's dreams come true. every action has an outcome not just for you, but the community around you. when looking into the mirror we see ourselves as we'd like to be, manna from heaven, answers the question of how other's can see the image we'd most like to reflect. the burtons have done a superb job directing the cast to break out of their shells and create new and inventive characters. in the day of multi-million dollar budgets, this low budget indy proves it is not the cash in hand, but true talent that will draw the biggest laughs. wendie malick (the american president, just shoot me) adds a special flavor to this already talented cast.
