"purgatory flats", shown on cable recently, is a small movie that packs a lot. harris done directs with style. the screen play by mr. done and diane fine makes a good thriller.<br /><br />if you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading.<br /><br />the film is the story about a young l.a. doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it. upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten. bad choice! what thomas reed finds in purgatory flats is hell in the desert. right after landing a job as a bar tender, thomas meets a pretty young woman, sunny, who, clearly is someone to stay away from. the young doctor is called to help as sunny's boyfriend randy, is gunned down by a drug dealer.<br /><br />we get to know randy's family. his uncle dean appears to be ok, but his brother owen is a loose cannon. every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile sunny.<br /><br />the performances are fine. vincent ventresca is thomas, the man who should have gone to his l.a. practice instead of making a detour to the small town. alexandra holden is sunny, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings. kevin alejandro, gregg henry, brian austin play the men in the mecklin family well. nicholas turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer.<br /><br />the film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film.
