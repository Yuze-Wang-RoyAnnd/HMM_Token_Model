while in one country, spain, luis bunuel and salvador dali combined forces to create the benchmark of short-subject, cinematic surrealism, un chien andalou, walt disney and his collaborator ub iwerks in america worked on steamboat willie, the most prominent of the early synchronized sound cartoons (it was revealed that this was not the first, contrary to other reports). it's also one of the more successfully simplistic and funny of the mickey mouse shorts (still in a silent-film way- the only sounds are little irks and bleeps from the mickey and the animals). it also goes by fairly quickly for its less-than-ten minute run. but in these minutes one gets the immediate sense of how much fun disney has with his characters, and how the newfound use of sound changes how his creation uses the animals as musical tools. there's no story to speak of, just random things that happens and occurs because of mickey (err, steamboat willie) on this boat on a river. and like the better mickey mouse shorts, his lack of speaking acts as an advantage. it's a must-see if you haven't seen it as a kid, but if you have it might still be worth another look.
