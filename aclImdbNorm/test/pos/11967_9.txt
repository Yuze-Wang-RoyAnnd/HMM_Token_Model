"east side story" is a documentary of musical comedy in stalinist russia and later in the eastern european satellite comedies, with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors. although some of the stalinist films look laughingly bad (the bright road (?) being a notable exception), the films from the sixties actually look pretty good. "my wife wants to sing," "the white mouse," and "midnight revue" look particularly entertaining. the producers had to contend with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with! since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the iron curtain--there were only something like forty made in forty years--they had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences, who made major hits of some of the films.<br /><br />i notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better. the directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment, and stringent power regulations--they had to film in seven minute takes or less--and dangerous officicrats.<br /><br />i also notice that "west side story" seems to have had a strong influence on "hot summer." the later films may not measure up to "singin' in the rain," but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of "bye bye birdy"
