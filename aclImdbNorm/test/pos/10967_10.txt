john cassavette's decided as his first film, obviously as one shot on a shoestring in new york, to not even have a script with dialog, and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of larry david's curb your enthusiasm- all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk. in other words, it's one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation, jazzed sweetly in it's score and telling a tale of racial tensions. a group of black siblings are the center-point, with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip-club, and has a sister, much more light-skinned than him, who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship, which shatters both sides. the film, however, isn't exclusively about that; cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around new york city (which not many films did in 1959/1960) and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day. dated, to be sure, but worth a glance for film buffs; martin scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences.
