there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon, so i thought "okay, let's watch this." i didn't know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever, i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again. but then story started to unfold, and the characters played beautifully by the two boys. the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a real good movie. very well worth watching.
