the first thing i wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because i'd missed lots with all the laughing i did). i'm european and i've studied abroad and i've as good as lived with spanish, french, italian and german people. the film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews i see that it did p*** people off. but, this film gets the stereotypes so right i cannot fault it. except for maybe the way the french guy became a drunken party animal. the english guy was the perfect "geezer" stereotype. drunk, annoying, insulting but shines through in the end. as well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct. at first he's shy, doesn't know anybody, misses home, doesn't know his way around. as time progresses it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave, it is extremely difficult. a feeling people can only understand if they've experienced it. i highly recommend this film.
