this film is about a young indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman. the problem is that he is gay. in order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control.<br /><br />this film is hilarious and got me laughing many times. sally bankes' acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. the plot is outstanding as well. i find the plot very realistic, and i can completely identify with jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. on the other hand, jimi's boyfriend, jack, is given much less attention in the film. i would have liked him to be given more lines in the film, and have more character development. however, as i guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film, the love between jimi and jack was not developed in the film.<br /><br />it is great to watch a gay affirmative film. furthermore, this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference, be it sexuality, culture and the way of life. this film makes viewers think hard.<br /><br />we need films like this to give us a boost. thanks for making this film!
