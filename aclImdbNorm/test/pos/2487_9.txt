punishment park is a pseudo-documentary made by peter watkins. the premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of punishment park. it's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an american flag, with police, national guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. the idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free. the tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types, all condemning any behavior that is not like their own, and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of "punishment park" for any of those on trial. there are a lot of things in this that still ring true today, which is quite disturbing in itself. the people running the course are promised water at the half-way point, which isn't true, and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice. this is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. the scary thing is, it could happen. not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing. warning: it might make you angry. 9 out of 10.
