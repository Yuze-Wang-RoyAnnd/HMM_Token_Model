i was blown away by this film. i'm one of those people who just takes a risk with movies that don't especially appeal to me sometimes, and i've got to say this one paid off. i mean, wow! even my young boys enjoyed the film (5 and 6 at the time), though i'm quite certain this was not geared to their age groups.<br /><br />this movie was clean, too, which is a great plus. it is so great to sit down to a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity, violence (except one very brief scene) or anything else one is likely to find morally objectionable.<br /><br />this movie brought you along on a journey you are so ready to believe because of the great acting. you feel the vast range of emotions portrayed along with the characters.<br /><br />i never thought a golf movie would have me at the edge of my seat, but i couldn't help being intensely interested in how this one would turn out. i have nothing to compare it to since i have neither watched golf in reality or on film before, but everyone did a great job in keeping the pace and emotions captivating here. the score also did wonders; excellent, excellent score.<br /><br />even if you don't think this would be your kind of film, watch it. you may be pleasantly surprised. i certainly was.
