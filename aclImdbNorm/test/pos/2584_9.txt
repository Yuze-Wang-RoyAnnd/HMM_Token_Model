i watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. it is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. if you don't know what the "black snake moan" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. and no.. it's not just a song. christina ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role, as is samuel l jackson. i think this is his best performance since his role in pulp fiction, and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in bsm. the rest of the cast is solid, with a few shining performances here and there, particularly john cothran jr as reverend r. l.. i'm a very selective movie watcher, and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with its cinematic genius, in my opinion.
