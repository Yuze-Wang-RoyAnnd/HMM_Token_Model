just exactly how director john madden come to settle with nicolas cage and penelope cruz playing the roles of an italian officer and a greek villager in an honourable story: "captain correli's mandolin", just escapes me! witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by cage amid horrendous over-acting, with cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled latino opposite johnny depp in "blow" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a greek nurse... ay, it was painful. but there were saving graces.<br /><br />the story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability. next, a superb performance by john hurt (cruz's father, the village doctor) of oscar callibre, as well as by irene papas, each as village elders, as well as by christian bale (papas' son) among the village freedom fighters, go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by cruz and cage. nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it's teeth-gnashing early on. finally, the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award, and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed. <br /><br />john hurt already has two oscar nominations and this would be a third; i hope he gets it as his performance as the doctor makes this film worth seeing. the true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question, and in this case, it would most certainly not be... not even close.<br /><br />entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar. see it if you haven't. rating = 3.5 stars (of five).
