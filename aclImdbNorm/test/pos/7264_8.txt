if you liked lock, stock and two smoking barrels, the chances are you'll like this, too. although i guess a few of the british in-jokes (like calling two london characters dixon and winterburn, after arsenal soccer players) may be lost on some, this is still cracking entertainment, which veritably pumps with vitality.<br /><br />carlyle, miller and tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interplay between the two protagonists is always well-judged. in fact scott's direction is very assured, considering that this is his first feature film, and proves that he has his father's talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundings.<br /><br />hell, i've convinced myself. i'm gonna see it again!
