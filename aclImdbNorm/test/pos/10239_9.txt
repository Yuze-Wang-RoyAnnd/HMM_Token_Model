i was peeved that the best make-up academy award went to dick tracy, a horrible film with horrible make-up. the nightbreed (based on the better titled "cabal" novella) look terrific, the acting is excellent and david chroneburg makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonist.<br /><br />the plot focus's on aaron boone, who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery. is he making it up or are they real and calling to him? his pyschologist (chroneburg) convinces him he's a murderer, a slayer of families.<br /><br />troubled and suicidal, boone seeks refuge in midian but the monsters don't want him at first. he is also tracked by his girlfriend, lori who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous.<br /><br />but decker isn't about to let boone continue on. he raises the locals on an all out assault on midian, like a holy war in gods name led by the devil.<br /><br />barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male, but they are always strong and honest. nightbreed turns the genre on it's head. the monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but man is hunting them.<br /><br />a 20+ minute longer cut was originally submitted by barker, but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece. barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release. until then, this version will have to do.
