it is a damn good movie,with some surprising twists,a good cast and a great script. only a couple of stupid bits,like the rasta hit-man scene (this guy's a professional?) but that has been commented on already. the fact i had only heard one guy at work mention it before, and did not have many opinions or reviews to go on, made it even more entertaining. this gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves, but i have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast. it sickens me that some movies get made whose budget equals the gdp of a small country,with a hyped up release,good reviews,an oscar winning director and/or actors, and turn out to be so disappointing,with actors sleepwalking through their roles and uninspired directing,with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big,sandra bullock could drive a bomb-loaded bus through it. (examples in my opinion are the terminal,castaway,matrix:revolutions) extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the cast,especially paulina porizcova,who wears a rubber dress in one scene,and a jacket with "c*nt" on the back in large letters in another!a sex scene which shows off her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses! and please,enough with the tarantino comparisons,this did not remind me of a tarantino flick at all.... and tarantino borrows virtually every idea he has ever had from other movies! even if that is your opinion,are we saying once a certain film or book is written or directed one way,no-one can ever use the same ideas again? get real. this film has it's own style.
