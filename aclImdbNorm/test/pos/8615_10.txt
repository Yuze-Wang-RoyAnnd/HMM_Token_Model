i wasn't surprised to read a comment by the director to the effect that she made this film as an antidote to all those "making of" dvd featurettes, as that certainly struck me. i do confess that i have a penchant for "meta," but i found this film to be very accessible and entertaining, and not even in a labored, self-consciously clever way, which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a film about film-making. it is very "french" in that there are a great deal of outlandish, yet occasionally compelling theories about how film-making (and even sexuality) "works," but since the director doesn't quite play herself (using an avatar instead), we're left with a lot of choices (since i'm pretty sure she's constantly contradicting herself). apparently catherine breillat specializes in hard-to-watch films, but i'd definitely say this one doesn't qualify. i really enjoyed the dialog, the balance between the cinematic and the natural, the relationships between the director character and her assistant and actor, and so on. highly recommended.
