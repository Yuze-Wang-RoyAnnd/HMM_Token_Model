i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! i enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. this is what the scifi lovers want. excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver ! ok the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films.. films like mission impossible and braveheart are great but these aren't sci fi films.. sci fi produces excellent films like sabretooth , alien hunters etc .. well done .. keep them churning out!
