when a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(richard johnson of "zombi 2" fame),a mad scientist(joseph cotten),his beautiful daughter(barbara bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.the tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.and though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "mysterious island" and "humanoids from the deep".there is plenty of gore with really cool decapitation scene and throat tearing to boost.the acting is so-so,but the film is fast-paced and entertaining.give it a look.8 out of 10.
