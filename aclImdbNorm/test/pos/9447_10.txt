she's the man was the funniest movie i have ever seen. i laughed so hard that i was crying. it was also very romantic. channing tatum is absolutely gorgeous and can really act. it sure doesn't hurt that he has quite a few shirtless scenes either. channing and amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. i love this movie. when you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene. it was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. i highly recommend this movie. amanda has never been funnier. and channing is going to be a huge star. this is just the first of many for this bright new star.
