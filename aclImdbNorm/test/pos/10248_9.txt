you want a movie that'll take you places? well this is a good pick. if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film--the hayday of motown--or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about, i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. at the risk of sounding cliche, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll reminisce and remember. you'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. you'll recall with fondness your best friends from school. it's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism--misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. i think everyone regardless of race, age, socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it. so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film; there are much worse ways you could spend your time.
