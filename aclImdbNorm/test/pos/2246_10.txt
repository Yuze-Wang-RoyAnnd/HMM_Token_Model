the slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. there was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start for all that. as is now common with this doctor the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage. they were always there in the classic series, but they were a side issue, to be glossed over when the doctor was in the heat of battle. this regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle! this episode finally shows mickey embracing the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous episodes. his journey from zero to hero is complete, and it has been an utterly convincing one. with scares, humour and scenes that brought a lump to your throat this episode had everything. after much consideration i can finally say that the new series betters the classic series in every single respect. coming from a die hard whovian you can get no better recommendation than that.
