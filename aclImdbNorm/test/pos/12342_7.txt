this is an ok early 80's horror flick in which a young girl (meg tilly) is wanting to shed her "goody two shoes" image and becomes part of a girl gang called the sisters. their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum. too bad the mausoleum is the "final" resting place of some psycho russian psychic and he's not quite dead yet. seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck into the walls from his telekinetic target practice, plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet. all proof that hitch hiking can be dangerous, so listen up girls. the daughter of this man (reymar) is rather distraught about her father's death and is confronted by a man that said he knew reymar and given a tape to listen too. her hubby (adam west, of batman fame) is there to laugh and scoff, and not much else. but it seems that perhaps reymar's daughter may also have some abilities that she doesn't realize. anyway, having deposited their unfortunate pledge at the mausoleum, the rest of the sisters take off to go get stuff (like masks, sheets, etc) to come back and scare the crap out of her, but little do they suspect what's going on and they get more than the crap scared out of them. for even in death reymar is kind of a busy guy and he's reanimating lots of corpses for entertainment. and it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait. overall this is acceptable horror, nothing too intense but not terrible either. the dvd from media blasters also contains another version of the movie that's a rough cut, i guess, i only watched a little of it so i don't know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what i saw i guess it's a "warts and all" presentation. 7 out of 10.
