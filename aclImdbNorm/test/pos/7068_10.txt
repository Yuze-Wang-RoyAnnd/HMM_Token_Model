some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one for eating, one for breathing and the other one for s**ting... this is not a movie for them... <br /><br />but for those who enjoy using the brain... the whole movie is a metaphor, everything is there for a purpose, every single detail, the coffee mug, the red couch, everything... is a underestimated masterpiece... <br /><br />it is hilarious, is raw and totally realistic, that's how we actually interact.... it is a royal comedy... total causality...<br /><br />just hang on, don't let the first scene shock you..... hang on... and enjoy the show....
