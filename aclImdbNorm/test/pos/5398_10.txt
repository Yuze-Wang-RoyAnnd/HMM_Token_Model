imaginary heroes is one fine little film! written and directed by dan harris this story is classic theater, weaving comedy and tragedy together so tightly that the climax of the film takes your breath away.<br /><br />the travis family is an odd bunch: no member is who each appears to be. beginning with a suicide of the reluctant 'hero' child swimming champion matt (kip pardue), the father ben (jeff daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while the mother sandy (sigourney weaver) turns to pot and rage and sarcasm, the daughter penny (michelle williams) returns from school repulsed by her family's behavior, and the remaining son tim (emile hirsch) takes the brunt of all of the above by avoiding his classmates, girlfriend, and teams with his neighbor kyle (ryan donowho) to leap into drugs and sexual experimentation. throughout the film tim tries to hide bruises on his body that have a secret all their own yet lead his girlfriend to feel rejection, his mother to rage against the trailer park trash bully she believes is the cause, and finally open the window to the deep scars this family has suffered for years. secrets and lies, here, and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic.<br /><br />this may be sigourney weaver's finest role, although emile hirsh, jeff daniels, ryan donowho, and kip pardue (despite the brevity of his role) all contribute top-notch performances. the story begins slowly and seems to meander and that fact may lose some viewers' attention, but stay with this little powerhouse film and the impact of the work will stun you. highly recommended. grady harp
