as far as i am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs i am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is paris, france; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.<br /><br />both make this movie a bit unique, at least to english-speaking film noir fans. actually, an american, jules dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a european film. initially, i was disappointed in this after i had watched the first 40 minutes. it's an expensive dvd and i was bored. however, once that silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know what's it about), the film picked up considerably and just got better and better.<br /><br />in fact, i thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. the best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. this is what makes the disc worth owning. it's excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen paris...and this is paris in the mid 1950s. there are lots of bleak-but-interesting rain-soaked paris streets and buildings i found fascinating to view. in fact, there were many more of those great shots than of london in the much better known film, the third man.<br /><br />the lead actor in here, jean servais, i think his name is, also is interesting to view. someone described his face as a cross between humphrey bogart and harry dean stanton, and that sums it up perfectly. a warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. this is france, not the united states, so there is a little bit of both in here. i appreciate the dvd offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version, too.
