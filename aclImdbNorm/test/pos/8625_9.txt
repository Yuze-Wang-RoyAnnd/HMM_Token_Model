about 12 minutes into the song, in the scene where daryl hannah and jfk jr are first embracing, there is a really pretty song playing...what is that song?! and, who is it sung by? it's a song that sounds very romantic and it is a female singer, piano playing, etc. i have tried everything in the world to look up the music on google and on itunes, etc., but it just doesn't come up, not even on lyrics websites. so, if you hear it i would sure love to know enough about it so that i can try to either go get the cd with that song on it, or find it in itunes. i don't know if my email will pulblish, i am new at this...but i will be looking back here.
