i'm from phoenix city and the first time i saw this movie and read the book it only confirmed the stories i had heard all of my life. i asked my grandfather about the mob and he told me that when he got back from fighting in the pacific theatre he started up a cpa firm that is know the largest in the columbus area. when he was just starting out he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them, but he said that he gently declined. even when the fbi and army came through phoenix city and cleaned it up my grandfather wouldn't take it lightly when my mom, aunt, or uncle went across the river, but i assure you all of that is over now. the downtown area of phoenix city is in need of restoration and it has slums by the courthouse where all of the shooting still occasionally takes place over angry, uneducated, low socio-economic people, and the 14th street phoenix-eagle bridge has been shut down for a solid 15 years and replaced by a newer 13th street bridge, but on the more fair side of phoenix city on summerville rd. it is very quaint and the scenery depressing.<br /><br />another incident was told to me by my best friend's family from high school that lives in a nothing spot on hwy 165 called holy trinity, alabama, which is about 28 minutes outside of columbus, ga. my best friend in high school's uncle was a man that went by the name of old man davis. regardless of how the movie goes, that fact is that there were 3 bosses and old man davis was one of them...you can even read about him in the original book. legend has it that he was so cold-blooded that he went to downtown phoenix city to make a deal with a man, but apparently the man backed out on the deal right in front of old man davis, so the old man davis proceeded to take a sawed off shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of town by the courthouse. they say he even walked off nonchalantly because the mob had paid off every law enforcement official in town so he had nothing to worry about.<br /><br />another incident is about a bridge that another one of my friends owns a rental house next to in downtown phoenix city. it is the same bridge that the mob killed and threw a black man off of, and you can even read that part in the book. i also would like to as that in many columbus and phoenix city civilians were asked to be extras in the movie. when the patterson's friend is murdered and brought to trial and proved guilty in front of the judge but still set free, well, the judge is my fathers partner in his law firm in columbus, who unfortunatlly is deceased.
