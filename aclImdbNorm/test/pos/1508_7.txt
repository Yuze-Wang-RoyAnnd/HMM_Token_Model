the one who says that lucio fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splatter is probably mad.the italian director is a legend among hardcore-horror fans,and his work exceeds the barriers of the genre(who can forgot his western,crime or fantasy flicks).this is probably his goriest film,and unfortunately one the last.a horror director(fulci as himself) starts hallucinating about gruesome murders.he goes to a psychiatrist,who makes him believe he is the criminal.in this time,the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes.with such a plot,the movie should have been filled with something.and there are roting corpses,crashed or melted heads,stabbings,decapitations,chainsaw dismemberment and many others.kind of boring sometimes,the film is saved by the excessive violence that will definitely please the gore addicts.
