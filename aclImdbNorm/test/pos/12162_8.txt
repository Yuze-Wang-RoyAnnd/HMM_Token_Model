the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang. they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. in the main the group's six men were bud flanagan, chesney allen, jimmy nervo, teddy knox, charlie naughton and jimmy gold. hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family. the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late!<br /><br />i often cringe when i see the statement "it's very british" because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it. the reason it bothers me is because in this www/internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing, will hay and the imperious terry-thomas. so, then, is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience? well yes it's true, so much here is topically british, but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history, and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal. with the anarchic "not" so wild west make over an absolute winner. a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience. not all the comedy works, and in truth the "big 6" are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott. but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts. you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an ovaltine gag, but if you be a classic comedy film fan? i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here.<br /><br />now then, dose the mounties always get their man? 8/10
