this is a must for all but especially african americans. it is about time there is a movie that expresses and shows the concerns going on in african american relationships. it also allows other cultures to see in a fictional humorous manner how positive african american relationships are and the outcomes of them instead of the undesirable stereotype that plagues the african american community. i love this film a must see!!
