i rented "the china syndrome" recently mainly because i read that it was this film that inspired abc to make "the day after". "syndrome", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. the film is quite political, but i agree strongly with its message - nuclear power, though extremely efficient, is far too dangerous for common use. the risks are simply too high. hopefully, the persons in charge of real nuclear plants are far more responsible and ethical than those depicted in the film. however, given that the real-life near-disaster at three mile island happened mere months after this film was released puts that in question. (in fairness, that case was probably more one of incompetence than of corruption.)<br /><br />"syndrome" is not just critical of nuclear power, but also of modern news media, similar in vein to "network", only much more serious. being a print journalist myself, i am quite familiar with how people perceive the media; but it was a little frightening to see that even in the '70's tv news was already selling out. when jane fonda's character tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of fluff, she is advised not to try the change, as "research" finds that people prefer a pretty girl to do fluff, not hard news.<br /><br />what truly makes the film memorable, however, is the incredible suspense generated in its final third. during this period, the viewer is constantly fearing for the lives of the protagonists, whether the danger is coming from hired thugs or the potential meltdown of the nuclear plant. and that very last scene - i won't give it away, of course - but it will keep you guessing.<br /><br />on a final note, i did get a distinct feel watching the film that it seemed at times more like a tv movie than a true theatrical film. this could be, however, due more to the fact that the rental tape i was watching was quite old, and not formatted to fit tv screens the way videos and dvds are today.
