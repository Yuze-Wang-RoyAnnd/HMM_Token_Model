once again, doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load. it has humour ("you're just making it up as you go along!" "yup, but i do it brilliantly"), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. in short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). the way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of "get on with it". so, chalk up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh, then made you cry, and made you go "eek".<br /><br />in terms of character development, this is clearly the clincher for noel clarke's mickey (and ricky). being one of the doctor's companions, you know that he will do the right thing, and may even suspect the manner that he does it. however, it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path.<br /><br />while "the rise of the cybermen" had more of the sinister build up to terror, "the age of steel" is an all out blast. like "alien" compared to "aliens" - both true classics, but in different ways. can the series keep it up at this level? let's hope so.
