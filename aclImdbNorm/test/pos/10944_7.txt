well don't expect anything deep an meaningful. most of the fight scenes are pretty decent. the two leading ladies are quite endearing but their lack of hk action background shows at times. the ending maybe lacks something but i quite enjoyed it none the less. the cheesy humour isn't probably going to appeal to anyone who hasn't watched a bunch of hk films but if your down with that sort of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something meaningless you could do a lot worse than this. (ok so you could do better but.......)<br /><br />certainly on a par with most of the hollywood blockbuster action drivel.<br /><br />7/10
