i think this is pauly shore's best stuff, he played the part perfect. i really enjoyed this movie, patrick renna is really funny as zack the annoying little brother. son in law is a good comedy worth your time, but the only thing i wish tiffany thiessen was the farm chick instead of the one they had.
