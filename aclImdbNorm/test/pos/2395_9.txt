eddie monroe is hooooot. he is a great actor and i could be his girl anytime. he's so fine. i was so sad at the end. i'm not going to ruin the end but wow. girls are so vicious. his girl was wrong. if eddie was my man i would never disrespect. those mobsters were spooky. the moral of the story is trust no one. your friends will hurt u if they can. oh and eddie tell your girlfriend that yo mine, she should move ova! i would suggest seeing the movie. why? becasur i said so. it kept my eyes on the screen. my sister loved it also so i am going to see it again because now my friends want to see it and its worth seeing two times. peace,happy new year!
