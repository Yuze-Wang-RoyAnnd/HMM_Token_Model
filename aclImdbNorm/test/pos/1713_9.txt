i enjoyed some of the older doctor who many years ago, so when the new one came out, i just had to check it out. i was so pleased - with the characters, the story lines, the updated look, i became hooked! from season 1 (27 for the old fans) through to season 2 (28), it just keeps on getting better. it ties in nicely with the old shows too, although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version.<br /><br />even though there has been a change of cast, i highly recommend doctor who - with chris eccleston and with david tennant.<br /><br />i like that they've given the characters so much depth. the doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, maybe because he is the last timelord. the range of emotions which chris and david show are truly remarkable, and i felt their pain, anger, and sense of adventure right along with them. <br /><br />billie piper (rose) brings a very human element to each episode, although she is much braver than i would be. with her talent, billie will go far in the industry.
