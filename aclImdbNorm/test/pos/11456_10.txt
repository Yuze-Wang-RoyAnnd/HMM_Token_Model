i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie. not just because i'm a huge linnea quigley-jill terashita fan, but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times.<br /><br />the special effects are awesome, especially linnea's scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed.<br /><br />plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill, plenty of humor, cool soundtrack, high body count, etc...by the way, if you have never seen this one, try and buy/watch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing.
