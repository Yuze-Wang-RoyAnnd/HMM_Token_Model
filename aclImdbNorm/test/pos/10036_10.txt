now this is more like it!one of the best movies i have ever seen!despite it made very well on all aspects,this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate.loosen up!there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand,how entertaining and how captivating this movie was!now this is what a movie ticket is all about!you will get exacty what you want from this movie's genre and all naysayers are those with the anti-flynn syndrome.this conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti-elvis,anti-ali,anti-clinton,anti-kennedy syndromes,usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs.if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art,you will find this movie not only one of the best classics,but also one of the best movies of all time.i rate it the second best western ever, right behind wayne's the cowboys........
