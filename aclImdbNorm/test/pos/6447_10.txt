i was wandering through my local library, browsing vhs tapes, when i saw a movie that made my mouth drop--waterbabies. i have been hoping to see this movie again--it's been over 22 years since i saw it (cable-movie channel around 78-79). i had recalled a good many of the details--grimes in particular. my son, who is 4, and i watched it.<br /><br />he agreed with me that grimes was "not nice", and the best way for me to describe it was that he didn't love tom. he accepted that. it was amazing that i still recalled some of the songs, too! they had stuck in my head for 22 years--which means they had to have some memorable-ness, eh?<br /><br />it's a good child's movie, with parental guidance in case of questions about what children had to go through that were not nobility/society in the time-frame. this is what all the children faced daily (except for a few lucky ones), and while we try to disney-coat movies, making them more pc for children these days, it doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist--or even still doesn't. i enjoyed the animation. it wasn't disney, no. i don't think don bluth touched a paintbrush on this movie.<br /><br />there's a lot going for it, though. david t plays two roles! (i really like him!) james m does too. the waterbabies themselves are cute. you feel sorry for tom, and root for him. then billie herself is extraordinary in the multi-role part she's playing--it's as if her eyes are magickal! i'm a huge fan of woo, tlw&tw, and company (and looking forward to hp!), and i filed this along with those kind of movies. yes, he jumps in the water, but not because of suicide. he jumped because he trusted the lady in black--she'd been appearing to him all along.<br /><br />i think it's a good movie! if you have kids, pick up a rental copy. if you happen to locate a buy-able copy, let me know where! ian liked it! :)<br /><br />dee
