ok so paris hilton sucks in it (typical malibu barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! i watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. chad michael murray is sooooooooooooooooooo hottttttttttttttttttttt and he's just a ace actor. total hero man. the main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. thumbs up. i think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax! i totally got creepers out by the wax models in the house although they looked so real. i still haven't got the story with the twins at the moment, i am just waiting to get the dvd then watch it all over again. thumbs up to such a great film! 11/10. all those people who don't like it, please don't bother 2 criticise my opinion as mostly everyone thinks its cool to do so. also i think the paris scene when she strips to her underwear is totally inconvenient. why not just get a dog shagging some cat.. be more entertaining then that. when paris death scene came up, i thought it was poor as she still kept running although a knife just went up her foot. hmm.. interesting. <br /><br />!chad all the way!
