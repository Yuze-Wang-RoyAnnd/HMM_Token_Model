shuai is a burly and uncouth young beijinger with a punkish haircut, who ekes out a living selling cheap books from a stall in an indoor market. he wouldn't appear to have anything in common with the wiry, middle-aged, would-be intellectual, zhang - and yet the two of them wind up in a restaurant together discussing the pro's and con's of murder (the chinese title would perhaps be better translated as 'talk it over'). if that makes it sound kind of pedestrian, don't be misled: this film is profusely inventive in its plot, and mostly races along at breakneck speed (although the pace does flag quite badly towards the end).<br /><br />if you only know zhang yimou's worthy historical dramas like raise the red lantern and shanghai triad, or his more recent martial arts epics, hero and house of flying daggers, you'll be amazed; in fact, whichever of his other films you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is far and away his most original, most quirky, most experimental work. it was shot within a couple of weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely on location in beijing (and making use of many ordinary beijingers in the smaller supporting roles - there's even a fleeting cameo by the director himself), and mostly with a hand-held camera, in a jerky, hyper-kinetic style which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his best-known films.<br /><br />ok, i live in beijing, so i find an additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that i am coming to recognise and relish (even though it was shot in '97, and things are changing so rapidly here), but i really think this film can be appreciated by anyone. i saw it, as i have so many other chinese 'comedies', at a movie club that screens sub-titled versions of recent chinese films for an almost exclusively expat audience; and it is the only one i can recall where the audience was laughing out loud. some non-chinese audiences might find it a little too strange, a little uncomfortable at times, in that it does include some violence, and, after opening as a breezy, offbeat romantic comedy, mutates into something much darker in its second half. it is, however, very, very funny.<br /><br />it's also superbly acted by the two leads, especially long-time zhang yimou collaborator jiang wen, who is probably mainland china's foremost film star, and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young depardieu or de niro.<br /><br />watch this film - for proof that the chinese have a sense of humour that can translate to other cultures, for proof that zhang yimou is far, far more than a one-trick pony...... and for a thoroughly good time.
