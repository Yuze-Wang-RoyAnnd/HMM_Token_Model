having recently purchased universal's marlene dietrich dvd collection, i was somewhat reluctant to watch "golden earrings." the idea of a 40-something marlene dietrich as a gypsy in a war-time romance seemed unusual, and implausible. i should not have worried. with all the professional talent that went into these old movies, it's hard to miss, really. the movie was a joy to watch; it's a classic.<br /><br />the most interesting thing about the film was dietrich, who pulls off the gypsy role perfectly. the makeup, lighting, photography, and her performance all add up to make a really startling and memorable character. i had never seen dietrich play a "good" woman convincingly before--but she does here! she played a lot of heartless vamps in those great sternberg films, so it is refreshing to see her in a more down to earth, relaxed role, playing an exotic but very human character.<br /><br />overall, a very nice romance. the love story is believable, optimistic, and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
