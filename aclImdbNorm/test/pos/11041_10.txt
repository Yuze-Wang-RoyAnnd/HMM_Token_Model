viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent. however, the german film version which had english captions was her greatest performance. greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound. greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films. this story was very sad because greta garbo(anna christie),"ninotchka",'39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain. there were many scenes of old nyc, the brooklyn bridge, coney island and the sky line of manhattan. charles bickford(matt burke),"days of wine & roses",'62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.
