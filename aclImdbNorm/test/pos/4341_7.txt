lol.<br /><br />the mere fact that i start off my review with 'lol' says it all. i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then i sensed the silliness of it all. the low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. i watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. it's so bad it's actually good lol. like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. there's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so. the soundtrack is so funny, i laugh every time i hear it. the 'climax' is just a laugh riot. it's an all out war zone in new york, full of explosions and total chaos...so ridiculous you can't help but chuckle at the sight of it. <br /><br />other hilarious moments: <br /><br />- the scene with kersey and the cop running side by side like 2 cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funny.<br /><br />-it killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking ever-so-careful (and slow) aim and not get hit lmao. of course, with him it was one shot-one kill with his elephant handgun lol.<br /><br />- another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang....with a rocket launcher lol...destroying the whole side of the apartment building with it.<br /><br />- it's apparent that kersey is all but used to losing loved ones...when his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates. the acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone that could only think that kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lol....he runs down, looks at the carnage and just walks away.<br /><br />again, so bad, it's good.<br /><br />*** out of **** stars.
