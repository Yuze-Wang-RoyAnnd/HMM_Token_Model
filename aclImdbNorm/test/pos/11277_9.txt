i absolutely like this film a lot. it is not very entertaining, but it's a feast of bizarre and stunning images! there's no dialog ,only some background sounds and noises. if you are into something completely different and original, and enjoy the obscure and bizarre...then you might like this work of art. ik looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made ,in a time where strange human-like beings live and perform their bizarre habits. god has killed himself with a razor and gave birth to mother earth. mother earth impregnated herself with god's semen after an act of fellatio, and gives birth to a son "flesh on bone". what follows are inhuman acts of ritualistic torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know....or do we?
