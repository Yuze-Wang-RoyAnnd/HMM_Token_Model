george sanders playing the saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script - with the usual good rko cast around. it's a non-charteris story too, bristling with murders and good clean fun.<br /><br />thread 1: in new york, police inspector fernack, templar's friend is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced - st comes over from london to try to put things right. nice and simple so far - but is there really more than $90,000 in the world? thread 2: another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother, wendy barrie does well in bumping off some nasty men and having the saint fall in love with her to boot. including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in fernack's cellar - there's a creepy shot of him (dead and staring) and them in a car when they're taking him back to where they'd got him. paul guilfoyle as pearly gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this - witness the dressing gown at the beginning, and the later beguiling comment by st that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet - and did too for "palm springs"! fernack was played by jonathan hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from templar to liven him up.<br /><br />the hays office also made sure you got the picture right, all threads are tied up with no straggly bits. well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing, but if val kilmer's version is your yardstick then don't bother.
