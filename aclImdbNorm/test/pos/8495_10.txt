this movie has inspired me to be a better person. in life you don't know who you will run across and sometimes our prejudice will cause us to prejudge a person wrongly. i have learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie. i also learned that tough love can build a stronger person. now i want to know where to find the movie soundtrack. there are songs in this soundtrack i have been trying to get for years. may i comment on the acting for a second. jamie fox was outstanding. the man has risen to be the actor of actors. also the performance of regina king was awesome. if i can get a woman to look at me the way she looked at ray...i can only dream. i plucked down $18.00 for this movie and i don't have a lot of money but i am willing to see this movie again and again. this movie touched me.
