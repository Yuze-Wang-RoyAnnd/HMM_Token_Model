check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in. we get a pretty good look at super-secret los alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end wwii. except for the tight security, it looks unthreatening enough. note how it's a tv repairman, an obvious regular guy, who takes us through security. once through, it's like any-town-usa, nice homes, quiet streets, kids going to school, and a family tv on the blink. later on we see little tommy and little peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates. the movie appears to be saying, "okay, we're tough, only because we have to be. but, basically, we're still just folks."<br /><br />now, i expect that was a comforting message to cold war audiences still not used to government's "dooms-day" research. it's a clear effort at popular reassurance. the one darker note is when tommy's mother (clarke) worries about her son's mental state. he doesn't say, "when i grow up"; instead, it's, "if i grow up". that note of doubt not only reflects a los alamos reality, but also a national one that in 1952 had just seen footage of the apocalyptic h-bomb. note too, how professionally fbi agents are portrayed, a standard feature of mccarthy era fare. when brute force is needed, it's not they, but private citizen gene barry who thrashes out the information
