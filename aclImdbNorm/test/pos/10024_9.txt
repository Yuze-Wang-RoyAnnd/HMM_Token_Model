while i can't say whether or not larry hama ever saw any of the old cartoons, i would think that writing said cartoons, file cards, and some of the comics would count for something.<br /><br />for fans of the old cartoon, this is pretty much a continuation of the same, except with a few new characters - and a more insane cobra commander.<br /><br />we still have all the old favorites too, but on a personal note, one thing that always irritated me was this "duke in charge" stuff, when there are tons of other *officers* around instead.<br /><br />the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well; the main trick here seems to be the cgi. it's overall pretty good, if not a little over-the-top.
