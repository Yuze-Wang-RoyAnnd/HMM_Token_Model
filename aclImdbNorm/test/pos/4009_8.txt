most of the criticism of "attack of show" is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old computer tv program called "the screen savers." people are upset because g4 decided to cancel the "screen savers" and replace it with the pop culture based "attack of the show." to compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges!<br /><br />"attack of the show" is a unique hour long program that covers current generation x/y culture. it features segments on movies/television, panel discussions, video games, new dvd releases, sex advice, new gadgets (mp3 players, cell phones, etc), comic books/graphic novels, magazines, and internet fads. <br /><br />it's a fun show, definitely worth checking out you are in your 20s or 30s. i give it an 8 out of 10.
