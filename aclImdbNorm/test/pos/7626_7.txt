i was 9 when i first saw this on tv. on a friday night. i remember the full page ad in the tv guide with the picture of the rex. amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years. anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with boone and keats raging at each other. special effects are no harryhausen but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late night tv. haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable tv. if you do catch it on late night don't be too critical just grab some snacks and enjoy it. it might be cheesy but i thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in the theaters a year before.
