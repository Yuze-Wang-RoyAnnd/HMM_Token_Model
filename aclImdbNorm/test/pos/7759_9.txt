good animation, nice character design, and a light-hearted story make suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />after my first viewing, i thought that this anime was pretty good, but but was much better on for a second watch.<br /><br />this is because it is done out of chronological order, and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn't see before. (or it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn't notice before) you may want to read the original novels (not manga) by tanigawa nagaru before/after seeing this. the anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows.<br /><br />however, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated, but are referenced to.(bamboo w/ wishes attached shown in episode 14) overall, this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot (reading the book improves upon it as well). it is a nice break from the shounen-jump anime that seem to be taking over.
