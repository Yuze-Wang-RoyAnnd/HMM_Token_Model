i am sligthly biased because i appear in this film but i loved it and i am only in about seven dispersed minutes and am not nearly the most interesting part of it. the film is an honest and intriguing account of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovable movie. it is also an account of bloated expectations and fallen heros the interviews are well patched together in the editing. the different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of one person. also, the interviews are shot in a pretty interesting fashion keeping the film visually satisfying. definitely a worthwhile film. i hope it gets around.
