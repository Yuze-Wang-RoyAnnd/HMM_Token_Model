i watched this film with my family over a long thanksgiving holiday weekend. i am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it, though i didn't pay much attention until the end of the film when a head shearing seems promised, but, alas, doesn't happen.<br /><br />on the other hand, i watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, sparkle, and just plain fun. i think that the film has a female tone. women are not exploited in it even though i am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation. i think the movie plays with tropes of the period.<br /><br />i keep thinking someone ought to remake it. and flesh out some of the implications in the original.
