amazing, one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom. guess i can take some pride in not liking what "the general populace" tends to go for. jackie mason is hilarious in this movie, and so's randy quaid. i can never get enough of his "strong-arm" tactics, just like in moving. he was also notable in national lampoon's christmas vacation. love that guy.
