it's not often that a tv series grabs me right off the bat; a recent chance download of the pilot for surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode, after which i immediately set out on a fevered search to learn everything i could about this wonderful series. to my chagrin, i found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. such a shame.<br /><br />since then, i've acquired the remaining episodes, and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best television i've ever watched. just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, i loved how they ended every episode with a huge finish. i imagine watching it each week i would've been screaming with tension and just captivated, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. growing up, i always heard that was how early serial movies used to do it, ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episode.<br /><br />well, it seems for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this off, and apparently the people behind the show must've seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things definitely take a turn for the worse. i wouldn't say the episodes actually become boring but a lot of the plot elements become a bit more clich'ed, and i've got to say, the final episode really left me feeling cheated. i just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance. the *only* other show that left me feeling like that was the first season of stargate sg-1, which just resonated tremendously, feeling very "true", soulful and made from the heart. surface was a great series, and maybe one day, some well-heeled tv lover will see all the outpouring of emotion about the show's cancellation, and bring back this show. one can hope, at least. :)
