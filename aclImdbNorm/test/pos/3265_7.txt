it's hard to know what to make of this weird little aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. that being said, two hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring. the absurdity of the goings-on, the thick australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help to ensure that the film entertains also. the plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he'll go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local kingpin. he doesn't; the job only lands him in trouble when he fancies a swim and stupidly leaves ten grand on the beach, which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree. however, all is not rosy for our hero; who must find the money or face the consequences...<br /><br />the film is made up of a cast of unknowns; at least, it was back in 1999, as nowadays heath ledger is something of a name. he doesn't impress too much here, however, as his performance is mostly of the one-note variety and he doesn't make for a very compelling lead. he fits the movie in that he's australian and looks naive; but beyond that, he's not the best lead i've ever seen in a movie. if you ask me, bryan brown gave the best performance here. he might not have a great deal of screen time, but he steals every scene he's in and it's him that provides the movie with a lot of its humour. he's got nothing to do with the best sequence, however, which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever caught on film. on the whole, i can recommend this film to people that enjoy quirky crime films; as the weirdness is plentiful, and the way that events take a turn for the bizarre is enjoyable; but if you're not a fan of this sort of film, i can't really say that two hands will float your boat. it's not a must see, but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it...you probably wont completely regret it.
