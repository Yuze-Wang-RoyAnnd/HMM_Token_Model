...and i'm so disappointed because i can't seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere.<br /><br />its a kind of mix of, uncle buck and the great outdoors and molly ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. this was made when molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink.<br /><br />i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge! <br /><br />if anyone has a copy of this, or knows where i can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.
