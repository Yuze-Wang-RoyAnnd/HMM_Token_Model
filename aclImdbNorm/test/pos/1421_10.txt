warning: may contain some minor spoilers.<br /><br />hard to say anything bad about this movie, except for one thing.<br /><br />you don't get to see it much anymore !!!! then again, maybe that's because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it the fox movie channel.<br /><br />too bad, for this is another gem lost to time, clifton webb takes his patented sour, know-it-all demeanor he had perfected as lynn belvedere ("sitting pretty" and sequels), and turns 'nature boy'.<br /><br />actually, it's like this.<br /><br />webb plays robert jordan the host of a sunday children's educational program that is losing audience share, and the network breaks it to him that he needs to do something about it, or else.<br /><br />part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children.<br /><br />bummer !!! but as such things happen, the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of boy scouts, and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'volunteer' ... in the host, so jordan he takes the position.<br /><br />problem solved, right ???<br /><br />wrong !!! this being a movie there are other problems.<br /><br />for example, it turns out one of the scouts is the son of his boss at the tv station, which causes a little friction; especially since the kid is overweight, has asthma as well as an attitude.<br /><br />and he is the more reasonable one.<br /><br />also, there is this cub scout, mike (george winslow) who wants to hang around, being the 'stray puppy' type.<br /><br />as it turns out, the reason is that he has no folks of his own, but is cared for by a relative who hasn't much time for him.<br /><br />it is things like this that makes his job harder than expected. <br /><br />all in all, webb becomes more understanding of kids, and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson, and eventually even adopts mike.<br /><br />still a great movie after all these years.
