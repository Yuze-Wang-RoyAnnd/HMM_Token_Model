the love letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally i was skeptical when i heard it was to become a movie. but, i liked it. i found myself grinning through the entire movie. i admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. i thought that capshaw and scott were perfect as helen and johnny. just as i pictured them. and the town and scenery were just right as well. i recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.
