this film is a very beautiful and slow film. there is nothing hollywood about it. it is very danish and the characters are very real. it is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme. it is really about love that has no gender. i would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and charlotte) are attracted to each other. it is a story about love and life.<br /><br />the story pretty much takes place in the two apartments. there is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense. the two actors playing the main characters are great. they really make them seem real. they are not archetypes, but real people you could meet in the street. i think it is the first time i have seen a transsexual portrayed this well. very well done.
