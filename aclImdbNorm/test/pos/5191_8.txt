the magnitude of the stalingrad tragedy is concisely presented in the end note of the movie: "in the battle of stalingrad, more than one million people were killed in action, froze to death or died of starvation: russians, romanians, italians, hungarians, germans, austrians. of the 260,000 surrounded men of the sixth army, 91,00o were taken prisoners, of whom only 6,000 returned to their homeland, years later.<br /><br />what the story does not tell was that fieldmarshall paulus, who surrendered, did not share all the hardship of the captivity of his men. he had a special treatment as the highest ranking prisonner taken by the soviet army. when, during his presence at the nuremberg trials he was asked about the fate of the 91,000 prisoners, he declared that they were fine. he was freed after the war and died in the east germany.<br /><br />the film only presents the first part of the tragedy, the actual battle of stalingrad. however, for an entire picture, the fate of the 91,000 prisonners should also not be forgotten.
