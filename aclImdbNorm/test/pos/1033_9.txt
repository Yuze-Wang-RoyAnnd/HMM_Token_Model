i, too, found "oppenheimer" to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on american pbs. david suchet was particularly effective as edward teller, as i recall, and the overall conception was spectacularly good. the only reason that the series doesn't rate a full 10/10 is for the low-budget production values in some areas. actual content is absolutely first-rate in my recollection.<br /><br />the oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the uk on july 31st! it will be a region 2/pal set, but it would seem that a region 1/ntsc set should be soon in the offing.<br /><br />if you have a universal player in the us, you can order the series right now from amazon uk.<br /><br />http://tinyurl.com/znyyq<br /><br />huzzah!!
