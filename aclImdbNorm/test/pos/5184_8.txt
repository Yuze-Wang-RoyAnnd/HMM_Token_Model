the three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: ernesto, hopelessly devoted to mercedes. this was part of the frustration: screaming at mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no-good harry, to no avail.<br /><br />then there's the satisfaction: steve buscemi has a great part as a transvestite, and harvey keitel's moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap tv movie is incredible. when you least expect it, quentin tarintino is doing half a monologue, and anthony quinn turns ernesto into a wealthy man.<br /><br />time and again great moments appear in the story, but in the end it's hard to know what to feel about this movie. it doesn't have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but it somehow feels right.<br /><br />this movie is strange, but then so am i; no wonder i liked it.
