at the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who barbara stanwick was parodying.today only some women over 50 probably remember gladys taber,whose column "butternut wisdom" ran in family circle magazine from before world war ii until the 1970's.she lived on stillmeadow farm in conecticut,and her columns were collected into a number of books,stillmeadow seasons, stillmeadow daybook, etc. the lines that barbara stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical gladys taber column.besides cooking and country living,she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times.she talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels.you might say that martha stewart is the gladys tabor of today.<br /><br />christmas is connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece,but it is pleasant,lighthearted entertainment,soothing to the stressed out mind,and that is good enough
