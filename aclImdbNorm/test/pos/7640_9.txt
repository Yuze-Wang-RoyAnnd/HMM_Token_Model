i don't see why all the people are giving this film negative reviews?!?! i loved this movie! bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't appreciate art, i can see why you would not like this film. it was a great twist from the average, played out vampire movie. if you are looking for a fresh, new and ingenious new vampire movie, then this is for you. but if you want one of those turn into bats, wolves and melt in the sunlight movies, then go watch your old played out dracula flicks. sure, it is a bit on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. i'm very happy that i found this movie, because i was about to give up on the vampire genre fro good. i thought this film was brilliant! i give 2 thumbs up to the writer, director and everyone involved in the film.
