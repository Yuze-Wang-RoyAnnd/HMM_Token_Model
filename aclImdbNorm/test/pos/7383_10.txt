this is one of my all time favorite movies, it's great to watch in groups, i find. it's also great for any alan rickman fan, he does such a wonderful job. it's engrossing, entertaining, very surprising... you have to watch it twice, at least. i haven't watched it with anyone who didn't like it or at least find it worthwhile.
