it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better "bargain bin" movies out there - i'd feel a bit cheated if i had paid lb15 for it, but at about lb1.50 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth. <br /><br />the film can't quite decide if it wants to be "mad max" or one of the clint eastwood "man with no name" spaghetti westerns, and as such is stacked with clich'es from both. even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in "mad max" is there.<br /><br />that guy from "blade runner" also cops a good billing, although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie.<br /><br />favourite bit - for me the punch-up on top of the oil refinery - if you look closely you can see the "post-apocalyptic" rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other.<br /><br />get several lagers in, a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel.
