i get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. on the other hand, hi de hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. i have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and i am surprised at just how much i am enjoying it all - again. i have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait. the gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves. croft and perry created some pure gold some of which shines through hi de hi.
