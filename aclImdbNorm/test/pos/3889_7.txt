any movie that offers bonnie hunt, sarah silverman and amy sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching, and comic actor jeff garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut, a sad-sack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. familiar as larry david's manager jeff on "curb your enthusiasm", garlin plays james, a still-struggling, 39-year old chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother. his self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving. if the storyline sounds a bit familiar, that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 ernest borgnine classic, "marty", about a lonely bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother. in fact, garlin uses "marty" as the play which james is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the character's situation.<br /><br />naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version, and silverman plays beth, an off-kilter, sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree. their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles. hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with james for jazz musician ben webster. they meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of first-graders, including his best friend luca's pert daughter penelope (played by dakota fanning's look-alike baby sister elle). in a wedged-in cameo and looking quite a bit like jerri blank, sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to james after his inappropriate monologue. david pasquesi plays luca, a retirement home manager, and his scenes with garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe. almost stealing the movie is character actress mina kolb, who plays james' pixilated mother with pluck and heart.<br /><br />there are also unexpected cameos from teen idol aaron carter and gina gershon (don't ask
