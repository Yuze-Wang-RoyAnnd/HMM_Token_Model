not sure i've ever seen a black comedy from denamark before but this is quite good actually. the humor is suitably low-key and deadpan to go with some of the gruesome activity. svend and bjarne are fed up with working for their boss, because he's always putting them down (in fact he mentions that they weren't bright enough to unzip before peeing at one point). they do what they have to to start their own butcher shop and when a workman is accidentally locked in the cooler overnight while fixing a light, they hit upon something that makes their butcher shop far more popular than their old boss's. in fact, he's the one they sold their first "filets" to, and it's partly his fault, since he served them at a rotary dinner at his house and the guests raved about it and showed up at svend and bjarnes the next day. bjarne is somewhat horrified what svend has done but it doesn't stop there. svend has risen above his sad little existence to be someone of some popularity which is new for him and he doesn't want to let go of that, so the freezer continues to fill up with all manner of acquaintances (and, at one point, "a small swede from the park"). suspiccions arise, though, because ex-boss holger thinks something is wrong. bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother eigil, who lived in a sanitarium for years in a coma and whom bjarne wanted the plug pulled on so he could get inheritance money to help open the shop. when eigil was taken off the respirator he was revived, much to bjarne's horror. and bjarne has a love interest too in astrid, who works at the cemetery. neither svend nor bjarne are well adjusted individuals and so things start to spiral out of control. the deadpan humor really makes this, and while this isn't exactly laugh out loud material it certainly is amusing. it is somewhat creepy though considering the cuts of meat and body parts casually lying around, especially since these two take it all so matter-of-fact. if you're a fan of black comedies this is recommended, i liked it quite well myself. 8 out of 10.
