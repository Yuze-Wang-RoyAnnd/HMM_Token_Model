most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. fox, which paid judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. well, i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. basically, judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex, which produces more stupid people. by 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks "all faggy." seriously, is this really that hard to believe. oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like "can we family style her" and "hey man, i'm 'bating here!" this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.
