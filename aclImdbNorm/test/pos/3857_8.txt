i must say one big reason why i thought the aristocats was so great is because i love cats!!!!i love cats,which probably gave this film a big score from me,but not only that,it was definitely a good movie as well,and i love where they make the setting of the film take place.this is one of my favorite animal films,although it's animated,and i really love how the actors\actresses didn't sound so unprofessional behind the animals' voice's.to me this film seems like a classic,but i guess to imdb it's not,because it has,yes i think too low of a rating.you take a peek at all the other "original" disney films and they have a much higher rating than this,but nonetheless aristocats is one of the best animation movies there is and i could enjoy it over and over again!!
