once again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into english humor, not too often seen on screen since the days of monty python and man about the house. too bad.<br /><br />brenda blethyn (who i first saw in saving grace early in the year, another must see by the way.) just excels, as alfred molina does. the rest of the cast, while virtually unknown to me, turns on great performances too. the film starts slowly and gradually gains in pace and amusement - midway i had tears in my eyes from laughing.<br /><br />all in all, a funny english movie, a thousand times better than the supposedly 'funny' garbage that comes from hollywood.<br /><br />
