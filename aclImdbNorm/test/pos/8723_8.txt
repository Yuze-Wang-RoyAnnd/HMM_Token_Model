as much as i like walter matthau, i felt that the majority of his roles were tailored towards his personality. this role is one of the exceptions. he plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. this role does require much more acting than in most of his other roles. i liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid commitment in a relationship. his whole aim was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be committed in any way. the alibi - using his secretary (ingrid bergman) to pretend to be his wife. at some point in the movie, the pretend mr. and mrs. actually are deluded into believing that they were actually really married. the ending was good, because a middle aged man found that pursuing someone in his own age group was more worthwhile. the movie was funny, entertaining, and didn't sell out by being preachy.
