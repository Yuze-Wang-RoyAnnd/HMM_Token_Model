this mystery/psychological-thriller is i think one of the best i've ever seen. all the actors give a wonderful performance, especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star. you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself. the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating. also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard. you won't forget this movie!
