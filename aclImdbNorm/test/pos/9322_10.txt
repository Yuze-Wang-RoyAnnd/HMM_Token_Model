this excellent musical movie, in beautiful technicolor, is so wonderful it's enough to make every person of irish descent feel proud. full of the joy and celebration of all things irish, a fine cast, with brilliant settings and superb theatrical trappings, lovely irish music and the superlative irish tenor voice of star dennis morgan, 'tis the luck o' the irish to have such a marvelous movie to enjoy over and over again! not just just for st. patty's day, mind you, but for all year round.<br /><br />one of the jewels produced by jack l. warner during his heyday as studio boss in burbank in the 1940s.<br /><br />shame on warner brothers for not having this fine picture available on home video and dvd!
