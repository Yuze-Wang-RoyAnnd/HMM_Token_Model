do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you've seen. one of 4 films scott made at rko during his prime (1947) the others are always easy to get. liberal, kansas is just southwest of dodge city and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorns into trail street, the town's main street, and the sod-busters who feed our bellies. it'll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order. more i won't say, except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three. randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor, courage, level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing. fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they'd learn positive values. robert ryan co-stars in this film, playing a good guy for a change. in real life, ryan was one of the many world war ii heros who starred in america's movies. how sad what we get these days. george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers, while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in munich and the palestinian terrorists who killed them. hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left. i wonder how all this plays out in liberal, kansas. liberal, after all, was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.
