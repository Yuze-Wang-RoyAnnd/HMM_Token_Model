i was very impressed with this film from newcomer dir./writer jose reyes. the cast was excellent. "jorge cordoba" executed a powerful<br /><br />and shocking performance as the lead character of "rafa". it's inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent. <br /><br />it takes talent, courage, and determination to go out and make a quality film.<br /><br />i admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile. <br /><br />it's easy for people to judge young filmmakers more harshly, but i applaud "jose reyes" <br /><br />and the talented cast for their successful efforts.
