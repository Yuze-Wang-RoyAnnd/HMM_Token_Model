near-wonderful mixture of comedy, romance, and medical chaos has a 50-ish swinging-single doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads, dating a patient his own age whom he met on his rounds. screenplay by julius epstein shows a fair amount of sophistication, though he doesn't have enough material to fill out the picture's last third, and one can almost feel the movie slipping. the subplot about the hospital being investigated for its shoddy business affairs isn't worked out satisfactorily, and it feels highly concocted anyway. still, walter matthau and glenda jackson are a terrific team, richard benjamin and art carney very funny in support. director howard zieff keeps it all popping, and even when epstein's one-liners feel like neil simon rejects, zieff zips right along happily. the results are dryly engaging and occasionally quite sweet. followed by a failed tv series. *** from ****
