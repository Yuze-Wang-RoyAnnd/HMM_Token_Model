after repeatedly saying how brilliant so many columbo episodes are, it's time to honour an episode with maximum points. "etude in black" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! <br /><br />last week i reviewed "just married" and compared it unfavourably to "meet the parents". well here's one of the parents, blythe danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor alex benedict, played by the legend that is john cassavetes. alex has been having an affair with jennifer wells, a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair, one suspects). she is blackmailing alex to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra, alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.<br /><br />enter columbo and guess what? it takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. it doesn't take much longer for columbo to connect alex to the victim, and soon he's following him around wherever he goes. even though columbo is certain alex is his man, it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads (none of which columbo really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />along the way there are some top-notch extra characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbour of jennifer wells and the english mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on coronation street, through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder (he had also been seeing jennifer wells, the busy girl!). and there's even a brief cameo from commandant lassard from the police academy films. as with leslie nielsen in "lady in waiting", it's impossible to take him seriously (i bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <br /><br />but it's blythe danner, john cassavetes and peter falk who steal the show here. blythe is absolutely divine as mrs benedict. from the moment she spots alex dialling jennifer wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. it's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />as for john cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as columbo villains, because he could have been up there with jack cassidy and patrick mcgoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. but this performance is superb! he's another one who falls into the "highly irritated" category, losing all patience with columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge columbo's genius.<br /><br />well it's a really, really fantastic show. it loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. and at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of john cassavetes and peter falk on the dick cavett show from the early 70s. i'm totally convinced steve coogan watched this clip and based alan partridge on it. everything about the clip resembles knowing me knowing you, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of cavett by his guests. even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while falk, cassavetes and their friend ben gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />it might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between peter falk and john cassavetes. it's clear to see from the quality of "etude in black" just how well the pair worked together!
