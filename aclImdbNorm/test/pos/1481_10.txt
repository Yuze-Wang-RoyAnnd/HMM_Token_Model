i liked this movie way too much. my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside. of corse ironside is just a low rent jack nicholson. i guess mike was busy that year with "highlander 2: the quickening". sadly "beastmaster 2" would have been a much better career move. it is certainly the best of the beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic "masters of the universe". not only does it star the incomparable mark singer it also features an amazing supporting cast, specifically the second girl from "sliders", uncle phil from "fresh prince of belair" and evil chick from "superman 2". it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets. beastmaster forever!!! rock'n roll!!!
