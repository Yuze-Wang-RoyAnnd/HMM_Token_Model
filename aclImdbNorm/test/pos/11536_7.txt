jennifer egan's novel was brought to the screen by canadian director adam brooks in a film that, based on some comments from contributors to this forum, sounds a bad proposition, but in fact, it's much better than one is led to believe.<br /><br />this is a story about two sisters who loved one another dearly. faith, the fair headed and happy-go-lucky hippie girl, takes her younger sibling, phoebe, under her wing. phoebe plainly loves faith; when the older one decides to follow her boyfriend wolf to europe on a summer vacation from berkley, she promises she will send phoebe a post card every day. faith does that, until the cards stop coming in and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them faith has died under tragic circumstances.<br /><br />phoebe can't forget faith. that is why after some years pass by, she decides to take the same route the older sister took. she takes the cards from faith and visits each place, starting in amsterdam, then moving on to paris and she wants to end up the trip in portugal, where faith encountered her untimely death.<br /><br />in paris, phoebe hooks up with wolf, who by now, is not a hippie anymore and is living with his girlfriend. wolf, tries to persuade phoebe into abandoning her trip and to go back home; she suspects that wolf holds the key into solving the mystery, and as she is going to depart for portugal she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts wolf's version he has told phoebe. he feels guilty and, against his girlfriend's wishes, decides to accompany phoebe to the town where faith died. the story changes at this point and we go back in flashbacks to what faith experienced in europe and what happened in her final days.<br /><br />the best thing in "the invisible circus" are the performances of the principals, something that mr. brooks has to take the credit for. the big surprise is the range of cameron diaz, who, as faith, seems to select light comedy parts, when she is quite able to do good dramatic work under the right director. jordana brewster is seen as the older phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. she is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a naturalness for acting. christopher eccleston is wolf and shows he also is capable of doing more serious drama. the sweet camilla belle plays the younger phoebe quite convincingly. blythe danner appears as the mother of the girls.<br /><br />the european locations are gloriously photographed by henry braham. the film is also enhanced by the musical score of nick laird-clowes and petra haden's original song. elizabeth kling edited with great elegance. ultimately, this film shows adam brooks in great form as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and gets rewarded by having the right cast doing wonders for him.
