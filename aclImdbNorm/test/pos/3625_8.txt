if you've never experienced the thing that is zasu pitts, here is a zasu zinger! in 1933 mae questel caricatured pitt's voice for the character olive oyl for the fleischer studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip popeye. zasu (pronounced zay-sue) does her best "olive oyl" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. i kept waiting for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead it's "something always happens to somebody." the first time i saw this film i loved zasu and found her character really funny. i've since seen her in other films where she does this same whining, uptight, fragile-flower routine. so, upon watching this film again i started getting a little annoyed with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust. but, there are some funny comedy bits here, and it's also a mystery movie as well. it's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. the mystery plot holds together well through the camp of zasu pitts and james gleason who plays arthur crimmer the policeman. the haunted house is fun with many a secret passage and even a skeleton in the attic! well worth the watch. read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
