i was lucky enough to watch this film in the recently concluded international film festival here. i was actually able to watch another south korean film (the power of kangwon province) but christmas in august caught my attention more. the story is simple enough, the usual boy-meets-girl (or shall we say girl-meets-boy?). what made it special for me was how it was rendered. we can say that the movie was quiet and endearing. we don't have flashy and contrived romance here, only two ordinary beings made wonderful by their friendship and unexpressed love for one another. i also loved how the movie used pictures as expressions of relationships past and present. i wished that this was shown here as a regular film. i'm sure it would call out to a bigger audience.
