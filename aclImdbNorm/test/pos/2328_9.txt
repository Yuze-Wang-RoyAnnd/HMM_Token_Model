not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. kelsey grammar is wonderful in this movie. another funny guy is rob schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with ken hudson campbell who plays buckman. lauren holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as lt. lake. bruce dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. the actor i liked the most was toby huss as nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious.<br /><br />plot is a little uneven, about lt. commander tom dodge, who for years has wanted to command his own sub. when he finally gets the chance, instead of a brand new sub, he gets a rusty wwii diesel sub, the stingray. his crew isn't any better, misfits of the u.s. navy. he is then put in a series of war games, that shows how an old diesel engine can handle itself against the current nuclear navy. things still don't get any better when he finds out his dive officer is actually a female officer, to see how women do on actual subs. to get the commander position he wants, he has to win the war games, and blow up a dummy ship.<br /><br />the movie fairs quite well, in fact i laughed non-stop when i saw this movie in theaters. i loved when they were in silence and buckman farts, and everyones reaction to the smell is hilarious.<br /><br />overall, 9 out of 10, this movie is just plain fun to watch, it nice to have a movie like this, i hate movies that try to be 100% serious.
