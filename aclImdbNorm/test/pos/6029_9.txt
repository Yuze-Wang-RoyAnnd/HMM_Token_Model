this movie is a little slow in the the beginning, for about the first 10 minutes or so. but once it kicks in you can't turn it off. adam beach and rose mcgowan play the best parts and are great at their acting job. you would never be able to guess who the killer is. i gave this movie a 9, because at some parts adam beach needs to speak up a little so you can hear what he's saying.<br /><br />9/10
