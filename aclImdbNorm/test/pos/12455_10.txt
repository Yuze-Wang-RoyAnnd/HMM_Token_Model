watch it with an open mind, it is very different, nothing's cutesy about this. very well done realistic tale of tarzan. the animatronics chimpazees are well done for '84, christopher lambert was brilliant imitating chimpazee language and behavior. i wouldn't be surprised if he took lessons from jane goodall.
