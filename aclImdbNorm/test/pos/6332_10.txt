i've been watching buffy the vampire slayer and really didn't begin to love the show until season 4 started. this episode "hush" was view by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through furiously by an after storm. the writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring the heck out of me. i was in awe the entire episode which i just finished 2 minutes ago. amazing doesn't touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue. if you've never given this show much thought at least watch this episode. if this doesn't impress you then no episode probably will.<br /><br />btw my heart is still racing...
