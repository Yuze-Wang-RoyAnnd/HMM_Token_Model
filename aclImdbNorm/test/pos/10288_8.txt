all credit to writer/director gilles mimouni who fashioned this winding, twisting tale of deceit and betrayal. while keeping the utmost control, he maintains the audience at arm's length, never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on. even his clever denouement has you guessing.<br /><br />the three central performances are also top class, with vincent cassel, romane bohringer and monica bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery. jean-phillippe ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role. to give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair.<br /><br />thierry arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma, and cardine biggerstaff's editing keeps the story a step ahead of us. the theme from peter chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script.<br /><br />many may say gilles mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love. for me this is simply a haunting, elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web. only the french are capable of such tantalisation. hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending.<br /><br />monday, march 2, 1998 - hoyts croydon<br /><br />no-one does thriller quite like the french. when they get it right, they really get it right.<br /><br />vincent cassell is intriguing as the deceptive max, romane bohringer obsessive as the new lisa, and monica bellucci is mysterious as the first lisa. the plot from gilles mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires.<br /><br />all credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot, and the performances from the three leads. as lucien, jean-phillippe ecoffey is strong and emotional.<br /><br />friday, january 15, 1999 - video
