this movie travels farther on 8 gunshots, 2 kisses and 100 clich'es than should be possible. yet it still works. brilliant.<br /><br />as i was driving home from the theater, i tried to figure out how it got away with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience standing up and screaming, "i've seen that a million times before! and you've pushed beyond the edge of believability!" but the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that i forgot to care. a friend who saw it with me said it transported him to paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in indiana.<br /><br />overall, a romantic-comedy-thriller with subtlety, wit and elan.
