i wish i could have met ida lupino. when people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner, well, for me one person would be her. i think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities in the film industry. her life story would make a great tele movie (hey, mr bogdanovich........). ida lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. i can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly aip film is the late 70s. she was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. ugh. i should have contacted her then as she died not long after.. more from the part than the worm too. from high sierra, roadhouse and the extraordinary rko thriller on dangerous ground, ida lupino was often the producer and the lead actress. later, with her husband howard duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today. one of them is jennifer which i think is the last film with a monogram pictures copyright. monogram changed the company name formally to allied artists in 1953 and jennifer has both company names on the opening credits. this is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both the innocents and the haunting made 8 years later. really chilling and very creepy, this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film ida lupino made and was responsible for. try and find it...you will always remember it and as i feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress/producer.
