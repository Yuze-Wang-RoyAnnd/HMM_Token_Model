this is actually a brilliant movie. the story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. especially the performance of mads mikkelsen as svend, is magnificent. it's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own, but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story, with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken steaks. if only more people understood danish... this could be a great candidate for an english version. it is also worth mentioning ole thestrup, who always delivers that extra twist to the plot, with his slightly mad character holger. i can only recommend this movie to the danish audience. also take a look at adams aebler (2005), a movie by anders thomas jensen, also with mads mikkelsen accompanied by a well playing ulrich thomsen.
