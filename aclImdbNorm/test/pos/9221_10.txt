i adored this, but i am an 80's kid. i loved rainbow bright my whole childhood. i don't know if little ones these days would be very interested in the show, mine wasn't. (but thats okay, i bought it for me anyway. i just brought the little one so the guy at the checkout stand wouldn't look at me funny.)i love the non violent drama, and the colorful scenery. it just reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) although i may be just a little biased on the subject. afterall i was rainbow bright 6 years in a row for halloween........i wonder if they make a rainbow bright costume for adults. lol.
