i recently bought this movie on dvd at a discount store for $5. although it is a no-frills dvd on the geneon label (just the movie that starts playing immediately - no menu, no special features) the picture and sound quality were excellent. the movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history.<br /><br />richard jordan, who i must admit to not having heard of, plays the lead - pinky green. a charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so! he portrays an american in england. david niven plays the lead bad guy, also with the great charm for which he is famous. bad, but with scruples as when he refuses to deny pinky his "whack" for the job. whack, in england, apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in american gangster films! all the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable movie.<br /><br />what is perhaps best, to me, is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable (i frequently find myself lost in plot confusions and various characters) without any special effects. no blood. no violence. not even a single car chase! just a well written story, well acted, well directed and well photographed! if i had any complaints about the movie, i would question the music. what is bluegrass music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in england?
