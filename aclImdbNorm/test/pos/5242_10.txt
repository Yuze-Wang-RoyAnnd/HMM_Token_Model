i have really nothing to add to all the other comments, save this: to me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound. the text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression i suppose. along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted, theatre-like acting; marguerite churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film, but at the end is allowed finer expressions. gus, the swede?, reminded me of the comic characters of shakespeare plays, and windy sounded to me like an early donald duck.<br /><br />it truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors, on location, and even though the dust of all the wagons, horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers! it also was clear to me that many of those indians must have been real, and i didn't detect any overt racism towards them. and john wayne looks so incredibly young! as someone who became a real wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by john ford, and thought that stage coach was wayne's first as a leading star, this film was a revelation. the plot is very simple, again reminding me of a silent film, but the grit is very real indeed! an amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930.
