i can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than quentin tarantino's. (at least in his films) inglourious basterds is no different. we all know tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as reservoir dogs and pulp fiction. since, he has been a disappointment for some. well, i am relieved to say, tarantino has not lost his touch. he brings us his best since pulp fiction and thankfully so.<br /><br />we know the story, a wwii tale told only as tarantino can. (fictional of course) a war film hasn't been done like this before. brad pitt as lt. aldo raine leads the basterds in nazi occupied france. their goal - killin' nazi's. christoph waltz as colonel hans landa plays a similar role on the other side. he's know as the "jew hunter" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. the third sub story consists of a young jewish refugee, shosanna dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. and she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the germans for her devastating lose. there actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. if you know anything about tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.<br /><br />war has never been been so fun. the basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. the dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other tarantino films. the entertainment and hilarity is led by brad pitt. i found him extremely funny and entertaining. i couldn't wait to see him on screen again. even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. also making great impressions were m'elanie laurent and christoph waltz, who were tremendous. the film was filled with noteworthy performances.<br /><br />the story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? it isn't meant to be a documentary. tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. the cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. you've really got to love the last line in the film... but pulp fiction remains his masterpiece.<br /><br />quentin tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. wwii, is one of the most tragic events in history, but tarantino some how manages to make it fun. inglourious basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. it's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of quentin tarantino.
