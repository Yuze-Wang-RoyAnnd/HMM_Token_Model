i like the film, it's the best pirate-movie i watched hitherto (forget silly errol-flynn-stuff and pirates of the caribbean). this movie is wonderful melancholic. i compare it with "johnny guitar" at the sea-side (but 3 years earlier), two women fighting for a man, where mad love might lead one.<br /><br />the character of the female (anti-) heroine, anne providence, is superb, acting without compromise like a child, lost alone on her search for a own female identity in a real man's world. she's a quite strange movie-hero, not a funny pirate, as most of her companions in this genre, not making jokes all the time, fighting for the poor and good and only killing the stupid spanish or british soldiers or - better - sly governors, but she's murdering all the poor prisoners of war, after she captured a ship (look careful at this at the start of the movie), she's primitive (she can't even read), she is desperated and she get's an alcoholic, she looses all her friends as consequence of her obstinacy and she's wearing rags most of the film. this film shows a pirate "hero" a little (!) bit as he (or in this case "she", but there has been a female "anne" buccaneer, anne boney) might have been in brutal reality.<br /><br />the film is quite short and the story is told in a breathtaking manner. certainly, a film from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for present time viewers (the ships swim very obvious in a bath tube), but this real drama about love (that kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice drives one crazy. maybe, anne is even supposed to be judas iskarioth and jesus from nazareth in one person, being betrayed by her friend (the french larochelle) as jesus; after being disappointed by the friend, delivering him to a death penalty (as judas); than getting remorse about this (like judas, who commits suicide according to the gospel of matthew); and in the end sacrificing herself for the rescue of the beloved enemy (as jesus). but, even if you are not interested in this philosophical questions of guilt and atonement, the film brings a lot of (cheap) action as sword fights and burning (plastic) ships for a very short one and a half hour.
