every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. so, listen again and note the difference. the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received, polite, well- enunciated english. i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in leicester, unknowingly, asked me, age 14, to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border. i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference.
