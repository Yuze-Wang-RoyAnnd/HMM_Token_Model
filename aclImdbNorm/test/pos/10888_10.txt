you wear only the best italian suits from armani, hand stitched and fitted to your exact measurements. your automobile is the finest that german engineering has to offer, and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. you're a member of the finest polo clubs, frequently dine at restaurants such as spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber gun. you snow ski in the alps, go deep sea diving in the caribbean, sky dive over the andes, and all the while your hair is never, ever, out of place. you are bond, james bond, the world's most renown spy, favorite son of the good queen, bad boy of the british ss, and perhaps the most desired man in the world. the character of james bond was created by ian fleming, and is the movie industry's longest lasting icon, being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades. the latest man to play the role is pierce brosnan, who took over the role of james bond from timothy dalton in 1996, and made his 007 debut in goldeneye.<br /><br />this is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the nintendo 64. goldeneye, developed by rare for nintendo, has been on the market for some time. its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it.<br /><br />let's face it -- most of the time movie-licensed games are flops. although the two seem like a good mix, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. games like cliffhanger, true lies, lethal weapon, and not to mention all the star trek flops, are ammunition enough against this mix. and for the record i am not a fan of movie licensed games, especially if i've seen the movie. at least that's how i used to think. in the case of goldeneye, i had more reservations than normal. while not a bad movie, goldeneye the film didn't have that much appeal to it, and i don't rank it in the top ten amongst bond movies. as a game, however, let's just say it's a completely different story.<br /><br />the game is a first-person shooter, and in order to be successful, you'll need at least as much brains as brawn. for those who have seen the movie, which i imagine is most of you reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation. a plot to control the world's most dangerous satellite, goldeneye, has begun in the ussr, and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured. your missions will be many, the danger extreme. you will have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known. m will brief you as soon as you're ready. good day, james.
