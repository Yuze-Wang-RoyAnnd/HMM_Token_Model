brian (wesley eure) works for a security firm owned by mr. norton (conrad bain). the norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (jim bacchus). it's not brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. but, mr. norton has no patience with brian, in part because norton's beautiful daughter, casey (valerie bertinelli) has a thing for brian and norton questions brian's motives for wooing her. however, brian does come up with a great security device. it's called chomps, which stands for canine home security system. the device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. the rival owner sends two bungling spies (one is red buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. will chomps save norton security? this is a fun family flick from the old school of good, clean entertainment. chomps is, of course, a real dog, played by the adorable and talented benji. in fact, benji has a duel role, as brian has a "real" dog named rascal, too. just watching this little dog in action is pure joy, as he is able to scale walls, "pull" trucks, and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys. the human cast is also quite nice, with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious. costumes, scenery, and production values are good, too. although you may have trouble locating the film, it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. chomps is a wonderful, wholesome diversion from the world's woes.
