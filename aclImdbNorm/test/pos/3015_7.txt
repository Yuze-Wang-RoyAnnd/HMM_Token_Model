i went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. this is the only flick that i know of that tarsem singh has directed but boy was it intense. this movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.<br /><br />the characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. this movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. this movie compares to no other i have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. in that respect it is a fairly large step above `a clockwork orange.' definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape. it won't be half as good on tape.<br /><br />this movie is not for the easily freaked out. it will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget. but for those who like to be freaked out.....enjoy!
