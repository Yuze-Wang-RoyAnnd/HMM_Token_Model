the child's play series isn't a favourite of mine, but bride of chucky is actually an okay movie. this time we have two dolls chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) tiffany. together they go on a journey to find an object. there are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between chucky and tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre. this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies. all up even if your not a child's play fan give this one a go.
