"capt. corelli's mandolin" is an old fashioned hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity, and supposedly no americans. the story takes place on a greek island during ww2. the italians arrive to take over the island, but with german supervision. there is a romantic triangle made up of a greek couple and the italian captain. nice performances by all the actors; penelope cruz's best work yet.
