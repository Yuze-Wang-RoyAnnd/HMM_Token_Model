palwol ui christmas is very korean, if you have been to korea or have korean friends, you should know what i mean. korean are very traditional people, they see love very quitely. a kind of feeling you don't find in today's world. i think that is why this film is so special. it is wrong to compare this film with "love letter" by shunji iwai, japaness are very good but could never make one like palwol ui christmas. if you have a chance please see this movie for yourself.
