this movie gave me recurring nightmares, with alan rickman's voice representing an omnipotent, insidious, fascist ruler. the scariest movie i have ever seen - psychological terror more powerful than anything any "horror" movie has ever achieved. alan rickman's voice will always represent to me the power and terror of a totalitarian state, reminiscent of orwell's 1984. this movie describes to those who don't care the reality of a large part of current world governments. this film is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should watch it - it's a description of a reality that no one should ever have to experience, but so many do.
