another enjoyable warner flick. i really liked john garfield in this, though i'm wondering why cagney wasn't in the role. perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces? i mean, it's another dead end kids story of sorts too, but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. the boys work great with garfield. a nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.<br /><br />one negative comment: claude rains was grossly miscast. as the detective, the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse.
