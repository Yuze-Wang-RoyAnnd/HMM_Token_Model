ann-margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making. i felt as if she was mrs. frey. there might be one or two films of ann-margret's i have not seen since her film debut in "pocket full of miracles" with betty davis in 1961. i feel she has been totally under-rated in the industry. though she was nominated for an emmy award for this role in "who will love my children," she was overlooked. like she was nominated for an academy award for her roles in "carnal knowledge" and "tommy," she was snubbed. over all, i think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in "who will love my children." yes, it is a sad movie (as true stories can be), but well worth the time. thank you.
