this short was in part four of the "short cinema journal"--a film i rented from netflix but which appears to have originally been a monthly film series for people who like mediocre modern short films and love to have the dvd chock full of commercials. i have so far tried two of the journal's dvds and felt enraged at the horrible way that a viewer needs to navigate the disk in order to see the films. talk about an over-produced and overly complicated way of doing this! while i have and will continue to see as many shorts as i can, i really doubt if i'll bother with the journals because of these factors.<br /><br />now it could be that because i disliked the disk so much that i was not favorably disposed towards this portuguese animated short. this is definitely possible. however, even if this is the case, i feel that the other reviews were way too positive about this simple little film. some of the artwork was indeed nice--i liked how the simple black and white drawings suddenly became 3-d environments as the camera went from a dull distant shot and dove into the city below. this was lovely and took some work. but as for the story about a cat who wants to go to the moon, it just did nothing for me.<br /><br />important update--i saw this film again on a dvd entitled "cartoon noir" on 5/09. it was a pretty unappealing collection of art films. however, this time i saw the story of the cat and the moon with an entirely different audio track and boy did it make a difference. instead of portuguese with subtitles, it had a french accented narrator who spoke english in a film noir style. while i usually hate dubbing, this time it really made the film. the narration of the portuguese version leaves a lot to be desired if you don't know the language or understand the subtleties. unless you speak the language, try looking for the other version (provided you understand english).
