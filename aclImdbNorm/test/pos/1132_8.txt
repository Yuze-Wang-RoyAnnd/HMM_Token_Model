i'm not a big tv person... but when i saw the premier episode of greek, i couldn't wait until next week! i don't miss the show for nothing!<br /><br />thank god for dvr! lol i'm in love with cappie... he acts like a bad boy, but he is so sweet... everybody has their own character so, we have pretty much all types of people. you could still throw in a hispanic and a chubby persons.<br /><br />i didn't go to school in usa, so, i never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that, so, when my husband told me about the show i didn't pay attention, until he asked me to watch it and since i didn't have noting better to do, i agreed. i laughed so hard the first night that i just needed to keep watching it.<br /><br />so.. i'm with the other people that voted for this show to continue on! i will hope for a second, third and who knows how many more episodes! its a really good show, very funny and entertaining!
