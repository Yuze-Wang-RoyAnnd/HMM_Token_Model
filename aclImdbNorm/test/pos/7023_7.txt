jennifer grey seems the unlikeliest of romantic leads and that's probably the reason why this beloved film is such a sure-fire hit. it's all very well doing a version of montagus and capulets with sweeteners like dancing and schadenfreude-baiting jewish society family tropes thrown in but there usually has to be an x factor.<br /><br />swayze probably makes this film safe with his rugged, post-travolta moves and temperament but its being won over by this curly-mopped penelope pitstop teen that brings the dream in reach of the impressionable market. the super (dated? perhaps 'immortalised') soundtrack helps and of course the cunning conceit of setting the film in a resort away from day to day life altogether finesses the fantasy. 7/10
