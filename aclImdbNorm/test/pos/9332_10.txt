i am not a big music video fan. i think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song.. any song. in other words , creative thinking goes out the window. likewise, personal feelings aside about mj, toss aside. this was the best music video of alltime. simply wonderful. it was a movie. yes folks it was. brilliant! you had awesome acting, awesome choreography, and awesome singing. this was spectacular. simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man , but was he a man or something sinister. vincent price did his thing adding to the song and video. mj was mj , enough said about that. this song was to video , what jaguars are for cars. top of the line, perfecto. what was even better about this was ,that we got the real mj without the thousand facelifts. though ironically enough, there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around. folks go to youtube. take 14 mins. out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is.
