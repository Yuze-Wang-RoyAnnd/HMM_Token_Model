this show is sheer entertainment and doesn't try to be a greek drama. it certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists, but it's immensely engaging and fun. las vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with! anything and everything does happen there! the actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week. the show is also very funny. the humor arises from the characters and situations. not just thrown in gratuitously. it's a well-crafted show in that regard. it certainly makes me look forward to friday nights and i'm glad i now own the first two seasons on dvd!
