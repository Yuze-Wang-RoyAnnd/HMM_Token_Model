as with some of the best films and series, i stumbled across this quite by accident. it was late, a storm was in full force outside and i was sitting comfortably on the sofa when i flicked past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes. i intended merely to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to be finished on another channel before switching back to some or other sitcom. about an hour and a half later i remembered my resolve and was so happy that i hadn't done that. needless to say i made sure i saw all the other episodes.<br /><br />john hannah has been brilliant in almost everything i have seen him in and he does not let down here either. all other cast members do a stellar job too. my personal favourite (aside from john hannah, of course) is gerard murphy.<br /><br />the only negative side to this series are the limited amount of episodes. only 8 with jh himself and an additional 1 with someone else. i would love to see mccallum back on the screens, though it would have to be with jh!
