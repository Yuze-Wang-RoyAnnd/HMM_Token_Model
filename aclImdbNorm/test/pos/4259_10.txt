this film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. it was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the black power movement, vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.<br /><br />all of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.<br /><br />viewing it for the second time recently, i was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally. its humor is as funny, and its message as strong.<br /><br />and in viewing it now, you get all of this, while at the same time gaining the added enjoyment of its being a "period piece," and a superb chronicling of its this historic, turbulent time.
