i have some great memories watching "robin of sherwood" on tv as a kid (but i think i only saw michael praed's episodes, by some reason). and recently my brother bought the new released dvd-boxes of the complete series. it was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv-series. the cast is great, and the locations mixed with clannad's music adds this very special feeling. i personally think that praed is the best of the two robins, but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with. ray winstone, nicolas grace and robert addie is terrific in their roles as will scarlet, the sheriff of nottingham and guy of gisburne. it's a pity that a fourth season never got made, and i've also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. robert of huntingdon (connery) could finally have married marion (judi trott), or maybe herne the hunter could resurrect robin of loxley (praed), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. as have been mentioned before; if the producers of "robin hood: the prince of thieves" would have been smart, they would have got the cast from "robin of sherwood", and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. as ray winstone puts it in the dvd bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in sean connery's "robin and marian". who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. in any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!
