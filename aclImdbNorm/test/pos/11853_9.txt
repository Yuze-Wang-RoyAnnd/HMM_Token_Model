the best romantic comedy i've seen in years. not the kind of slick over the top hollywood stuff by ben stiller or adam sandler and a lot less syrupy than a hugh grant epic. julianne nicholson and jay mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage. instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action. nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much. we see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story. andy richter (earnest friend) and helen slater (distraught single-mom) are particularly good. there is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy-girl farce. indeed, with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy.
