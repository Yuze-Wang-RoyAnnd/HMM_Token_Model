i thought this movie was really awesome! one of drew's best. i am also a fan of michael vartan so i thought he was so hot in this movie. why all the bad reviews. i would want to watch this movie over and over again if i could. i also loved the ending. this movie clearly has shown a smile on my face! i was also surprised that james franco and jessica alba were in it. i love them both so i also highlighted this movie. at the end, when drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in high school. again, the movie was amazing. defiantly a 10/10. hope this comment was very useful to any imdb readers.
