based on its current imdb rating as well as several plot summaries, i didn't expect much from 'two hands'. but how wrong i was. <br /><br />from start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. if you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch. <br /><br />i'm hoping heath ledger's tragic death will have lead to more people picking up this film. he was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one not to be missed. don't make the mistake of judging and discarding this amazing film before you've seen it.
