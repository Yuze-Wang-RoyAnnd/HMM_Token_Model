the tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. dramatizes richard's discovery of "we've only just begun" and karen's marriage troubles admirably (the "superstar" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with neil sedaka, the contribution of tony peluso's guitar solos, etc. gibb is sweet in her karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real carpenter's personality. anderson is in fine form as the creative and take-charge richard, and fletcher makes her mark as the loving but overbearing agnes. the most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of "goodbye to love" in the background of a commercial displaying an anorexia hotline.
