turning isherwood's somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but somewhow it wasn't . the story moves at a zanily rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous, as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky weimar berlin. fun!
