i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie. the acting is astonishing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth.<br /><br />this is an important movie. it could be profoundly transformative.<br /><br />i would pay good money never, ever to see it again. because it *is* so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important. those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle.<br /><br />but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once. preferably with others, so you can talk to each other, and have someone around to remind you that there's more to the world than the movie.
