i found it charming! nobody else but kiarostami can do so little and, yet, get so much. you might think i'm weird, but i was so charmed that i couldn't speak during the movie. while during other movies i comment a lot. the short movie made by him for lumiere et companie, the one with the eggs, that one is unbeatable in my heart, but this is wonderful, too. i liked it better than ten. kiarostami is, maybe, the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! he doesn't need to use a lot of stuff "brought from home" to illustrate his images, he simply grabs a camera. not many can do that.. maybe i don't know to much about movies but i don't care about complicate stuff, all someone has to do is touch my soul. kiarostami does.
