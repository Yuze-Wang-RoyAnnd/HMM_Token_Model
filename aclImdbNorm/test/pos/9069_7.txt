peter lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place. the plot has a new government agent being put on the track of peter lorre's character. when the g-man's contact his killed by one of lorre's agents, the g-man is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story. lorre has the man paroled into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds. lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he isn't talking and a battle of wills is set in motion.<br /><br />this is a good solid little thriller that doesn't quite make a great deal of sense plot wise, but even so the film holds your interest. i had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to, instead i found the tale riveting enough i was up an extra 70 minutes. lorre is the reason that one falls into this. his quite demeanor is unnerving. he does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (watch how they light his cigarettes) that he is a bad dude.<br /><br />worth a look if you should run across it.
