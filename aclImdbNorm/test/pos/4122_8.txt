even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of black sabbath have not lost a thing. in this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including "n.i.b.", "war pigs", and "paranoid".<br /><br />also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. the comments of ozzy, tony iommi, geezer butler, and bill ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.<br /><br />a must-see for all sabbath and ozzy fans.
