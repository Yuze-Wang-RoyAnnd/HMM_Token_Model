this is one of the best films i've seen from the silent era (sad to say, i've yet to see too many with the exception of chaplin/keaton stuff). very visually brilliant, with insanely influential style in editing and composition. really unique (especially for its time) camera angles and extremely hectic editing. definitely a must see for the film nerd.<br /><br />the downside is that it is a bit too in your face about its politics (i have no problem with politics in film, as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat ignorable as a backseat to the story). also, it's not an "entertainment" film, which is fine, but it's not something i'm going to watch a billion times. this is art, plain and simple, like it or not.<br /><br />worth an a+ for influence alone, but based on personal enjoyment, i give it an a-.
