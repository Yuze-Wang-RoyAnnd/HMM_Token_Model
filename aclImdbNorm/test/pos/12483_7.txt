this film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever. the flics are straight but not without malice, the goods are transparent and evildoers are hardly there. even the "cabaret" are so naive they'll make you daydream with nostalgia in comparison to anything available on tv. blier is fine, if a bit one sided. louis jouvet is perfect, you just can't have a better copper. he has the best line: "my dad cleaned other people's dirt, and i do the same". susy delair is unbearable, but i guess in part it's the songs, wardrobe and hairdo. simone renant, on the contrary, makes a great femme fatale, if a bit silent. i didn't realize she may be a lesbian as imdb user dbdumonteil and others rightly suggest.
