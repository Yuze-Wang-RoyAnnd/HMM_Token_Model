alright, the first time i seen "talk radio" was in a video store for only $2.00 on vhs believe it or not, and i looked at it and i thought it might be about howard stern, because i just looked at it for about thirty seconds, then just didn't see it again. then i went to another store about a month later and i found "talk radio" on dvd for only $5.00. so i see it was directed by oliver stone, and i picked it up. so after the film was over i was speechless. i have never seen such a film like this. here's the main plot, then i'll tell ya what i thought of it.<br /><br />it is about a dallas talk radio host barry champlain, a jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and he interupts, and is taking everything seriously. now, a network wants to put his show live everywhere in the u.s. so barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like chet (a neo-natzi), kent (a rock n roll drugged kid), john (rapist), and others. now some of the callers sound like the same actor/actresses. but still i think it fits okay.<br /><br />now what i love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. the dark music in the background fits very nicely too. it has a flashback scene in the film also how he started with radio, which i think they did good on. <br /><br />but the great thing about the film is ending. i was surprised by it, and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful. it also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like dallas. one of oliver stone's underrated/weakest films mentioned, but i think it's his best in my opinion.<br /><br />but definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia-feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background. i still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored, as matter fact i watched it tonight. yeah, if ya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film, watch it at nightime with the lights off. i may sound crazy, but it makes the film better!<br /><br />another thing i forgot to mention is that the reason i don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title. 'talk radio.' it doesn't sound very tricky or anything, it's kind of plain. a better title like the book "talked to death" or maybe "the abusive radio host" or something catchy and not plain "talk radio". or maybe because of universal pictures? oliver stone usually didn't do universal i don't think. paramount might have been a good company. i don't know, something about this film didn't do so well, but i love it.<br /><br />"sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
