this is a new barbie movie. the graphics were really good. they made the movie seem partially realistic. i used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. this movie was kind of like a cinderella movie but a little bit different. a father of 12 princesses gets very sick. his cousin poisons him and wants the throne. the girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories. its up to them to save their father and society. with the help of their handsome prince. it was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it. we enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the indian talking parrot. the music was very nice and made the movie even greater. it had a great classical orchestra. the voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute. i liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family. all in all i'd watch it again.
