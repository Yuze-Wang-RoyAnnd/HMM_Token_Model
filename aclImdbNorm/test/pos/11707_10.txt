worth it for: if not for mick molloy's work, then for judith lucy. she brings her usual classy style of unbridled foul-mouthery to the role, and steals the show in parts.<br /><br />imho: i'm not much of an autograph hunter, but i have collected 3. the first is samuel l. jackson's, the other 2 are in this movie: tony martin and mick molloy. altho martin only makes a cameo appearance, molloy not only stars but co-wrote and co-produced this flick. i've been a fan of their for years now (apparently i was the only one laughing during the on-set urination in the first episode of the short lived the mick molloy show), so i went in to this with high expectations. i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed. with mick doing a lot of the work on this thing there's plenty of his usual trademarks. phrases like "blow it out your arse" and "these bowls are s***house" are all over the place, aswell as plenty of winnie blues being sucked down. it's also the sort of stupid, original story you'd expect from someone like him. this is like one of those cliqued, american, sporting comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something. but rather than trying to make a dull american sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport usually left to grey army: lawn bowls. but the main difference between this and other sporting type comedies is that this is actually very, very funny. what's even better is that even tho the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old folks game, it's never insulting to the elderly, and it never gets sickeningly soppy or anything. it's just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices. mick is great in the first real acting role i've ever seen him in, as is judith lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them have had a lot of practice... this is the best australian comedy i've seen in a long time. go see it and learn the joys of lawn bowls!<br /><br />it's a bit like: major league?<br /><br />score: 8 / 10
