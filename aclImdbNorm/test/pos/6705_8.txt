something i think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future. no other theatrical movie that i can recall predicted that when the space shuttle went to study halley's comet that a disaster would occur! some differences were: the "churchill" (the shuttle in the movie) actually went to the comet, the "challenger" was only in low earth orbit; the "churchill" was merely burned out inside, whereas the "challenger" exploded--hey the vampires had to get back to earth. one great similarity (and this is always bad luck!) both had mixed male/female crews--the legend of halley's comet and disaster continues!<br /><br />other than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasn't been said before. as a outer space/science fiction/horror/sex film individually it provided nothing really new, but as in all great dishes it is the combination that counts. and taken together, this was a highly original and satisfying combination.<br /><br />i just wish mathilda may would drain her victims through another part of the body!
