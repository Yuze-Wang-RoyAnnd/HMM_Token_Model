miles o'keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty ator in this the first sequel to the original film.<br /><br />what can i say? - this pretty much represents b-movie nirvana! <br /><br />the plot is ludicrous, the script is terrible, the acting is hammy throughout, the special effects....well let's not even go there! - all in all this movie is a veritable delight! <br /><br />highlights of the film include ator and thong (his mute companion, not his undergarments) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!), ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course, the infamous hangliding scene! <br /><br />there's one question i have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when ator supposedly destroys the geometric nucleus (as the narrator tells us)......how in the hell did ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! did he fashion some form of primitive timer/detonator or something? <br /><br />oh well, such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm - they just don't make them like this anymore!
