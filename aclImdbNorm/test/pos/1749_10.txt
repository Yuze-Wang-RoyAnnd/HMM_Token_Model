people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films.<br /><br />to be fair, those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well-done animated films, such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischer.<br /><br />you may be thinking to yourself, "well if it's so great, why haven't i heard of it?" fair question. this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor. the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity. things are looking up, though, because it has finally been released on dvd under the title "bugville".<br /><br />it's funny that the film went through all this, because it kind of mirrors the actual plot. although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), i personally think that the movie's main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times (after all, the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time).<br /><br />our grasshopper hero, hoppity, desperately wants to help his endangered community. problem: each time he tries, whether through the ill-will of others or through simple bad luck, he fails miserably...and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he's trying to save. although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook, he occasionally breaks down and it's only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight. just a healthy reminder that, when all is said and done, no one is really self-sufficient.<br /><br />"okay", you're saying. "it has a good message (two actually). does that really make it exceptionally well-done?" <br /><br />my answer: partially.<br /><br />it's not just the message that makes this movie special. it's the characterization. this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation. you almost don't even need the spoken lines. a good way to sum it all up is "energetic" or "lively". a lot of movies have used the selling point, "lovable cast of characters". whenever i hear that line, it always makes me think of this movie.<br /><br />case in point, the bad guys: swat the fly and smack the mosquito. many movies have "lovable" villains, but i don't think you'll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows. forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s. swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly (but sadly not larry) that you'll ever find. virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome. yeah, they're rotten no-goodniks, but you still care about them. that's the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer, director, and crew.<br /><br />the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes (native americans and chinese). i don't think they were intended to be malicious; but they're there, regardless. they didn't bother me, but it'd be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them.<br /><br />so, if you share my weakness (and i think you do), give this one a go.
