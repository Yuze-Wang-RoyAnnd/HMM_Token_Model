this is a cute little french silent comedy about a man who bets another that he can't stay in this castle for one hour due to its being haunted. and, once the guy enters the house, it looks much more like a crazed fun house or maybe like the after-effects of lsd!! while there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a weird menagerie of animals, odd special effects and gags as well. it's awfully hard to describe but the visuals alone make the film worth seeing. however, understand that the self-indulgent director also had many "funny gags" that totally fell flat and hurt the movie. his "camera tricks" weren't so much tricky but annoying and stupid. ignore these and keep watching--it does get better. the film is fast paced, funny and worth seeing. in particular, i really liked watching the acting and mugging of max linder--he was so expressive and funny! too bad he is virtually forgotten today. for an interesting but very sad read, check out the imdb biography on him.
