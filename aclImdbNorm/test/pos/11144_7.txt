an especially delightful film to those of us who saw this when young because after all it was meant for the young to watch - when viewing it again as an adult it's better if rose-tinted spectacles can kick in. it was the first of the 16 jungle jim films and later tv series chunky johnny weismuller went on to do for columbia (in the last 3 films he had to use his own name though as they'd lost the rights) after getting the sack from playing tarzan for sol lesser. johnny sheffield also gave up playing boy to become bomba the jungle boy in a series of 12 films.<br /><br />jim and party go on perilous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of zimbalu manned by an obscure tribe of devil doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that might also be a cure for polio. edgar rice burroughs probably approved. after 16 years talking monosyllabically weismuller seemed awkward stringing sentences together, not that it mattered. on the swift march we meet many of the interesting but generally playful denizens of the jungle, barring the sinister crocodile going to eat the leading lady with her leg caught under a twig and the surreal elephant stampede (stock footage squeezed into a corner of the frame). skipper the dog and caw-caw the crow had many adventures, none of which turned out essential to the plot in case you were concentrating! the biggest problem with the film is the farcical climax, which can be exciting but also unfortunately remind you of the end of a serial part
