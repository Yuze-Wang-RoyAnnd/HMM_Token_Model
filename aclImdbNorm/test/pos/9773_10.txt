changi has a delightfully fresh script, acted superbly by both young and old actors alike. john doyle has done an excellent job bringing humour to a tragic true story, keeping a sometimes sad story fun and engrossing, particularly to those of us not familiar with the events of south east asia during ww2.<br /><br />john doyle's parallel story line successfully bridges the gap between past and present, allowing the audience insight into the long-term effect war had on the prisoners and their family's lives as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative which nicely rounds out the tales, both individual and collective. doyle deserves praise for this effort. we have in the past been delighted by his abundant and quick-witted humour as evidenced in his long running collaboration with greg pickhaver as `roy & h.g.'<br /><br />as the series is approaching half way, we are looking forward to how the story develops with anticipation.
