i thought that this is a wonderfully written movie. i love little scamp, and the street-wise angel. this movie is very easy for little kids to understand, but a good movie for adults as well. i liked this movie because it continues the original lady and the tramp, and that movie is a classic. lady and the tramp 2 scamp's adventure was filled with new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animation, and unforgettable classic characters. i have loved the movie ever since i saw it for the first time. i also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. it also shows the downfalls and good things of making new friends that you can hang out with. my favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they feel. i definitely recommend this movie for everyone that was a fan of the original lady and the tramp.
