having been familiar with hartley's "the go-between" for a good while, both in its original book form and in its disappointing pinter-losey film adaptation, this was interesting stuff. "the hireling" proves almost a mirror image at times; set in a slightly less distant period for the main part, featuring exposure of the british class system, and containing a set piece sports match (boxing takes the place of cricket) that reveals rather a lot about .<br /><br />this refreshes in its small-scale, character focus. you do not exactly get to 'know' lady franklin and leadbitter in the novelistic sense, but this distance is appropriately played out in telling body language and inflection from the actors. your distance from ever fully sympathizing with any one true character mirrors the dormant 'difference' that so dooms the central relationship. miles and shaw are wonderfully subtle, and we see more in their 'less'; never once are these actorly, showy performances. they are fittingly stanislavskian interpretations that create the impression of these characters having life outsides the confines of the film. all other parts are very satisfactorily handled, though they are far smaller in this film than i presume in the novel and compared indeed to "the go-between", a stunning work about disillusionment. <br /><br />the disillusion at the centre of this film is so sadly and movingly conveyed in the late scenes where shaw kisses miles and is rejected, and then where a drunken leadbitter confronts cantrip and lady franklin. it's a howling shame that what would have been an incredibly poignant ending of spoiled, desolate lives at either side of the screen, is 'embellished' with a decidedly odd little coda. one is entirely bemused by the jump in tone, as shaw's leadbitter goes beserk and ironically sings "rule britannia" and "god save the queen" as he crashes his car into things. the political point is heavily over-egged by this bombastic, rather dingily operatic ending. all sense of subtlety, so effectively conveyed hitherto, is lost, as the implicit point is heavily and noisily made. agit-prop surely has no place in this sort of delicate period drama.<br /><br />overall, however, one cannot be too harsh. while this absurd end-piece is a major flaw, the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive, evocative film, of sadness and detailed observation about the way british society was in the past. hartley's languid but crystal-clear touch is very much in evidence throughout. it's just a shame that we don't end on the shattering conclusion to shaw's drunk scene. the tragic, deluded figure of sarah miles' lady franklin is abruptly denied her place at the epicenter of the film, as the excellent human drama bizarrely slips into the realms of political point scoring. shaw also - that most dry and yet deeply feeling of actors - is betrayed by the out-of-character excess that closes the film. thus; a fine, small-scale triumph is sabotaged; but we ought to remember the many good points.<br /><br />rating:- *** 1/2/*****
