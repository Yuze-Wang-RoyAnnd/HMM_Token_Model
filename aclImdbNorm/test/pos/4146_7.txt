where do i start. do i say how great the cinematography is. do i praise certain scenes which show the directors creativity. do i tell how realistic the scenes on ellis island are. should i mention that for a change we do not have the clich'e scene of viewing statue of liberty. (by now immigrants viewing the statue from the ships railing is a clich'e)<br /><br />now whats not likable, two major things, one being a modern song score & not even a good one to boot.<br /><br />second & nearly deadly the film is boring it moves so slow, that watching paint dry would be an improvement.<br /><br />the 118 minute running time is to long & yet the film seems unfinished. we see no scenes of this family in the us. our hero mentions he wants to find his twin brother, i would have enjoyed scenes of his futile of maybe lucky search, instead of other drawn out scenes.<br /><br />the film is a near miss.<br /><br />ratings *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) imdb 7 (out of 10)
