my wife and i saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much we wanted to see it again. it was so moving that i was calling it a tear jerker. the mystery that billings was sent to report on is really no mystery at all. angles!! it seems that ever time he turned around something happened to him, all good, and i believe it scared george a bit, considering that he did not realize what he had gotten into. it just goes to show that even the cold hearted can change with the right attitude around. if only we all could treat each other the same, the world would be a better place.to date we have been searching the net for a copy of it, now i finally have a connection to it, as soon as i can find a copy to buy i am going to grab it.
