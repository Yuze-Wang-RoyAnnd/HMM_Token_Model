ok. who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all slit their throats. this "film" was absolute and utter filth. what the heck was up with the weird old bags eyes? seriously, was she on some sort of horrible drug and then she like just thought she could control people? she was running around with her freaking evil eye and it was like what? do i have a booger hanging out of my nose? what are you staring at? are you like the sea witch or something? all and all though i thought the graphics were top notch old chap. for that alone i would give it a ten. but just cover your ears when you are watching it. the pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall off. who knows? you might even get a knot in your small intestine. you better watch out fools.
