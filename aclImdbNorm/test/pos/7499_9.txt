the best screen performance ever by george c. scott. the screenplay by chayefsky, the irony-freighted dialogue, is near perfect ('just where do you train your nurses, dachau?'). rigg is wonderful as the rescuing angel who saves scott from doom, as is the whole cast. it's a hilarious and serious movie. it is a movie of the period, the 60's, but it is not in any sense dated. what it is about, the chaos and irrationality of the system vs. the sanity of the individual, is timeless. and the "we heal nothing. we cure nothing" monologue (delivered, shouted actually, as no one else but scott could) with its references to cloning and other 'wonders' of modern science could literally have been written this morning.<br /><br />
