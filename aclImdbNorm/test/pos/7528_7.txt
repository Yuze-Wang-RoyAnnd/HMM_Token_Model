one day a red alley cat is fed up of being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if he were a skunk. he then paints himself black with a white stripe down his back and adds a bit of limburger cheese to make him stink. at first life couldn't be better for him, the dog flees and the butcher abandons his shop letting the cat walk off with a pile of meat. just as he is thinking everything is perfect he is noticed by a real skunk, not just any skunk but the overly amorous pep'e le pew. pep'e mistakes the poor cat for a female skunk and pursues him thinking his protestations are just shyness. our poor cat thinks he has escaped when he throws a skunk skin from a tall building so that pep'e will think he is dead, at first it seems to work but as he sneaks off pep'e sees him and instantly forgets the dead skunk. in the end the cat realises he was better off being kicked and attacked than being lusted after by a randy skunk... there is a nice ending for the skunk too when his wife finds out what he has been up to.<br /><br />this was a fairly funny introduction to pep'e le pew who back then was just overly amorous but now looks like a randy sexually harassing stalker, although he was punished for his behaviour in the end.
