after recently seeing, cry uncle, by the same director, i decided to seek this out and am i glad i did!? this is an extraordinarily good film. far, far better than it would seem likely given the ingredients. how many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle class dad mixing it with the flower children aagh! and yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made believable. not ideal, not good or bad but believable. peter boyle, as the working class, hippie and ni**er hater and dennis patrick as the uptight suit, play their respective parts immaculately and i can't remember ever seeing the two classes getting together like this without things getting sentimental. susan sarandon is effective as a hippie chick but doesn't have all that much to do in her first film. this is a truly, must see film capturing as it does that very short period in western and in particular us times when the counter culture was about to bust itself wide open.
