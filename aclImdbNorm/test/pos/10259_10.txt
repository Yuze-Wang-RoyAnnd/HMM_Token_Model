read this:<br /><br />boyz 'n the hood is a scene-by-scene, complete rip-off of this movie.<br /><br />two friends in the hood, one's focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. the friend who's an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed. (the athlete just happens to be washington from 'welcome back, kotter'.)<br /><br />it makes me mad that people don't know this. it blows my mind everytime i go into a video store and boyz 'n the hood is in the 'drama' section while cooley high is in 'comedy'. it's an embarrassing disgrace. this movie is both funnier and more dramatic than john singleton's rip-off. at least singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to cooley high, but no, he never said a word. boys 2 men, however, named their hit record after this film.
