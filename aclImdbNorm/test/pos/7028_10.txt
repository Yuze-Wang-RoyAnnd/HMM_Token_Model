i first saw this movie with my fianc'ee many years after it came out. i thought i would hate it, but to my surprise it is so cheesy that it's great. we've spent many hours reenacting parts of the movie ("sylvia?!yes mickey?" or "i'm sorry you had to see that baby. sometimes in this world we see things that we don't want to."). my financee cracks up every time i imitate neil. also the music is classic and fun to sing along with, especially on road trips. of course i don't admit any of this to my male friends. it's like a guilty pleasure. i seriously watch dirty dancing once a month or more and it is just as good every time. jennifer grey is also so cute in this movie. its too bad her career never really took off.
