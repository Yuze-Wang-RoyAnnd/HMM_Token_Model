nurse betty is really an interesting movie. i guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can't explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real persons.<br /><br />'nurse betty' isn't a nurse at all. in real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner. to escape from her awful husband and the problems in her miserable life, she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera. after she witnessed her husband being murdered, she goes into some kind of a shock and she loses all grip on reality. she thinks she's in love with one of the characters from the soap opera, a doctor, and decides that she'll visit him and start a family with him. the hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her.<br /><br />as i already said, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave the professional hit men and the murder out of it) and the movie was funny. the story was well directed and the actors did a fine job. it had everything i always want to see when watching a comedy. i give it a 7.5/10.
