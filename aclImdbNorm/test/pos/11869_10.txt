this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it. such a smart comedy! very precise yet easy. the casting can not be any better. all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best, and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie. layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly. the greatest of all is when the village people's ymca is cued in, it brings out the importance of the indian's statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie, which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies. i give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated.
