i saw this version about a decade ago, and have been looking for it ever since. i just recently found an original vhs version, and purchased it for $125.00. sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it as one of the best the broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice.<br /><br />why, it's just a little over paying for a broadway ticket today. i really hope they re-release this in dvd form soon. it's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all!
