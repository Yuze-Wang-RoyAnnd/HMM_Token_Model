as a long island independent film maker myself, and having have had two theatrical releases under my producing/directing belt i had always been told of how much i could learn by viewing a fred carpenter production so i was lucky enough to have his "eddie monroe" as my initiation to his superb budgeting, production, casting, settings and masterful directing talents. my heart went out to it's characters, it's story and was totally won over by the trick/switch ending that brought the film's plot to fruition! location's were marvelously chosen and human emotions in it's characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that mr carpenter utilized throughout, to his and his film's benefit!
