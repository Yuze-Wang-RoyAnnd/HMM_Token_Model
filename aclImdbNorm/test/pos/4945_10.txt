soul calibur is more solid than it ever was... with the new character creation, and the bad-ass chronicle of the sword mode on the home version.<br /><br />the arcade version is more complete, even though the character roster is smaller than the home version, this version is definitely the more pretty of the two, eliminating all of the "goofy/unrealistic" fighting styles found in the home version. if you were in any way disappointed with the home version, or perhaps thought it was "too much," you might find a much more likable and straight forward game of soul calibur in the arcade. think you have what it takes to become a legend?
