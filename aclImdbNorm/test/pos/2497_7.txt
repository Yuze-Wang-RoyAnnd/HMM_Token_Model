"the love letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants.<br /><br />it's not for all audiences. "the love letter", i feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet tone. never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. however, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.<br /><br />the cast is nice. it's great to see tom selleck again, and is such an underplayed role. and it's hard to believe this is the same kate capshaw we met 15 years ago in "indiana jones and the temple of doom". she's quite naturally good here; improving in every role i've seen her in since grating on indy's nerves. and is it possible capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age ? ( what is it about that spielberg!?)<br /><br />it doesn't amount to much; but after another noisy summer movie season i'll probably look back with brief fondness for this light-as-a-feather romance.
