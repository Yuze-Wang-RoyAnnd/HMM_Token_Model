i saw this superb documentary at the santa barbara int'l film festival. it is extremely absorbing and very well crafted, drawing you into the life and career of harry nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's. while i was familiar with his better known compositions ("one is the loneliest number", "without you"), i learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing. if you love music, you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world, which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him. however sad, he nonetheless was completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so glad to have met this man. the profile is effectively told through nilsson's own words and those of his friends and colleagues (a virtual who's who of rock)who loved and respected him. don't miss this!
