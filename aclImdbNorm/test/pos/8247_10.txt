i've seen this amusing little 'brit flick'many times. the only problem is its currently unavailable on video or dvd. i'ts certainly a contender for a dvd release. the much missed richard jordan plays 'pinky' an ex-pat american, whose just been released from prison,he finds himself a job as an electrician in a bank, it all goes well until he finds himself embroiled in a bank heist with his ex cronies, david niven plays the mastermind ivan, its an enjoyable little romp, hopefully studio canal or anchor bay, will come to the rescue. look out for john rhys davies before he struck it big with 'shogun' raiders of the lost ark 'lord of the rings' in a small role as a barrister,
