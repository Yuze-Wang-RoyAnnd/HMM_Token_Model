sweet, rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him, she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. very funny romantic comedy blends in elements of black comedy and '80's cheese that make this all the more fun to watch. the movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk; but her friends too as they shop, party, hang out, and go to the mall. if the dialogue doesn't have you laughing non-stop for a week, the music will. songs like "johnny, are you queer?" are found throughout. also, elizabeth daily is a funny, existential character and the prom king & queen speech at the end is hilarious!
