"one dark night" is a staple in the 1980's low budget horror genre. filled with retro puns, clothing and scenery, "odn" transports the viewer to a simpler time, when horror films were just that... horror!<br /><br />nothing so intense that you can't understand whats going on, the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead. well acted by it's stable of scream-queens, and a fine directorial job by tom mcloughlin, whom revels in the time and makes you believe what he's presenting. there is no "who done it?" and certainly no big twist at the end. it is straight-forward and in your face horror from beginning to end, with a lot of 80's humor thrown in for added spice. i give it "8" simply because some of the special effects fall short towards the end of the film, but at least there is no cgi... perfect film for new fans to the 1980's horror genre, or anyone looking to re-live a fun night of classic horror bliss.
