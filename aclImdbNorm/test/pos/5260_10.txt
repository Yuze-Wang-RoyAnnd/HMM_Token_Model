the people who don't like this movie seem to have some academic vendetta against it -- those of us who don't hold the original can totally enjoy it.<br /><br />my husband who had never seen the original said "i don't want to see a girly movie." i assured him that "the women" is just a great movie, not a girl movie. he had a great time. he was very glad to have gone and enjoyed it more than the "boy" movie we saw the day before "burn after reading." <br /><br />spoiler: i even think the new ending is better. maybe not quite as fun, but it was beautiful. at first i couldn't understand why they had made certain changes to the plot<br /><br />but when i got the end and debra messing gives birth and brings the first male into the movie, i cried. that's one thing to love about men
