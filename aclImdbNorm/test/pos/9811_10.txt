i'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film. when i first watched this i couldn't really make out the ending and that's the only part of movie that's seemed to lack depth and left me a bit depressed for awhile. then i watched it a second time and realised how great the acting was and was clueless as to why it received the meager attention it did at the time.<br /><br />unforgettable performances by the young mazzello and wood should have made this film a classic.<br /><br />although the it was probably intended to be a fantasy/drama by the original writer/director (evans), once donner took over he presumably made it with a more dramatical outlook especially the ending, which left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to bobby - was he killed?, did he escape & really do all those fantastic journeys?, or was it just an imaginary story woven by hanks to prove a point to the kids?<br /><br />but in all it didn't provide the closure of a happy ending that we are so used to in a children's film. perhaps it's because it's not just that.<br /><br />to see what may have been a more classical ending check out the official elijah wood site where you'll find the first rough draft script of the conclusion of the movie(presumably by the original writer)<br /><br />also a note of the music by hans zimmer which is one the best soundtracks i've ever heard, a mixture of childish and dark sentiments throughout the movie. a great cd to get hold of if you can.<br /><br />
