if a joke doesn't offend anybody, it isn't funny.<br /><br />the inki cartoons are offensive, no doubt about it. so is rap music. get over it. i suspect that any sane black person will find the inki cartoons hilarious, and that the people who are offended by them white people who still think black's need their patronizing protection against racist humor.<br /><br />seriously, the inki cartoons are funny. it saddens me that, not because anybody is really offended, but because somebody might, just might, be offended, i can't buy inki cartoons or the african queen or song of the south on dvd.
