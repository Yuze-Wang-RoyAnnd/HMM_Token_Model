i went to this film having no idea what to expect. i actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out. we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it.<br /><br />i only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. it's not as disjointed as liquid sky or as fanciful as forbidden zone. the original plot is very easy to follow. there's a lot of subtle humor.<br /><br />here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost: a big-brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society. suddenly a new person appears and there's no data on him (he appears insane). he may or may not be the second-coming of christ. the over-cautious government goes into a frenzy to find him and discover his true motives. the ruler is also obsessed with immortality.<br /><br />some scenes are frantic while others are completely low-key. we follow the lead character as he encounters all different kinds of people in society.<br /><br />i didn't need my consciousness altered to enjoy the film, but i know that some of my friends felt that helped.<br /><br />split was also filmed around santa cruz and san francisco.
