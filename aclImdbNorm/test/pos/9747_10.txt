the standard bearer of all movie serials, the definite good guy - flash gordon - versus bad guy - ming the merciless. though the special effects seem awful by today's standards, for 1936 they were top notch. but the essence of the story is the battle between earthman flash gordon (buster crabbe) versus emporer ming of mongo (charles middleton). crabbe and middleton are terrific in their parts. and the supporting characters playing dale arden, dr. zarkov, princess aura, prince barin, vulcan, and the rest are all very good. this serial is far superior to the 1980 movie, basically because crabbe is much much superior to sam j. jones as flash gordon.<br /><br />this serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials. no question about it.
