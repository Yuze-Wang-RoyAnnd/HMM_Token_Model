this film is a good start for novices that have never watched a 'silent film' and for those who believe that quality cinema started with their generations efforts. they are doing a disservice to themselves by not expanding their horizons. the 'silent film' is a art-form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and the stage, it can stands on it's own merits.<br /><br />the beloved rogue (1927) united artists is a fictionalized history of the relationship of french poet 'francois villon' and 'king louis xi'. through 'villons' prodding 'king louis' will defeat his nemesis 'duke of burgandy' minimize the feudal system and establish the king as head of the state and the beginnings of modern france.<br /><br />the cast is exceptional, lead by john barrymore (yes, drew's grandfather). for those who only remember him for the decaying actor 'larry renault' in dinner at eight (1933) or the ham in the invisable women (1940) this will be a revelation. fit, trim with the 'great profile' still in evidence he commands the screen. co-starring in his first american film is conrad veidt with his 'cadaverous spider' interpretation of 'louis xi'. this is a duel of acting titans, each not giving the other a inch. on a trivia note is character actor and dwarf angelo rossitto in his first film, his last, mad max beyond thunderdome (1985). there are other character actors who would continue in sound that are easily picked up on. <br /><br />united artists spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by william cameron menzies. costumes, props and sets are well done and not exaggerated like in a douglas fairbanks productions. there is a touch of reality here. the copy on dvd that we watched from 'delta entertainment' came from a good master. though not 'restored' its musical soundtrack was clear and the print only suffered from nuisance black-spots (dirt) and drop-outs. the only major damage at the end of the last reel from water. 'kino' also has a edition which may be of a better quality since they do major restorations on their prints. best check with them. in our opinion this is a 'must have' particularly if you have no 'silents' in your collection. this is a good place to start.
