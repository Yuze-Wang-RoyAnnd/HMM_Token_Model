i recently rented this video after seeing "final ascent" by the same writer. i wasn't prepared for how intense this film would get. i found it engaging from start to finish, and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime. the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence, but well-done. i highly recommend this picture.
