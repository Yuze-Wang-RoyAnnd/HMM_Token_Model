i am a history teacher and overall i was pleased with the movie. my teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.<br /><br />the battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. lloyd bridges as jefferson davis and hal holbrook as abraham lincoln stand out. we all thought phillip casnoff as bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. we all thought charles stole the show from orry and george.<br /><br />we will enjoy the movie again!
