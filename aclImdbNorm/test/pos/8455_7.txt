all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come. you have the stellar cast - michael douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free-spirit' role that pretty much launched his movie career, fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib, and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence. give them a hot-button topic about big business being duplicitous, and that's encouraging for a kickoff, but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream.<br /><br />the script is impressively taut, intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock. if you like 'whistle blowing' dramas, then this is not quite as good as "the insider", but the whole thing is more than nervy enough.
