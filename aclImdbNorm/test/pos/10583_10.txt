i just bought this movie yesterday night, and i love it. everyone did great acting in it, especially ryan dunn and bam margera. the whole plot was great, and as dunn said in the extras on the dvd, they made it seem like he was reliving the whole thing all over again. this movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies! i can't stop replaying scenes over and over again, just to see it again. i've never done that with any other movie. i would definitely recommend this to other people to watch, because it is such a great movie, and if you like bam margera, it's a perfect movie for you!! the little montages that they show in between every scene are just great. i think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie. they are very sad, with mostly music from the band 'him,' which of course is my favorite band.
