while most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'aliens' series, pitch black stands as a fine piece of sci-fi, and an excellent movie all around. perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting. this movie beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself, something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to. vin diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal. after all, the film is about riddick's (diesel's character) personal journey, so thankfully vin doesn't drop the ball. the remainder of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous claudia black) were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances, animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms. pitch black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget. the special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'. it's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provoking story, rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of science fiction.
