when the new outer limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. as the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. the six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.<br /><br />since the outer limits always preaches a moral. i would like to offer my own. starting with the most entertaining to the flops.<br /><br />1. afterlife: as an institution, the u.s.a. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid. however, individuals with great integrity do serve our country, and they will obey their conscience even at a mind-boggling cost! in the end, the aliens don't need to say a word. those without a conscience are fools who are to be held in utter contempt!<br /><br />a truly subversive episode! one that should be shown on prime time television for all to see! this might be a revelation for some, but folks without a conscience should not be allowed to serve in our military! nor do the ends justify the means! <br /><br />2. relativity theory: a good person may be forced to make a split-second decision between good or evil in order to save the lives of defenseless intelligent beings, and at great cost to one's self. what makes this decision all the more difficult is the stark choice: being marooned with exotic alien strangers who you can't even communicate with except through gestures, or going along with a group of people you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers even if they are ruthless, and devoid of compassion! <br /><br />this episode is brilliant! what fuels this depravity is good old fashioned greed. this episode is one of the most scathing indictments of capitalism, transnational corporations and raping the environment, i have ever seen in my lifetime! unlike real life, justice here is served - and swiftly! <br /><br />one of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate thug said something to the effect, "we did the same thing in the amazon rainforest war." alluding to the killing of amazonian indians who were attempting to protect their rain forests from being strip mined, as justification for killing again literally in the name of the "survival of the fittest." something darwin never meant to be taken literally! <br /><br />3. alien shop: tremendous power can be used for good, even from an exotic alien. this power can be used to heal instead of destroy. mere mortals can learn from their mistakes! even a criminal can see the light if given enough opportunity to do so.<br /><br />sometimes it takes strong medicine, but we all can wake-up and change our self-destructive ways! <br /><br />4. the grell: an alien can be a christ-like figure! in the distant future, slavery can be justified, once again, in the name of expediency! basically good people can be corrupted. sometimes a person needs to be experience great shame in order to see the evil he/she is committing. children are closer to the truth than adults. those with political power have tremendous responsibility! another work of genius! as a species, "do human beings learn from history?" <br /><br />flop number 1: quality of mercy: loose lips, sinks ships! when in war kindly keep your mouth shut about important military plans. gee, did i really need to watch an hour-long soap opera in order to figure this out?!! i wonder, did the makers of the outer limits run out of ideas, or did corporate pull the plug? dark and ugly, serving no purpose, but despair! <br /><br />flop number 2: beyond the veil: so bad there is no moral but this: when locked-up in a mental hospital, use some common sense, please! this episode is so bad it disgusts. what an x-files rip-off! don't waste your time on this one! you'll thank me later! <br /><br />it's a sad commentary that the outer limits went down the tubes toward the end of its run. subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! it was a miracle they were made at all! hopefully, someday, other brave souls will follow the subversive outer limits tradition into new territory! <br /><br />if you happen to be such a daring person, a good place to start is with one unique book: "anatomy of wonder: a critical guide to science fiction," edited by neil barron! as far as i'm concerned, the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject.
