the sad thing about frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life. what is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny.<br /><br />the frontline team in series one consists of brian thompson ( bruno lawrence )- a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets. occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer emma thompson ( alison whyte ); a woman who hasn't lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on occasions. the same cannot be said of reporter brooke vandenberg ( jane kennedy )- a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her- so much so that when interviewing ben elton she needs to be instructed to laugh. her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities ( with whom she has or hasn't 'crossed paths' with before ) or scandalous unethical reports that usually backfire. martin de stasio ( tiriel mora ) is the reporter with whom the team relies on for gravitas and dignity, as he has the smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him. his doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story, though he does draw the occasional line. parading over this chaos ( in name ) is mike moore ( rob sitch ) an egotistical, naive reporter who can't see that he's only a pretty face for the grubby journalism. he often finds his morals being compromised simply because brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest.<br /><br />frontline is the sort of show that there needs to be more of, because it shows that while in modern times happiness, safety and deep political insight are interesting things; it's much easier to rate with scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.
