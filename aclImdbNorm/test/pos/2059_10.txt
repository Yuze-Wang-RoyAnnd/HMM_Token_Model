this film is a great rampage of action and comedy, it gets right in to it right from the start, there's no boring build up. the chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. the special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions. the story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details, to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment.<br /><br />
