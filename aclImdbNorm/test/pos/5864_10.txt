i remember this film as the other person that commented said. i recorded over it but wish i had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever. funny, in a real bad way. i remember the tag line on the box was "the ultimate frontal lobotomy". i got it from my mom, who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / cheesiest movie she had ever seen, so my mom said "my son will probably love it." and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession. i then later taped over it, which i regret. i also remember the "corck screw" thing was one of those ball catcher things.... the yellow cone shaped things, with a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red thing, it sends a ball flying. well, they used that with a crank on one end, and a corkscrew in the funnel. when the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the "weapon" and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head. i don't know what else to say about this "gem" except that if you like bad films, it doesn't get any worse than this.
