25 sitcoms had big screen spin-offs. most of these came in the 1970's. here is a list of all: are you being served, blackadder, bless this house, bottom, dads army, father dear father, for the love of ada, george and mildred, the league of gentlemen, love thy neighbour, the lovers, man about the house, nearest and dearest, never mind the quality feel the width, on the buses (3), please sir, porridge, rising damp, steptoe and son (2), that's your funeral, till death us do part (2), up pomeii (3), whack-o, whatever happened to the likely lads and whoops apocalypse.<br /><br />so there was a big-screen spin off of my all time favourite sitcom dads army. what the film focused on was when the men were enrolled. it showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons. it was a big summary of the first series of dads army. at the end of the film they catch some german spies in the church. the home guard come dressed as alter servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the germans. the best bit in the film was when they were showing a hg lecture and a german lecture at the same time: german: head office on the phone, would you get 10,000 bombs, (cut to home guard) godfrey: mrs mainwaring on the phone, would you get 1/2lb of brussel sprouts.<br /><br />this was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie, beaten only by till death us do part (1969). it would have been better if at the start of the movie, it had already been formed, it was half way through the war. though still an excellent movie, a good one for the family.
