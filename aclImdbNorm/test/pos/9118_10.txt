i saw the d's new film tonight at a special advance screening, and i was so blown away by its sheer greatness that i felt i had to come onto imdb and get the word out. admittedly, i was already a huge fan of the d's work - i loved the hbo series and listen to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing along to), but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight's screening (for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen). with tenacious d's "the pick of destiny," this is not the case.<br /><br />simply put, this film rocks harder than anything i've seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything peter jackson, pixar, and will ferrell together could produce. it tells the story of the d before we came to know them, setting up intriguing histories of kage and jables' upbringings, their comings together, and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as lee, sasquatch, and dio. most importantly, they reveal the true inspiration to the greatest song in the world, "tribute," and how it came to be (which is different than the hbo series' version). after you've witnessed it you probably won't be able to remember it (hence the tribute), but your mind forever be changes by its genius.<br /><br />i don't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking, paying outrageous concession prices, etc., but i usually make exceptions when it's starring someone i really love or concerning something of the the same variety. "the pick of destiny" was so good that i have no qualms going back to see it again when it releases nationwide, and i plan on convincing all of my friends to go, too. last week we saw "borat" and loved it, but this is honest to goodness ten times better. for anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance, see this film. these guys' talent is so great you should have no hesitation supporting their cause. you will not be disappointed, and the rock lords will smile upon you favorably.
