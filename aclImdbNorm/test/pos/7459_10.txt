i first saw this film by chance when i was visiting my uncle in arizona about 3 and 1/2 years ago. the vhs print was a little faded looking, but i was very haunted by what i had watched. did it all make sense? well, honestly, no it didn't. however, this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects. the beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression.<br /><br />well, when i found out that anchor bay had released this oddity on dvd, i picked it up immediately. i was very pleased by the transfer, though i felt the extras rather lacking. though the film concerns the "o" and sir stephen characters, it really has nothing to do with pauline reage's original novel or the 1974 film the story of o. however, the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind. "o" decides to prostitute herself for sir stephen in violent 1920s hong kong. her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men. naturally, sir stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress. however, the tables are turned when "o" actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. suddenly, sir stephen feels the threat...<br /><br />i feel that the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic score and artistic direction) really make this film a classic. the viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of "o"'s fellow brothel mates, but the turmoil of 1920s hong kong is also explored. like the political setting, the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging. no one is happy in the film, even if they believe that they are. (however, "o" does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer). one prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk, naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog. another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. she cannot let that vision go. she treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. <br /><br />as for "o", she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle. when he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. of course, in that same flashback kinski suddenly becomes her father. i was very, very disturbed by this image. i truly felt for "o" at this point in the film. she hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why. her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees sir stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love. <br /><br />another curious aspect of the film is the young child (that ages at the end) that sells fortune in a box. it is a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film. at one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. now, if that isn't symbolism for you! (laugh) <br /><br />all in all, i really love this film. i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience. it has erotic scenes, but the scenes aren't really meant to arouse. like the lives of the characters, the sex acts are empty. they are motions, but lack feeling and tenderness. (once again, the only tender scene is between "o" and the young man). "o" believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor, however, she finds in the end that she has choices. she too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness, however, she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew. the director leaves a lot of unanswered questions, however, some things don't need answers. the viewer will make the judgment that works for them. <br /><br />i must say that i wish a special edition of this dvd would be released that had director commentary. i think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later. it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released. this film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score. there is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine. i can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music.
