let me say first of all that i spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before i realized i was totally uncoordinated. i've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on 'em do their stuff, but i've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport. that being said, i thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary. some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit, but what the hell? it looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up. it's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in california provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. i never would have realized where extreme skating came from, but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. i'm sure it's at least a tad biased, but aren't all documentaries? worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970's.
