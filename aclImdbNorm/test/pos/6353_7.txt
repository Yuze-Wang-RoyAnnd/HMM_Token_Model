hummmm,...another keystone comedy set in the park!!! it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park, as so many of chaplin's and arbuckle's films are set there! and, while this is yet another one, it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it.<br /><br />fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel normand. i think she's supposed to be a little younger, though in her mother's eyes she is too young to be interested in men. well, fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun. things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift,...and many problems result.<br /><br />decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film.
