being a huge die-hard monkey island fan, i fugured this one would be terrible since ron gilbert didn't make it. boy was i surprised! although it's still not as good as the first two, it has the comedy that i wanted. i was a little nervous about the new graphics, new scumm engine, and just the fact that it was on a cd. but it all came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. i especially enjoyed that sword fighting had returned. and the whole story about finding the big uncursed ring was just incredible. go ahead and try out this two-cd adventure. and now we can rejoice, because monkey island 4:escape from monkey island is coming out really really soon! this fall!
