i caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television. i expected to only tune in for a few minutes, but found myself intrigued by the movie. i ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling. the acting by the three american leads was quite good, especially that of alex cord. he plays a gunslinger with quite a degree of vulnerability. very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. he ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. the final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet out of clay mccord. somewhat gruesome, but realistic. i must admit that, despite my initial misgivings at watching a "spaghetti western", i ended up enjoying this film quite a bit. i would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.
