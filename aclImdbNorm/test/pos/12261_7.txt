from producer/writer/golden globe nominated director james l. brooks (terms of endearment, as good as it gets) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter/anchor/journalist or producer might be like. basically jane craig (oscar and golden globe nominated holly hunter) falls for new reporter tom grunick (oscar and golden globe nominated william hurt), but correspondent aaron altman (oscar nominated albert brooks) also has strong feelings for her. the network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. also starring jack nicholson as anchor bill rorich, moonraker's lois chiles as jennifer mack, mrs. doubtfire's robert prosky as ernie merriman, school of rock's joan cusack as blair litton, peter hackes as paul moore, christian clemenson as bobby, robert katims as martin klein, ed wheeler as george wein and stephen mendillo as gerald grunick. the comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has it's moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. it was nominated the oscars for best cinematography, best film editing, best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen and best picture, and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy/musical and best screenplay - motion picture. it was number 64 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!
