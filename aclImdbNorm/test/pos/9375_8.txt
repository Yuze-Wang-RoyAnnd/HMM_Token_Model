a bigoted soldier kills a man for being jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier. not as good as the novel it was based on ("the brick foxhole") in which it was a gay man who was killed...but hollywood wouldn't touch that in 1947. that said, it's still a very good film. the anti-semitism is handled very well, but it's hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad...well duh! but this was 1947. the picture is well-acted by the entire cast (especially robert young and robert ryan) and the tone is very dark...as it should be. very atmospheric too. a deserved big hit in its day...well worth seeing.
