i found this movie to be educational, entertaining and very moving. i was impressed when i learned of just how much justice arbour had contributed in during her time in kosovo.<br /><br />wendy crewson is highly under rated and it is good to see her again in a canadian production. other easily recognizable stars are leslie hope (24) and john corbett (sex in the city.)<br /><br />while the story line of this movie may not be completely factual it did leave me with the desire to learn more about the word of arbour. a great movie for inspiring young women.<br /><br />i say the movie is a "must see."
