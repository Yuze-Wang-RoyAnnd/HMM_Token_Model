lauren himmel's debut movie is well directed with a nice polished feel to it. there's a strong storyline going on with a meaningful point to it all even if at the end nothing is resolved hence the name treading water. the storyline revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with ones mother for acceptance. 7.5/10
