surface, from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. on one hand, it seemed so high-concept and plot driven that to the passerby it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture (or several). plus, it felt like it was nbc's attempt at a "lost-killer". on the other hand, one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of lost seemed intrigued.<br /><br />so, after one (and possibly only) season on nbc, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault, on sci-fi, or filling a gap in nbc's lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. its ratings were some of the better on the network (which isn't saying much), but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its future.<br /><br />so, is it worthwhile? yes.<br /><br />surface follows a continuing story format, driven by plot with next to no filler episodes. almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot, much like a motion picture. no filler episodes, which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode. yet, the show's double-edge helped made up for that; big things seem to happen every episode, but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and you're left wanting more! that trait of the show, though shows how great it is. the cast is solid; the three main leads, including the beautiful lake bell as laura daughtery, put in a solid performance every episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding/studying the creatures. the supporting cast, including ian anthony dale and the brief performance by rade serbedzija fill out the cast well. the story is slow to start (my one regret; it doesn't really pick up until a 3-4 episodes in to the short 15-episode season), but the latter half of the season makes up for it. the visual effects are stunning (one's jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures 'attack' a ship), as well.<br /><br />many of the show's problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode.<br /><br />in short, if you've missed the first season and you're curious, go back and watch it. it's no twin peaks in terms of quirkiness, but the high-concept nature of it puts in in league with that, lost, and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. enjoy it.
