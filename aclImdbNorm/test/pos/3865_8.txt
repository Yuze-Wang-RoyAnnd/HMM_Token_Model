no. i'm not kidding with this one. he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave this movie positive marks. and who can blame him? this is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny disney movie. who doesn't love kittens? the music in ev'rybody wants to be a cat is jamming. it makes me want to snap my fingers or something. only years later when cats don't dance came out have i seen a movie that was that musically fun. what aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm. plus, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain isn't all that scary. it's perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can't like it. if snoop was here, i'm sure he would say the same thing. yeah. dig those crazy cats, man.
