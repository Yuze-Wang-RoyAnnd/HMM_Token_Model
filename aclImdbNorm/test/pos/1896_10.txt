this movie is funny in more ways than one. it's got action. it's got humour. it's got attitude. it's got dolemite's all girl army of kung-fu hos! and that's just what the movie offers as a film. it's also badly acted by some, the mic makes more than one cameo appearance, and some "punches" miss by feet. but when you make a movie this cool, who's got time to pay attention to those "details"? this movie rocks. rent it tonight, if you can find it... i had to buy it to see it, but i don't regret it!
