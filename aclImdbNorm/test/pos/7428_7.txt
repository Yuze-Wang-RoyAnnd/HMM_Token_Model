this was the third time i tried to watch this film. the previous two times, i found the beginning so sickeningly sweet and "schmaltzy" that i just stopped watching. however, now that i am a little older and more compulsive, i forced myself to watch all the film and i was very surprised to see that i actually liked it quite a bit. so, i look at the movie much the same way i would look at swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees centigrade for all those metric-lovers out there). sure, the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you'll get used to it--so resist that urge to jump out right away!! <br /><br />the film begins with a lengthy exchange between flynn and his daughter, played by a lispy patti brady. some may find there conversations very cute and endearing, though others may find them a bit hard to take since these moments are so gosh-darn sweet! in a way, it was some amazing acting by flynn because it's hard to imagine him in real life having kids or acting domestic especially that he wanted to be faithful to one woman in this film--now that's acting!! never say goodbye concerns the divorced couple, flynn and parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. since they both love each other as well as their lispy kid, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will once again tie the knot. however, there are some serious problems standing in their way: lucille watson (who plays her usual over-bearing and controlling mother-in-law character), flynn's girlfriend (after all, he is errol flynn and he is divorced, so you gotta expect him to have a girl somewhere) and a marine (played by forrest tucker).<br /><br />not unexpectedly, all this does get worked out by the end and everyone lives happily ever after. however, despite it being formulaic and predictable, the film is a winner because it is so much fun to watch. flynn, despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, is very good with comedy-romance and it's just a lot of fun to watch him. also, the film has the ever-scene chewing cuddles sakall--he's just so gosh-darn cute and sweet that he is perfect in this type of film. and, despite the sweetness, the film is pretty well-written. the bottom line is the film is fun.<br /><br />so my recommendation is that you do watch this film and force yourself not to retch at the sickeningly sweet aspects of the film. once you've gotten over this, the rest of the film is a picture that is well worth your time.
