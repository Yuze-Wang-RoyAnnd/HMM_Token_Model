after the funeral was absolutely superb, and by far the best episode of the season. i was disappointed with cards on the table, that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour, and i didn't know what to think of taken after the flood, though i do remember being confused at the end. after the funeral as i've said is one of my all time favourite poirot episodes, up there with five little pigs, sad cypress and the abc murders. i was afraid that they would ruin the story, but instead it is very faithful to the book. now i will say i don't mind changes to books, and try not to compare movies and tv adaptations to their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it justice. that's why i disliked some of the marples like nemesis and sleeping murder, and so far out of the poirots the murder of roger ackroyd, taken at the flood and cards on the table are the only ones that really did disappoint. everything else ranges from good to outstanding, even the recent appointment with death, despite the many deviations from the book, which i admit isn't a favourite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the marvellous production values, stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score. back to after the funeral, the production values are fantastic. it has a really cinematic feel to it, and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes. the music was very stirring and even haunting, and the entire cast give wonderful performances. david suchet is impeccable as always as poirot, and geraldine james and anna calder marshall are just as terrific. but for me, the standout was monica dolan as mrs gilchrist, she is up there with donald sumpter and polly walker as the best supporting actor/actress in a poirot episode, that's how good her performance was. all in all, a must see, one of the best poirot episodes by far, and one of the more faithful ones too. 10/10 bethany cox
