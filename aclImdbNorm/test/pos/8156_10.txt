this is an all-around superb film. a moving experience filled with real life emotion. there's lessons to be learned here about love, sex, work, religion and american culture regardless of one's sexual preference.<br /><br />while this film is also a scathing indictment of the mormon's (church of latter day saints) belief system, any conservative faith could easily take its place. but it's a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the mormons in no uncertain terms. here's a faith that mandated for generations that believers practice polygamy! and these true believers only gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government in order for utah to join the union. talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /><br />the sex scenes portrayed in the unrated version are tasteful, and surprisingly brief. there's nothing here that would offend anyone with an open mind.<br /><br />what this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural to people who are gay, as heterosexuality is to people who are straight! while love and sex are obviously quite different needs, its absolutely beautiful, beyond words, when both occur at the same time between two adults! profound erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts! my congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done!
