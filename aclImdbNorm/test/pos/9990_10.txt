oh my god what a story! this movie is very good and it had to be god who had this happen! you did a awesome job.the acting was really good you picked the right actors for sure. this movie is so good i am really glad you made this because if you had not then i would have never ever known about this story because i am not a big golf fan and i think it is kinda boring so thank you. i really enjoyed it and that is why i gave the movie a 10\10.i liked shia labouf too he was perfect for the roll of fransis quimet. i hope most of that stuff you put in there was true also. oh and some parts were funny and others i was just really happy.
