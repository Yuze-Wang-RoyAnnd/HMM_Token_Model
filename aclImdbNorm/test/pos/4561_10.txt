the banter and humorous rescue scene help to make this one of my favorites of the 14-movie series. wonderful acting, great cast. and this movie contains one of the few oft-noted facts about sean bean's career. the part where he and alice krige fall off the horse into the water was not scripted but was left in since they both went right on acting after it happened.<br /><br />this is a good follow-up to the intense ending of sharpe's enemy.
