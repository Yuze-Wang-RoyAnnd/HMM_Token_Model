it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether "anna" was really tsar nicholas's daughter anastasia. since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book. despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released, i sometimes still think she was. such is the power of amy irving's acting in this 2-parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts, but packed to the brim with tear-jerking drama and irving's totally convincing performance.<br /><br />i was not consciously aware of irving before this, though i must have seen her without realizing it in "carrie" (another favourite film). in "anasasia", i never felt for one moment that "it's only a film". for me this woman was anastasia, and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family, i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part. i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be, and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrison's character, though i greatly admire him as an actor.<br /><br />when i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide, i convinced my mother that we should watch it, and afterward she thanked me for doing so, being almost as keen as i had been to watch part 2. then i bought the video and can totally recommend it. "anastasia" is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv, and it doesn't really matter whether you believe the legend or not.
