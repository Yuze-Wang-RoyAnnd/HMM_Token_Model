this kind of angst can only be inside a young person who seeks very seriously his religion and his place in this world. as the text in the beginning of the movie says, these pictures are dead: they are the past already, and have been right from the moment when the product was ready. but that is only for the maker of these "products": maybe to somebody, who is in the same frame of mind (i think very many people, at least of those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible angsts and doubts in their personal development). and that, of course, is the reason that art is made in the first place: identification and consolation amongst fellow human beings.<br /><br />this film uses very well the "classic" technics of the experimental cinema. and this is where those technics are to my opinion in the best possible use: as an instrument in telling stories and creating atmosphere to them, not just as a pure abstractions or as an end in themselfes. those "tricks" have already been made many enough times. some other movies that i imagine have influenced/inspired this director, are "eraserhead" and "nosferatu". it's interesting how these technics make this movie totally timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this movie. or nothing from any other specific time either. it could have been made a thousand years ago.<br /><br />it is interesting in this story how these people treat this new born holy child: they use it selfishly in their own purposes, and don't even try to listen to him. they beat him, rip off his intestines and castrate him. they drag his (living) body forcibly from place to place. and they do the same kind of violence to his mother. the story also reminds me of the borges' short story "el informe de brodie". also the critique towards the practices of the christian institutions reminds me of the great "el topo".<br /><br />unpleasant watch at times, but beautiful. very simple, thought and concentrated. very strong movie, almost too strong. the whole human energy has been concentrated to this. also this movie shows that when you have the passion and ideas, you can make a movie with a round zero budget.<br /><br />but i have to admit, it was a bit hard to watch for a "contemporary" viewer like myself, because of the experimentality. it was so slow and demanding. but after all, worth the suffering. i have to give ten points just for the effort that somebody makes this kind of movie.
