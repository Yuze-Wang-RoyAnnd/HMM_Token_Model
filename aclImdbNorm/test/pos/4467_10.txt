this is lucio fulci at his best. if only all the films he made after were like this.<br /><br />this extraordinary film is as intriguing as dario argento's "the bird with crystal plumage"... <br /><br />if you're an argento fan but you don't like lucio fulci films, like<br /><br />"the beyond", "manhattan baby", "the house by the cemetery", etc. this one has nothing to do with the others... this is what the italians call "giallo"... that would be something like a "who-done-it" movie in a nutshell.<br /><br />you won't know who the killer is until the last moments of the film.<br /><br />but apart from that, there's the plot: some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys... a journalist (tomas milian), a sexy young woman (barbara bouchet), a priest (marc porel), his mother (irene papas) and a witch (florinda bolkan) are the main characters in this tangled, bloody story.<br /><br />talking about the actors, i want to say that tomas milian is superb (like always), and florinda bolkan is terrific as the village witch...<br /><br />do you want to know who is the killer?... <br /><br />i cannot tell you... but i can tell you that you must see this film!.<br /><br />(10 out of 10)... of course!
