the last american virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies that i really enjoyed. the subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that hollywood was (and still is) cranking out these days. but for awhile, the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasn't toned downed or soften for the kiddies. the men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from cannon.<br /><br />three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school. they'll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal. the sensitive one of the group (andrew monsoon) what's to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get. one day, the kid finds his perfect girl (diane franklin). but fate would play one of their foul tricks. his best friend moves on in and sweeps her off of her feet. after knocking her up, the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion. he still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl preggers. still, he tries his best to get her to love him. the night comes when he pops the question to her. but his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend. in tears, the kid leaves the party.<br /><br />what i enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches. instead of being filled with phony situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. the movie's filled with it's share of funny moments and hysteria. i have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comedies.<br /><br />highly recommended.
