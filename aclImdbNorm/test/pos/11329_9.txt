for those who like their films full of exploding planets and extreme violence, this is definitely not one to see. in fact, there is very little plot at all (or, at least, very little that could not be summarised in a few seconds: a meets b. mr a falls for mrs b and has an affair with her. a and b then fall in love and wonder (at great length) whether to have an affair themselves).<br /><br />this is cantonese visconti. story there is none, but what you do get is a succession of wonderful images and poignantly trivial music which convey the slow passage of the central characters' emotions. there is also the chance to see one of the world's most beautiful women in a succession of stunningly elegant outfits. for my money, it's worth seeing for that alone. how could this woman ever have been an action heroine? she looks as though she has stepped straight out of the pages of vogue.
