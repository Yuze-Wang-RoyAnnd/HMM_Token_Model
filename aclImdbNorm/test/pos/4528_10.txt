how many reviews of this film will i have to write before i get it right? tom conway fully inherits the mantle of the falcon from his real-life brother george sanders with this entry. decked out in beautiful double-breasted, single-buttoned, drape-style suits and cruising in gorgeous, 110%-steel cars with huge fender skirts and suicide doors that come up to your armpit, conway travels from new york to miami to keep a formula for industrial diamonds from falling into the wrong hands. his "client" is lovely, virginal louisa briganza who has got gorgeous hair but will let you only kiss her for the first two months. along the way he runs into the type of colourful array of characters only a b movie could provide. his sidekick in this outing is perhaps best among falcon sidekicks edward brophy as goldie locke who is given some really funny lines. he runs into sinister dish doris blanding, the type of '40's chick that you know puts out. her cohort is benny played by steve brodie who, twenty years later, was a presley punching bag in two paramount king movies. they both work for cold fish and yachting-cap-wearing kenneth sutton, ready to do what it takes to get the formula as he cruises his yacht to brazil. saddled with the stoniest falcon-pursuing cops ever, this entry still reigns supreme. forget those 120 minute melodramas, give me a 1 hour falcon movie any day. i got a wife and two kids - who's got time for a two-hour movie? shake up some dry martinis and forget your troubles with this great falcon movie. but if you didn't tape it off local tv in toronto like i did 17 years ago, you're out of luck.
