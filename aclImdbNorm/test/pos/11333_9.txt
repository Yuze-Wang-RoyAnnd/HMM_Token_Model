how do you describe perfection? in-the-mood-for-love! maggie cheung and tony leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre. every scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection, top-notch acting, and the sensual soundtrack. nat king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie. maggie and tony look marvelous, with maggie slinking about in some truly glorious cheongsams and tony always looking dapper. i've seen this movie several times already, and everytime i see it i find something new to rave about. love it!
