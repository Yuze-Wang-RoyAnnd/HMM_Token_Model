i, as many imdb patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the canadian "showcase network". i was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. i was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. i was coasting along comfortably on a sort of "kevin smith meets killer films" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail... with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. far from being taken out of the experience, i was brought further in. this is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal... so i do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. but i bought in... and enjoyed it immensely. the "flash back" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. i was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. this movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. a kind of male brigitte jones for the literate sect. take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into wirey's world... or you could go rent "you've got mail", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway! those of us who did like it will be alright without you on our side...
