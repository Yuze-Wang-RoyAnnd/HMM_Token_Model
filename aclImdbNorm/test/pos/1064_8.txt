make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck, this film is a fun one to watch. they really work well together as you would see in this movie. the whole cast was very entertaining. since i'm a dennis morgan fan, this film was a real treat! but...everyone can enjoy it! recommended!
