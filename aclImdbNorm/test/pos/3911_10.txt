i loved this film!! i have been waiting for this film to come out so i could see it. i saw it opening night and loved it, some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but i thought it was great. the actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. paris hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. the set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made. the two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great. the killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. i can't wait until this film comes out to video so i can get it and see it over and over again. the over view of my review is go see this film if you like hororr films and you will not be sorry i loved this film. i give this film a 10 out of 10 it rocks!!!
