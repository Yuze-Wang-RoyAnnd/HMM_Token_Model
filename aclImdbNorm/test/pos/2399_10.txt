fred carpenter screened eddie monroe at boston college, and judging from the enthusiastic response, he has much to be pleased about. a taught, well done indy, impressive for it's big budget look and feel. this movie has it all: a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending. this viewer didn't see it coming! excellent performances all around. craig morris and jessica tsunis were were especially well cast in the leads, delivering strong performances. and kudos to frank bongiorno and alex corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. it confirmed my belief that some of the best work in film will be coming from the independents, and fred carpenter looks to be one of the best.
