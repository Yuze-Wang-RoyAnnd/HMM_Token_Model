note: this should probably be read only after watching the film.<br /><br />it is very rare to find a documentary or movie that focuses on the loser. deep water does just this, making it one of the most thought provoking films in a very long time. it does not provide us with a hero to look up to, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look into ourselves.<br /><br />the film is about a group of men who attempt to sail around the globe, singlehandedly, and without stopping. only one makes it, several die, one decides not to return home, each of them on a psychological journey intriguing enough to merit entire films for themselves. yet the most interesting is donald crowhurst, or rather the way that he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as viewers.<br /><br />by any standards this man should be considered a despicable character, yet why is he depicted so heroically? why are we so sympathetic to him? from the beginning he made all of the wrong choices. he risked his family financially to get the boat, he left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all of the warnings despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie instead of admitting defeat, these choices snowball until the inevitable and final one: suicide. all for what? a place in history? a feeling of accomplishment? perhaps. what is important to consider is whether this mans situation was inevitable.<br /><br />each individual must ask himself if his natural human drive for fame and accomplishment would bring him to such recklessness, and i believe that examining your own reaction to crowhurst's story will offer at least some answer to that question.
