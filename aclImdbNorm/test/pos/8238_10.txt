a light, uplifting and engaging movie. watching irene dunne is a delight! as you watch her, she ceases to be irene dunne and becomes in every way paula wharton.<br /><br />i have enjoyed irene dunne in every movie that i have seen and that would be nearly all of them. what a shame that most of her movies need restoration so badly. i do hope irene dunne movie are restored before it is too late they are such treasures thank goodness this is not the case with over 21.<br /><br />it is a must see if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious overtones. i agree with a previous comment on the speech "the world and apple pie" it was one of the many highlights of the movie. i read somewhere that irene dunne helped in writing that speech along with director vidor (irene dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and it certainly seems to show through in her movies!
