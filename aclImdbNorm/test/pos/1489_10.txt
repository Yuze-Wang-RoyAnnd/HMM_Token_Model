mr. bean has always been my favorite. no matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. mr. bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. his gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. the situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. there is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous. its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are: 1) when mr. bean lodges at a hotel 2) the one where he watches the scary film 3) mind the baby ( the diaper scene especially). in fact, all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show. mr.bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny, including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes. the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing. 10 out of 10.
