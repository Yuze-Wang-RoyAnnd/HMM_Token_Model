while it may not be his most laugh-packed film, mighty like a moose stands as one of charley chase's most satisfying farce comedies, twenty minutes of clever sight gags, nicely choreographed physical comedy, and amusing quips (rendered via title card, of course) all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise. we're told up top that this is "a story of homely people-- a wife with a face that would stop a clock --and her husband with a face that would start it again." soon we meet buck-toothed charley moose and his wife vivien, who has an enormous nose. but there's no point in discussing plausibility when our plot hinges on such a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences: i.e., first, that charley would have his overbite corrected the very day his wife would have her nose fixed, second, that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries secret from the other, and third, that when bumping into each other in public afterward, charley and vivien wouldn't recognize each other. sounds like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it? multiple stretches is more like it. clearly, we're in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists, so as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility you're likely to enjoy this short.<br /><br />mighty like a moose gets off to a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are established, but things pick up once charley and vivien have "met" and made a date to attend a party together at the home of charley's dentist. they each rush home excitedly, enter separately and are at first unaware of each other's presence. (mr. & mrs. moose appear to be quite wealthy, incidentally, as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) there follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of buster keaton's the navigator in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up face-to-face. and once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower gale henry. henry, an estimable player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dancing. there's also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of charley, gale, vivien and vivien's dance partner, yet we're able to follow precisely what's happening between the principles by watching their feet.<br /><br />unfortunately for charley and vivien the party they're attending is raided, and from there on the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police dragnet and return home. when charley realizes that his newly-prettified wife was attempting to step out with another man he resolves to each her a lesson . . . while conveniently forgetting, of course, that he was attempting to do the very same thing. the last few minutes of this film offer some of chase's funniest physical comedy, capped with a good sight gag for the punchline. mighty like a moose leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated charley chase.
