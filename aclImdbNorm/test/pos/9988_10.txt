the focus of the key relationship in a young man's life, that of his relationship with his father, was excellently portrayed in this movie, "the greatest game ever played." the movie captured the essence of how important it is for a father to validate his son and let him know that he has what it takes to follow his dream.<br /><br />it didn't matter that economic and social class mores presented obstacles to be overcome by both father and son. it also didn't matter that others were acclaiming the son in exuberant celebration. what mattered the most was that he saw his father's hand and then his face of approval. the real life challenge for both father and son had been met.<br /><br />considering that in real life the hero of the story kept his amateur status and became a businessman pretty much verifies that all that went before the match was the training ground for a valid father and son relationship.
