this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and leonardo sbaraglia . of course vicente aranda is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i don't think this is one of his greatest movies even if it's fine. the screenplay plays with the introduction of merime'e as a character , it's a nice touch but it's unbelievable. the music is composed by jose nieto , national spanish prize in cinema. i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects .there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio dechent , maria botto and others . i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all.
