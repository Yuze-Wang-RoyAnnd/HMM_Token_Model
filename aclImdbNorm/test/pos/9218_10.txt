this was the very first movie i ever saw in the theatre by myself. i was 7 years old, and to this day it is one of my favorite movies. it's pure smarmy cheese. the cartoon was marketed towards young girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and big plastic heads, one for every colour of the rainbow, with their own special animals, 'sprites' and even a talking rainbow horse. typical of the time period, each show was about how hope, togetherness and magic can make 'everything all better'.<br /><br />the movie concerns the coming of spring, when all the light and colour returns to the world, but this time it just isn't happening for our lovely hero. a spoiled princess plots to overtake the soul lightgiver (and implied life giver)of the universe, which happens to be a giant diamond, for her own devious purposes, with no regard for reality, and now rainbow and her newly found friends orin, onyx and chris must save the universe. as i said before, it's cheesy, but it's cute, and it's exactly like all of the other cartoons from that time period, like the carebear movies, strawberry shortcake, rose petal and the smurfs. all movies created to sell dolls to kids. and it works. :)
