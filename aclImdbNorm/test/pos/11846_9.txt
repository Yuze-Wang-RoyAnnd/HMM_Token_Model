i loved this movie. it's a lot of laughs. the acting is good and the writing is really sharp. i'd rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves.<br /><br />it's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together. why do you have a ten line minimum? i'm not a critic, just a patron.<br /><br />i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. this movie should be seen on more screens than just one. i laughed from beginning to end. >
