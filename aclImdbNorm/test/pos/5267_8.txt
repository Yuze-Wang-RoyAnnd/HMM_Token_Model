vidor shines as judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. her brother, david, is so downtrodden by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes, rather than asking dad to do it for him.<br /><br />other reviewers have already outlined the plot, so i won't rehash it; i will, however, point out that nan, who is pregnant by david, is also married to him. this is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrific by 1921 standards. the two are secretly married, but nan's father, having been paid by david's father, tears up their marriage certificate.<br /><br />nan's death scene, with judith in attendance, is a truly heart-rending experience, and highly charged with emotion. this scene alone is worth watching the movie for, but there's far more to the plot than that; why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story?
