you don't have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this film. i watched it for the first time when i was nine, having been a fan of the t.v show, and my parents laughed just as hard as i did. it is done in the classic style of bugs bunny cartoons from yesterday, and considering todays vulgar cartoons, i would think anybody would appreciate a cartoon movie that relies more on "wackiness" then on vulgarity, to get a few laughs.
