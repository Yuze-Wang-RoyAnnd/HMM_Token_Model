while "the jackal" [remake of the excellent "day of the jackal"] has better esthetics [and a boatload budget], this film nails the actual persona of "carlos" down...<br /><br />quinn excels as the naval officer enlisted to impersonate the wiley jackal to draw him out of hiding and, at the hands of kingsley and sutherland, turns himself inside out to do so. risking his family, his career and all that he believes in, he takes on the task, albeit utterly unwillingly.<br /><br />to say more would spoil it... this is an excellent film.<br /><br />3 1/2 niro~stars [of 4]
