alright, so maybe the impersonations of jay leno and david letterman are not spot on, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. bob balaban and treat williams are excellant as warren littlefield and micheal ovitz.<br /><br />the movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny. kathy bates in particular is amazing as leno's manager.<br /><br />funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, this is a good tv movie.
