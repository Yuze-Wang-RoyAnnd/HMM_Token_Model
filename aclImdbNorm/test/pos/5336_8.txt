although it isn't half as hilarious as "chicken run," the new wallace and gromit comedy "the curse of the were-rabbit" (*** out of ****) yields more laughs than most live action comedies. british director nick park, who created the wallace and gromit characters, and co-director steve box rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion method of animation--known best as claymation--to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side-splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight. amusing as its whimsical storyline is, the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called plasticine. basically, every shot that you see in "the curse of the were-rabbit" required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment. hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. aardman studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day. for the record, "the curse of the were-rabbit" took five years to make. the lumpy looking characters, with thumb-prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and over-biting mouths. interestingly, gromit emerges as the funniest character, a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters.<br /><br />wallace and gromit are respectively master and pooch. as the human half of the duo, wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things. one of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes, hatches, and spring-operated contraptions that dress and feed them. meanwhile, gromit is the animal half. the running joke is that gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master. as good as his ideas and inventions are, wallace could not succeed without the loyal gromit giving him a hand. our heroes run a pest protection business called 'anti-pesto.' essentially, they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a bun-van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container. no, wallace and gromit don't kill the critters. instead, they keep them as pets, and wallace experiments with an invention
