i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey 'tarzan' concept made so popular by hollywood, weismuller, et al.<br /><br />yes; there is a lot of silly stuff. but then, the idea is silly. it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. i am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but that the concept has never been tried. and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood.<br /><br />still, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play. there are plenty of other excellent performances too. not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holm.<br /><br />what is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans. we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb, helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. and it demonstrates well how the phony 'civilisation' and 'morality' with which we cloak and justify our conduct, is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. it may seem a little overstated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see isn't just a truth about the victorians; its a truth about the way we are today. it's one that needs to be stated, and cannot be stated often enough. holm's character's obsession with the 'ray-zor' as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point. primitive bearded readers take note.<br /><br />the story is depressing. ultimately it's a tragedy. because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human 'civilisation'; we know he's doomed. before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess.<br /><br />in the end, it's a tale about ourselves. the path to extinction that other simians tread, must eventually be followed by humans.<br /><br />highly recommended for its ethical take, despite the hokey moments.
