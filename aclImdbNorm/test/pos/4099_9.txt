really, this movie should be released to dvd. i just got a bootleg copy of what i think was a studio film and i was utterly pleased!!! it was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. three of my people, michael york, olivia hussey. both having been in romeo & juliet, and also john gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone i thought that for the small amount i was spending it would be fine. boy was i right. i'm not going to give any of this one away, you may already know the story anyway, but i'll just say if you can get yourself a copy in any format...do it!@ you won't be sorry. jpc
