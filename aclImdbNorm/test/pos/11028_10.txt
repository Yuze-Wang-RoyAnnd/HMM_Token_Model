another "must have" film. henry brandon is a favorite! i was so surprised when i learned years ago that he was from germany because he sounds & looks so typically american! and wasn't he great in "the searchers" as chief scar??!! another of my favorites, i have it & watch it over & again. now if i could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! this is a great wildlife story & film for all ages. the scenery is so absolutely beautiful & the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children. if i could i would give a copy to all of my grands & great grands!
