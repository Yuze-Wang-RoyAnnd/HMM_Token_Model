i have just watched this movie for the first time today, and just loved it...<br /><br />yes it is simple in it's storyline, the sweetest love story,and how any female could not fall in love with callum blue beats me...<br /><br />the scenery in italy was as you would expect, beautiful, the baddies lost in the end,and for the two lovebirds to be reunited at the end, was wonderful, but that scene where a certain italian was sweeping away the confetti after eric and wanda's wedding, perfection!.<br /><br />have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better have a tissue ready and be enthralled, i know i was and hope to get it on dvd real soon. all the actors played their parts perfectly, this was a ww2 film you could believe in as it was so realistic, and without going over the top as in other films...
