i enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because i am sure there are subtleties that i missed. wonderfully cast, no over acting or clich'e performance or plot. uses a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be. at first i thought there were "observers" and "the observed", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. i recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
