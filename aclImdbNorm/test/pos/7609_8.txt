i saw this movie for a first time years ago, when it was still new and i was satisfied. it's a great hollywood make-belief story for teenagers. however, it's not lifelike. as much as you would want to believe it, these stories never happen. that's why it is irritating to watch movies like that. they play with teenagers' minds, just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed. i wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. the director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors. yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea isn't worth a 10. there are a lot of films about teenagers. so why don't we make a better one?
