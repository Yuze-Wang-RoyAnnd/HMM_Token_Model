i saw the merchant of venice in london last week. great acting by al pacino, jeremy irons, joseph finnes and lynn collins. compare to other movies based on shakespeare's play, this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow. bravo to michael radford for directing such top actors. the costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in venice it gives the film and authentic flavor. i had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters' anti-semitic behavior toward the jews and the cruelty of the christians. i do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case i am sure that it will get few oscar nominations.
