no matter how many times wile ethelbert "famishius famishius" coyote tries to get road "burnius roadibus" runner, we always know what's going to happen, though our sympathy always remains with wec. the highlight in "hook, line and stinker" is a rube goldberg-style scheme that wec hopes will finally finish off rr; but of course you know what happens.<br /><br />so, wile e. continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism (defined by george santayana as redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim) while road runner pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he could find himself. a real classic.<br /><br />and yes, the coyote's middle name is ethelbert. i learned that from "jeopardy!".
