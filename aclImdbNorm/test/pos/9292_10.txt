this is exactly what australian television and australian politics needs, people with a sense of humour!!! good on abc for supporting these guys. the show is based around a couple of aussie blokes who know how to take the mickey out of politicians or other people in the limelight. the boys use sydney as their main base for making a splash in the public. keep an eye out for the crazy wharehouse guy or mr ten questions. the guys who perform these acts are the same guys that presented cnnn. if you enjoyed cnnnn and the glasshouse then you will love this show. i am still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting because there are some questionable actions made by the guys...
