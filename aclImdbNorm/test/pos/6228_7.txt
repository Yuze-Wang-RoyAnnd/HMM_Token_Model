a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other's jeep mysteriously won't start). one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him. when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice mr. slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down, hermit-like house, which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack; he warns them about "davy", his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there. of course, one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again. is it slaussen? is it davy? the mannequins?? tourist trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting the better of people and never working out!), but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending. i started to feel sorry for slaussen (chuck conners is a terrific, creepy, over-the-top performance)at a point in the film, and you almost see the character of molly doing the same. this is a gem if you can find it; i had taped it off of cable when i was younger, and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced, but well worth it. fans of tanya roberts won't be disappointed either. best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers!!)<br /><br />i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain.
