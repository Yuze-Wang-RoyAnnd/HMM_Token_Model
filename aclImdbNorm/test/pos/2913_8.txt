...as valuable as king tut's tomb! (ok, maybe not that valuable, but worth hunting down if you can). i notice no one has commented on this movie for some years, and i hope a fresh post will spark some new comments. this is a film that i remembered only snippets of from childhood, and only saw recently when i tired of waiting for fox to honour its own past, and hunted down the korean dvd (in english, but with unremovable korean subtitles). i won't go through another long plot description - suffice to say that seeing it for the first time in its proper widescreen format left me agape at the vistas and the scope of the film. the matte paintings still hold up, and the palace sets are truly breathtaking. but it is the smaller scale details that lend this film its depth and richness, offering a glimpse into the lifestyles of egypt's poor as well as its elite. the bazaars, hovels, docks, embalming houses, and taverns are as fascinating as pharaoh's throne room. while errors abound on the large scale (most notably the dynastic succession), the details are more meticulously researched than the vast majority of hollywood's films. visually, it's not without its flaws - the interiors are often too overly lit and colourful to blend seamlessly with the exteriors. nevertheless, this is a movie that should be credited for being as audacious in the small as it is in the large. tedious? in parts, absolutely. overacted? underacted? yes, both - though 'understated' might be a more apt description. too long? absolutely not. i wished they had spent more time with sinuhe's experiences in the house of death, and among the hittites, and less with his 'romance' with nefer, though. historically inaccurate? yes, that too, but so was shakespeare. nobody chastises him for it. i appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next guy, but ultimately it has to be remembered that cinema is theater, not a history lesson.
