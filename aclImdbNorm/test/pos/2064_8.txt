a small-town schoolteacher (geena davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin! soon, there are men after her and a small-time private detective (samuel l. jackson).<br /><br />this was action-packed, with some great special effects and really funny one-liners (especially from jackson). although the action may get a little silly at times, who cares? after all, aren't movies meant to be a good time?<br /><br />craig bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. the movie itself was an all-around good time. just don't expect to have to think too much about it because then, if you take it too seriously, then the movie actually won't be fun but stupid instead.<br /><br />this movie doesn't deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.
