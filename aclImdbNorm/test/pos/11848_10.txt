i paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions capability of the main actress, julianne nicholson. i don't have words to describe how much have i been enchanted. all the actors and actresses played well. especially i noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in foreseeing the future - andy richter who played carl. i think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions, and the several consulting meetings, is like the real world. jay mohr who played ed, the future husband, also played very real behavior. but, i want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions repertoire which julianne nicholson is capable of and does so naturally, was overwhelming for me. indeed, the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people. i've seen this movie several times and have not been bored. it raises again and again in my thoughts.
