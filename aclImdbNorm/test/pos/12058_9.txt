certainly not a great show, but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment. it reminds of shows like married with children and roseanne as they go to places not traditionally dealt with in sitcoms. it's sometimes funny even if you ignore the laugh tracks, but not rip-roaring hilarious.<br /><br />some of the characters are pretty funny (the gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. this is also one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy (sorry for the butchered spelling) actually is effective and funny.<br /><br />is this an all in the family or seinfeld type show? absolutely not. however, it is certainly better than a show like 'til deat (probably the worst tv show of any type out at the moment).<br /><br />oh and the mom is not too bad looking and the hilary character is a little hottie.
