for those who are like me and are used to watch and enjoy high budget hollywood films, on huge screens with a surround audio, this film seems to be so distant. however it surprised me how close can it be to any human while i watch it. it is so natural that you feel like nobody wrote a scenario or nobody directed it. you are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it. for me, the time i spend on watching a film is the only time which i go to another world. this film is the first sample for me which shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films, surround audio capabilities to go to another world. this films sends you to another world (or maybe makes you return back to yourself) without millions of dollars of budget, or technical capabilities. i felt like that i'm reading l'etranger from camus.
