this game is one of the best horror/shooter games i've ever played. the plot is a little choppy, but the game never fails to send you plenty of chills and excitement. many people shelved the game when they found that there are no cheat codes for it and very little health potions and ammo to be found. but actually, after you've gone through the game once, you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms, so you can easily get by the second time around. the puzzles are great, not too hard, not too easy. there are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. and there are plenty of gaming areas. you really feel like you're in a good stephen king novel as you play. it's nice and creepy. pick this game up cheap and have some fun.
