people seem to be expecting citizen kane here! the planet is a b-monster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed. the director clearly has something to offer - not so sure about some of the cast. as for the effects? lb8000 ain't a lot of effects budget.i for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci-fi head or anyone who doesn't take monster movies too seriously. if so? watch 3colours blue instead.i noticed one review saying it had ripped off alien. like alien didn't rip things off. the best thing about the film? the director. the worst thing about the film? the cast. maybe it's time for the director to move from glasgow to london and find some talent. in the meantime - well done. at least you're trying to do something.
