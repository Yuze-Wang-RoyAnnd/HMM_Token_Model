i gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with ingrid bergman:) lol. i really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful (even when they are awful) because she is in them. if it hadn't been her and vivien leigh (as it had originally been desired i hear) i would have given it a 9.0 simply because i love viv but probably not as much as i love ingrid. and any other actress would have made it maybe a 6. it's a good story, two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad. reminds me a little of gwtw except laced with a more highbrow attitude. gary cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film, but hey ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be.
