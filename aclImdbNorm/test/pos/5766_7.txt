while possibly the stupidest, most tasteless, and violent slapstick comedy ever made, guest house is also a very funny one. don't listen to the critics, they have no sense of humour. while the climax runs out of steam (but not vomit), it's still a funny party movie. seven candles in the eye out of ten.
