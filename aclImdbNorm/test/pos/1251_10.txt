it is so nice to see bruce willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor. he shines in this film as the near-40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child--until he meets him face to face. this is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the whole family. it is about caring for each other, keeping some of the child inside you, and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would. willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids (just witness "the sixth sense" with haley joel osment), and he has great chemistry with spencer breslin here. there is some nice photography and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting. a great film to see with every member of your family.
