spoilers ahead <br /><br />15 park avenue: my humble take on this film <br /><br />now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like 15 park avenue ought to be palatable to my sensibilities. with this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that i hadn't watched the complete film earlier, i watched this film last saturday. there are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary mulholland drive (david lynch) from which, this film borrows at least 3 concepts:- <br /><br />a) that (at least some) truths are relative b) the first scene of shabana and konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that betty and rita undertook in mulholland drive. in both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in aparna's film c) the incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per se is seamlessly linked to other works of lynch (notice carefully the disheveled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in 15 pa appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message <br /><br />the other films from which 15 pa also borrows is blow up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the end of antonioni's masterpiece). of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, "a beautiful mind". although, admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of konkona's character through those very prophecies. in an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of shabana, where quantum physics and the theory of relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of mithi but for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. so, mithi's pain at being rejected in love by joydeep is in harmony with the inability of shaban to form a special bond with either kunal(dhritiman) or sanjeev (kanwaljeet). but i'm getting ahead of myself. viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- <br /><br />hypothesis 1: "it was shabana all along" there is a certain section of the audience who think so. but that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing mithi along with her) <br /><br />hypothesis 2: "there was a real mithi and the ending is a metaphor" this pov says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by joy (rahul bose), that mithi is looking for something that she will never find, his wife laxmi (shefali shah) philosophizes that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the end of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment <br /><br />there are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by our knowledgeable audience like:- <br /><br />hypothesis 3:" shabana and konkona are alter egos of the same person" hypothesis 4: "shabana too is a figment of mithi's imagination" hypothesis 5: "the old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story" <br /><br />are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? well, your guess is as good as mine <br /><br />"why 15 park avenue?" contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the park avenue in ny, i believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. remember, her stating jo jo's profession as "prime minister of shikakai", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing shampoos. the prefix '15' is used as it was on 15th december that mithi got engaged to joydeep and after his walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. the film has its fair share of flaws- lack of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialogs unabated by some forced dialog delivery. inconsistent performances (shabana and dhritimaan are excellent though imo) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. shefali chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. i give it 7/10 as it made me think but not any higher than that because i can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, i have already thought on similar lines earlier. so, the experience post 15 pa is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. where am i coming from? i gave 9.5/10 to '36 chowringhee lane' (though rumors still persist that one satyajit ray ghost directed it), 7.5 to 'paromiter ek din', 7 to 'mr and mrs iyer' and 5 to 'paroma'. on an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as say a 'truman show'
