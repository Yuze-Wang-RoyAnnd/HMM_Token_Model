i'm new to gaming, but i would have started much sooner if this film had been around! i caught it at gen con last year (a trip made only as a favor to my husband) and loved it! even to a non-gamer like i was at the time, it's funny and accessible--so much so that i finally relented and started sitting in on my husband's gaming group.<br /><br />i don't want to give away any plot details, but if you're a gamer, you need to see this film--and if you're not, you're going to have a great time despite yourself. there are certainly "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyone.<br /><br />my only complaints: wish it were longer and wish it were available on dvd. soon, perhaps?...
