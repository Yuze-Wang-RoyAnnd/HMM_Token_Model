i watched this mini in the early eighties. sam waterson proved himself to be a great actor. in fact when he began law and order i was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role. unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills. i wish i could find a copy of this rare series and review it. it is both factual and entertaining. everyone should see it to know what really happened. i was so moved i purchased and read the book "pppenheimer-shatterer of worlds". and saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight. if you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance mr. waterston can really provide an audience. enjoy the movies!
