i don't know what the last reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment. basically 2 dudes are put in competitions at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. they mix up the scenarios for each show so it is not the same every time. the panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize game. they will break down what the guy did wrong, and what they guy did right. some contestants are weak, some are strong but what happens is always entertaining. if you are a guy that goes out, you can relate. i've seen weak game, i've seen strong game, and this show is for real. no doubt.
