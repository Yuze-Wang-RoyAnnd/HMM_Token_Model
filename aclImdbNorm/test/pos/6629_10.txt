being a huge fan of bergman i had to search literally years to find this movie (at a price less than $60 i mean) and finally bought it a few weeks ago. the basic premise of bergmans films are the relationships between the characters and how they deal with trying situations. this film therefore is the same yet it is different because the setting is far different than most of the bergman films the i have seen.<br /><br />it is set in wartime and the heros are caught in the middle.<br /><br />it is riveting from start to finish and it once again proves that liv ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century. a must see.
