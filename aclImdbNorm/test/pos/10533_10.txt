i had such high hopes for teletoon retro to air this but instead of having shows such as this, ones that don't get the treatment that they deserve, they air things that i may have seen dozens of times before.<br /><br />the centurions was the highlight of my pre-teen years. i know that may seem a little bit clich'ed but it's true. after duke from g.i. joe, jake rockewell is another one of those cartoon characters that i really had a crush on.<br /><br />it's too bad that teletoon retro doesn't see it the same way people of my generation do. otherwise teletoon retro would be a lot better than it is.
