a german freshman, stefan hitch hikes to paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the paris freak scene. he then follows her in the famous isle of ibiza, the hippie joint were meets wolf, a man who throws hitler-jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps estelle under his thumb with dope. the couple tries to escape wolf, stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for estelle, who's groovy and a free spirit. great photography and music, plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie, cold and dramatic. the moral is quite strong (he was looking for the sun...) but i would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts enphasy on drug use.
