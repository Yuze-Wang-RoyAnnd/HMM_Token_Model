apart from the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 germans in one scene at any one time, plus the same 2 half tracks, this film is absolute top class. everything is accurate. that is the point, i think, from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionment.everyone is as grey as the field grey uniforms. grey men with the life drained out of them. forget us made gung ho rubbish like blackhawk down and private ryan. this is one of the best war films ever. only cross of iron beats this for tension and story. please could we have a proper un-dubbed german language with english subtitles version in the uk ? without having to pay ridiculous import charges from europe. most other dvd's are multilingual. why not this one ?
