i don't understand why everyone is hating on barney. if you hate the show so much, then don't watch it! its stupid how everyone is changing the "i love you" son to "i hate you." if you don't like it, fine. whatever, thats your opinion. but there is no point to degrading the show, when it isn't even that bad. ok, so its corny, and yes, it has its flaws, but its a kids show. kids don't want to be sad and miserable, they want to be happy. and barney helps that. and even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger and etc. and yes, barney uses magic. but the kids see barney as a figment of imagination. kids need a place to escape to express themselves. the world is a miserable and hard place. we all need a place to express ourselves, and be happier. barney does this to us. this show is great. i watched barney when i was younger. yes, some people find it stupid. but i watched it, and i'm top of my class. it might not necessarily make you smarter, but that's not the point. i believe that the point of barney is to provide a place where kids can be kids and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. where imagination lives on. so many teenagers now are unimaginative and are scared to express themselves. barney helps encourage that. barney helped me to not be afraid and to just show myself for who i am. i'm a sophomore at high school now, an ap student with a 4.0, a drama student with a love for theater and art, and with a new baby cousin who loves barney. i watch it with him and enjoy it and sing along with it. yes, its corny and silly, and whatever, but its great for kids. who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time to have fun? im a kid at heart and i love barney. its great for kids and those who are a kid at heart.<br /><br />its a great show for babies and toddlers. so stop hating. say that you don't like it, but stop it with the "dumbest show ever" or "barneys a load of bull" or whatever. keep it to yourself. take a chill pill or whatever. here's something: i never liked sesame street. but you don't see me going: "grover is a load of bull" or "cookie monster should die" or whatever. i hate all of the bullss**t that people say about books or movies, like barney or twilight. if you hate it, ok, whatever. no one cares. don't go saying hate things about it, cuz you might just offend someone.
