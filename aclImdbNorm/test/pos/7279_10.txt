wow, i loved this movie, this film was filled with plot twists, good acting, great story, and a surprising ending. to be completely honest this movie wasn't overly gory, it does contain some gore, though, but was more on the psychological side. i read it on the internet: the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days. amazing!!! this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making. what starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted, even a bit more sinister. not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations
