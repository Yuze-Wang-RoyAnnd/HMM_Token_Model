purportedly made back to back with 'erotic nights of the living dead' with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have laura gemser. much derided by all i rather like this movie. sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop, but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and i actually like the hardcore. i find it at once naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn't just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises! i find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable, even if two are set upon a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around. the creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is, it has to be said, a disappointment. still, in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first (or afterwards in at least one case!) and this film is not as slow as some maintain. moreover there are some fine moments of sexploitation, not least the lady scientist and her urge for two 'natives', and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat, gaze back at the island they have escaped from, and find there is still time for one last act of copulation.
