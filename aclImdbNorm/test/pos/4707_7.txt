i would give this movie a good strong 7. while it definantly isn't the greatest movie, or even one the best movies of it's kind (the killing fields is better) it does at least attempt to tell a necessary story.<br /><br />i think the method of introducing laura into burma was a bit contrived. first of all, burma isn't exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 80's. secondly, if you did make it burma, your passport would not get lost. a sane person would make darn sure they knew where their passport was at all times. with that in mind, i'm sure the screenwriter knew that was weak, but needed something. patricia arquette's performance was understated, and i just didn't buy that she was a doctor. however, at least she didn't overact the role, which often happens in movies like this. u aung ko was good, but also understated. the end is hard to follow, since most of the dialogue is in burmese, with people translating for laura. it would have been difficult for laura, and is difficult for the viewer as well. another plus is the strong se asian scenery in the film, which was enjoyable to see.
