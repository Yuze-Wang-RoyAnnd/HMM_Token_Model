it is a risky business to film such a lavish production of "the merchant of venice". it could be a stodgy, wooden, period piece, or it could be laughable for its excesses. this version is neither. while i am not completely sold by al pancino's very restrained shylock, he does give a competent and honorable performance. jeremy iron's antonio, is as always with his tortured-self roles, riveting. some of the lesser roles seemed to be a little to much in the spirit of boisterous fun, "a boy's own venician adventure story", but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically moved forward through the film.<br /><br />it goes without saying, that the location shots, costumes, and interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction.<br /><br />one thing, on which i do not wish to comment on, is the anti-semetic content of the play. the film is as sympathetic to the predicament of the jews as possible while still portraying shylock as the instrument of his own self-destruction. it is a sad comment that four centuries later, the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere screening at the toronto film fest.<br /><br />this is a beautiful film, and i look forward to several viewings.
