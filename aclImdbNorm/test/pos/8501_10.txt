denis leary can indeed be funny and clever at times and is always likable, but this takes the cake! this show showed leary's genius.<br /><br />the job is set in new york. leary plays mike mcneil, a hard-nosed detective who is married, has a occasional drug problem, and has a girlfriend. mcneil has serious attitude. so much he's dripping in it. the precinct is filled with funny, interesting and likable characters besides mcneil. an excellent cast too. all of the episodes in this show are really funny and are addictive. the one liners in this show are everywhere. you'll be in stitches after hearing them and still laugh about them a few minutes after and then some. the cases the precinct deals with are something else to stripper nuns, a bathroom hostage situation, and more are over the top. this show was too good. could have grown legs to last many more seasons. <br /><br />the last word: a great, fantastic show. i miss this show dearly. all episodes of this show are great. you get even belly-laughs...a lot. abc made a huge mistake by giving this the ax. too bad leary did not revive the show for cable tv. still, i give this show one of my highest of recommendations. truly a one of a kind show.
