i am surprised people, after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0's, i thought more people would get a kick out of "throw momma from the train". this was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors, billy crystal and danny devito. together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. billy is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead, danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. when billy gives some "misunderstood" advice to danny, danny offers a proposition to billy, if he kills his ex wife, billy has to kill his mother. this is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! it's a good one!<br /><br />7/10
