i don't know how i would feel if i lived in usa. i would watch some preview scenes, advertisements, i would know, sidney pollack directed it, harrison ford and kristin scott thomas starring in. i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review. would i be disappointment?<br /><br />i read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was: this is boring, long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting. harrison is wooden, cold. the sublots should be cut. too serious, particularly for harrison ford. i am interested in the subject, and i like harrison ford in the films which are not actions. i like sidney pollack and kristin scott thomas too. so reading the reviews on imdb website then in other sites then in february in the hungarian movie magazines i was wonder and wonder what the film was. anyway there are films, directors, stars what/who i want to see despite any reviews.<br /><br />i can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion, but i feel different. it is true i liked sliding doors, the forbidden woman (this is a french film, i don't know what its title in english, or in french). basic of these films is development of a love.<br /><br />i think random heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way.<br /><br />it may be true that the sublots -the congress election and the cop's investigation after a corrupt policeman- are not written well, are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character.after his wife's death and betrayal emotion, angry of dutch comes to the surface during his work. he will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend (then the woman too). the film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: our wife/husband's death and cheating. one of them is the woman's: this is tragedy, but the life is continuing. she doesn't want to mourn forever. what she wants to know-what her husband's lover-the cop's wife- thought about her she will not learn never. she is forced to behave in this way. the elections are comes, and anything about his husband may become scandal. she wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father. the man is a cop.he suffering from the fact he lived in lies. he wants to know -maybe every men would want to know in this situation-when his wife started to cheat him. how long had she got lover?. he needs the woman's help but she doesn't want, but the guy is stubborn and steady/persistent. the woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget. their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (i said it in spite of that they made love in bed) however the cop, can't stop with investigation, can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the "love", and the woman wants their relationship to continue. but it can't. the woman realizes it. the end is a bit sad, but logic, and nice at the same time.<br /><br />it was pleasant for me to see again peter coyote-i like this man's face- sidney pollack. i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was good.<br /><br />i think harrison ford did an okay job. his eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament. it was pity he had not got any joke. but ford has got a good sense of humour. a reviewer noticed (in hungary): "ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice. but dr jones is not smiling at us".. but he smiles at the end and it is soooo good. with the rest i agree. i very like him in this role- he is good in acting of this a bit rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop.. the character of kristin scott thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident, but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions. but she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop.the two cool, reserved- people find each other.<br /><br />maybe the script is not good. it is full of common, banal sentence, but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man. it is a good film but not for everybody, not for the general big audience. i watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better. about the latter, maybe sidney pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn't go to multiplex. anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes, who like only ford's action films miss this movie.
