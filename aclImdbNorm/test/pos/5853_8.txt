i find it hard to believe this could happen at all. we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past. the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. so the first crime they commit is murder? just to play and jostle with the cops? how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it? also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle. hmmm. this whole concept is really hard to believe. that said let's move on. i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then. as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive. the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess. sandra does a superb acting job. she sure made me believe she was one angry cop. as for solving the crime, i thought it was great. this movie kept me planted in my chair. loved the acting of all but sam. he had no get-up and go. the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene.
