film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. only living. staying alive in a cruel world. a nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. they, the children of the movie, are desensitized. they are more than desensitized by what is around them. they see sex as an act, like they are watching a tv program. when the one boy is with the hooker, pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare, no feeling. he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away. a "human" film, with "human" relations and moral judgement in a ugly, scared, cruel world. reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.
