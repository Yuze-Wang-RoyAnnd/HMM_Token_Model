i read the comments about this movie before watching it and wasn't expecting much, but as a b movie it's a curiosity. i guess you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy this kind of thing, but i seriously thought it was awesome. people should watch it just for the experience because it's totally one of a kind. don't expect much of it. the acting is poor, transitions were obviously done on a pc, etc. definitely a b movie, but nonetheless really worth checking out. very funny. mild gore, and some questionable themes, so probably not something to show your gran, but for the more adventurous viewer i'd say it's a must see.
