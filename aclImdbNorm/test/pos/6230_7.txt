"tourist trap" is among my favorite late 70's/early 80's horror flicks. a group of young people are heading somewhere, one pair in the car ahead, & that car has a flat, and our film opens with the young man, woody, pushing the tire along looking for a service station. he finds a seemingly abandoned place, and yet hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. along comes the rest of the young folks (in a vw thing) and they pick up woody's girlfriend, and find this very same place, slausen's oasis, or some such thing..and then mr. slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream. of course, the vw thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd mr. slausen (chuck connors) offers his help. mr. slausen has a museum, with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house, where he says davey lives. and who is davey? why, davey crockett, he says...but if it were davey crockett, they'd all probably be safer. the girls are left alone while slausen goes to help with fixing the car, but of course curiosity gets the better of one & she goes to investigate, and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named...davey. what follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one, they're taken prisoner by davey, who says he's slausen's brother. one girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated to a plaster facial, which results in her death when it covers up her air supply. at any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind (but weird) mr. slausen is not exactly what he appears to be. a good, creepy late 70's horror flick, and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
