when i first saw this show advertised to be on australian tv back in the late 90's i ignored it thinking it was just capitalizing on the kevin costner movie 'bodyguard'. but then i caught an episode and i wish i had watched it from the start. the partnership between sean pertwee and louise lombard was so well acted and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. it wasn't an overblown tv show that you can tell spent most of its energy in making things explode so that they could put that clip in the commercial to lure audiences and then not deliver on any other level. the show delved into the lives of the two main characters and thats what made it interesting. the stories for each episode where also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors. and of course there was a lot of action and intrigue which is always good. but what was great was that there was humour, and it flowed naturally from the characters, it didn't appear contrived. it was british but in a good way, and if this show was made in america it would no doubt be on dvd by now. i don't know why british tv production companies are not interested in releasing this show on dvd. it was a great show and deserves a dvd release.
