its very tough to portray a tagore novel along cinematographic lines.and if you forget an obscure production of 1967 then its the first time that chokher bali has been done on a grand scale. overall the sets looked fantastic with the right touches for making a successful period drama.prasenjit,so used to doing crass commercial stuff made a good effort.i saw the bengali version and found that aishwariya's voice was dubbed,which made her dialog delivery a bit poor. while the director did a good job portraying each of the characters with finesse,yet there was very little in the way of meaningful plot,probably a lack of the story itself.however the development of the characters including those with minor roles seem to be the strongest point.its tough to make some tagore stories into films,as only the visual parts seem to get realized.
