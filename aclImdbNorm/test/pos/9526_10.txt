i think together all the reviewers have captured this film really well. i have seen it many, many times, but i still feel a sense of joy and warmth just as i did the first time. my emotional response to this film never seems to fade. the final scene certainly brings me to tears, but so does the scene between perks and the children on his birthday. and as for the kindly gentleman. something else is going on with that character. the generous provider and solver of problems. he knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. a perfect father to run to and make us feel safe. i do not know how the film does it, but it touches something very english deep inside, which has long gone from our daily experience, but yet we all instantly recognise and yearn for again.
