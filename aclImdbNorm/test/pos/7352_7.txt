okay, "pretty good" doesn't scream rent me but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed campfire tales. while by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is. the scares don't just jump out at you but instead the directors build steadily to the climatic moments. the film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories. the writers have updated the tales rather well and twisted them just enough that the familiar endings still pack a punch. the best of the shorts are "the honeymoon" and "people can lick too", i enjoyed both as they have nice suspense throughout each story. "the locket" was a good ghost story and the wrap around "the campfire" is pretty good too except they go for one too many twists at the end. the only disappointing segment is "the hook" which is fine because it's pretty short anyway. overall i give this a 7 out of 10. it has suspense, which is lacking from most horror movies today, and good acting by the cast. it may not rate up there with halloween and the exorcist but it's a good little movie well worth the price of a rental.
