<br /><br />very good 1970s movie about mob operations in new jersey. when a "maverick" gangster doesn't play by the rules of the neighborhood, sooner or later, it's time for elimination.<br /><br />joe pesci was true to his character -- smooth and funny. he only gets better with age. his face and present day fame should not have been used on the dvd cover to sell this "b" grade movie as he was only the third billed star.<br /><br />dated 1970's printed wide lapel shirts and lesser quality background music make for a distraction. nice to see the 1970's big cars. <br /><br />however, the acting is good. <br /><br />nakedness on the part of anne johns was not needed to make this mob story work. and, she does not show up in the database as every acting again in any film other than this one. too bad; she did a good job!<br /><br />moral of the story: don't get your "don" upset with you.<br /><br />if you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then check out this dvd. it was part of a three-movie-on-one dvd $5.88 special at the local discount store.<br /><br />
