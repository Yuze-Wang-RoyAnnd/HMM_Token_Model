great acting is best rewarded by pairing with a melodramatic script which truly elevates the human spirit. to all those minions who toil each and every day, take heart! your patience is virtuous. your forbearance and decency will evidence, in ways you will never anticipate. this is your great story. i do not believe you can watch through to the end without a wisp of moisture in that hardened eye. or, can you? for me, it would not be so... the story is relentless! the idealist, denied his due. will anyone speak up? ah! but you will need to see the show yourselves! observe the schoolmaster in his prime, without the notice and peerage the observer would certainly expect. and why does he continue so? yes! you must watch o'toole's performance for yourselves! i can only wish it were still 'in print' to purchase, then present to my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives.
