"side show" is one of the weirdest horror movies ever made from full moon pictures. very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the trailer makes it out to be (the trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). also, the acting and visual effects are well done. i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, slumber party massacre, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.
