i think it's the sort of film you either love or hate and i'm really not the type to go in for arty movies. my mother rented "mullhuland dr" the other night and i nearly ran from the room, ha. but i love this film.<br /><br />we recorded "the beat" one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident. saved that tape and watched it a lot. i eventually got the vhs to add to my collection. i've watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems. i even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. she refused to let me do it. if it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good :) honest she never treated me the same after that.<br /><br />i liked the acting it came off very true and honest. it wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that. it was true to life, how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how hollywood does. it was great acting especially by the one playing rex.<br /><br />the story was original. not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too. not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. simply caring and friendship make things a bit better.<br /><br />the only thing is that even in the 80's there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt this film.<br /><br />i think it's a must see. you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later.
