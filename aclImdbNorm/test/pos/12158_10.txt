has there ever been an angel of death like mimsy farmer in barbet schroeder's 1960s heroin opus? sort of jean seberg with a hypodermic. pink floyd score. despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses, a classic, shamelessly ripped off by erich segal/noel black for their inept jennifer on my mind (1971), although tippy walker, playing a similar character, is herself very junkie-appealing in the latter mess. more, though, is terrific, a great 60s drug movie and, simply, an important document of its time. very much a cult film so join the cult.<br /><br />no american movie then, as far as i can remember, charts the same territory. mimsy's an astonishing archetype, elevating this into mythic realms. not for the faint-hearted. great sex scenes too.
