the viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly missing the point here. this is a superb movie, excellent and realistic portrayals of a middle class jewish family in brighton beach, brooklyn, of long ago. the nuances are perfect and i felt the casting of everyone was superior. i especially found the acting done by judith ivey just perfection---especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night. that scene was oscar worthy. but, really, all the acting was fine. i recommend this movie. it is a fun, family film and delightful to see how a lovely middle class family lived in brooklyn so long ago. see it and you will be glad you did. has some very funny lines and the eugene character is a real comedian--very funny.
