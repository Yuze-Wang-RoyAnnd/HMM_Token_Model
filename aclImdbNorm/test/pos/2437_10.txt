it was a sweet, intro for the most intelegent sailor soldier, sailor mercury. it consisted with a new "in croud", merciurios. he, at the beganing wrote a love letter to ami, which would be starltling (of course) and, now, ami thiks he is a chibi-einstien, and he is attractive (he ended up looking like umino (melvin)). this was a halarios (expesialy minako's "it's no skin off my neck" scene (hot!)) well, i really like the bishojo senshi sailor moon series, i personally think its the best anime ever!, but, this movie was nice, funny, but not as adventurios as sailor moon r- it was more like the "s" movie. i saw this @ sailor moon univewrse, with real player, and it was pretty good. (over all)
