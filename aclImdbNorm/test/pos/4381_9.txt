it started off weird, the middle was weird, and the ending was weird, but i really, really liked it. a modern day version of homer's odyessy but that is really irrelevant. interesting story and casting. clooney was great and i applaud him for taking on such an adverterous role - so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again. lots of surprise stars - why isn't holly hunter in more. do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick.
