this show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! when i first tuned in to america's next top model, i expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. i didn't. this show is actually serious fun. i read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be america's next top model. and it so does! who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? on antm you get to see what it's really like. and who doesn't love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights? or enjoy wanting to throw something at that janice lady?<br /><br />give this a chance. don't expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson. just enjoy it for what it is. serious fun!
