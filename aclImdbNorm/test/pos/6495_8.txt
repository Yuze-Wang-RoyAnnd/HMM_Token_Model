what do you mean son of actor, not an actor. you don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar---it doesn't work that way, not in uk at any rate.<br /><br />macbeth (this version) is a low budget scottish movie. you can't compare this to the polanski version because polanski has all the budgets in the world. <br /><br />jason acted throughout school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of robin hood in britain's "robin of sherwood" television series. he has appeared in many films since then, including "shanghai noon" and "lord of the rings 2''. jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, unconditional entertainment. he recently wrapped filming on his latest movie, which stars cuba gooding, jr. and ray winstone. <br /><br />and all this has nothing to do with being the son of sean connery. if you think jason said to sean, "daddy, i wanna be in macbeth movie that they are going to film," and sean said, "sure, son, whatever you say," and made a phone call and got his son the role, you are mistaken. in fact, jason connery is being cut out of his father's will. seeing as how his father is sean connery, that's a big chunk of change jason will be losing out on. the reasoning behind the decision is apparently sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. the relationship has become fairly strained, with jason even threatening to change his name. <br /><br />------------------------------------ of being the son of sean connery,<br /><br />"i realize that i'm always going to be compared to my father. there are innuendos all the time. should i spend my whole life justifying myself?" ------------------------------------<br /><br />so stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of sean connery (big deal!).<br /><br />watch jason in bullet to beijing and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability.
