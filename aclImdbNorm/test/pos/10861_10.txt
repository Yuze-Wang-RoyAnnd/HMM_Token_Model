i'm glad i read the sarah waters novel first, since i had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time. the ones cast for this production, however, were not at all disappointing - in fact, after i got used to rachael stirling as nan, i think nina gold did a damn fine job in the casting department. (can keeley hawes be more delicious?!)<br /><br />the bbc has done it again: this is a wonderful production of a very good book, and they have done it up in style. if you can get your hands on this (vhs, dvd) be sure to get the 181-minute version (the uncensored one.) it is a marvelous journey, albeit a bit rocky at times, that you won't regret taking.
