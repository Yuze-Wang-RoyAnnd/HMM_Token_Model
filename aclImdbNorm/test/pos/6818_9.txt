this short has all the elements of a great movie. every time i show it to friends (on dvr) they love it too. the dialog is so, 'real'. the acting is superb. while the effects/props weren't as convincing by themselves, taken with everything else in the shot, they are expertly placed/used. the music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of 'moment' film. people who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to their core about what they see in this movie. most go 'that's it?', but in the end they blossom with new understanding, and leave the movie with one word to describe it:<br /><br />'beautiful'. the beauty of the film is also skin deep. i love the fact that there aren't any conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices that you do hear, are agreeing with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. and the ending made me love it more! harsh reality sometimes is more film worthy than any plot device, or twist. <br /><br />(wasn't joshua leonard the guy in blair witch project?) :) movie by a fictitious dead guy..great!
