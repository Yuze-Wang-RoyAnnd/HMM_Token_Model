a bus drops off a nameless man outside a run-down standard oil gas station in the middle of nowhere. we never learn where the bus came from, or why he is on it, or who he even is. why is he the only passenger? is he a prisoner? is he the "bothersome man" referred to in the title of the movie? has he died and gone to heaven, or hell? like our man, we don't get a chance to stop and wonder. he is met by a gatekeeper of sorts and shuttled off to a nondescript city. from day one, all the choices are made for him. an apartment has been rented, a job has been found, an office assigned. in fact, his life is not entirely unlike life in the virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban condos. women are heartless, dinner parties are a drag, office jobs suck. but some pieces don't fit the puzzle. silently efficient, gray-clad goons roam the streets. are they some sort of paramedics, or the secret police? and why are there no children? is the story even set in the real world? whenever we think we might be getting some answers, new mysteries unfold. "the bothersome man" leaves you half relieved that it's over, half wanting more. i hope they make it into a computer game soon.
