"the seven-ups" seems like a replay of "the french connection," which was released two years prior. both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances, as well as stunt driver bill hickman.<br /><br />but we aren't dealing with french drug baddies; instead, we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum. we get to see unpleasantness and a pre-1990s new york city.<br /><br />i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action, and it is a reminder of a cooler time. that said, when one compares the car chases, mr. hickman had involvement in the three most compared: this movie, bullitt and the french connection. each chase scene has its own qualities, and this one is simply superb.<br /><br />and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd.
