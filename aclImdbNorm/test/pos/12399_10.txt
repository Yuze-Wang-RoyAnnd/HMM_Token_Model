as a camera operator, i couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved. the performances were excellent, as was the story. just when i thought this film was about to slow down, it didn't. heart-pounding tension, great pacing through editing, and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction. the camera was always in the right place. love that.
