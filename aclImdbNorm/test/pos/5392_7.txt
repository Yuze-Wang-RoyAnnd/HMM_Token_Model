gary cooper and a marshal change identities, since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws. what is remarkable in this film are the costumes, both the marshal's and steve cochran's who is the bad guy. cochran wears his guns backwards, probably to be able to crossdraw. the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok. ruth roman, looking very pretty is the marshal's fiancee. there is plenty of action, never a dull moment, but you have to concentrate, because the story is a bit complicated. good entertainment.
