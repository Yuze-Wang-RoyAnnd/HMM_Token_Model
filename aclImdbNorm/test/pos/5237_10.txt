if one overlooks the technical problems of this early (1930) sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of john wayne, one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since. beginning at the missouri, a large caravan of conestoga wagons, people, and animals head west. the wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons. indians meet with wayne, and allow the train to pass through their land. later, indians gather west of the train to combat them. the wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle, and fire their rifles creating with the circling indians a veil of smoke.<br /><br />when the battle ends, the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart. this scene is remarkable, as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart. it is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living. the wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere. they finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in oregon. the film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2.0:1 ratio (in 1930!).<br /><br />i haven't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film. moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie. given the technical limitations of the sound, the music is at times moving, such as when wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's killers and at the end.<br /><br />while all the critics rave about the searchers and wayne's psychology, racism, short temper, and complex characters, the big trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships. one of the best westerns i have seen.
