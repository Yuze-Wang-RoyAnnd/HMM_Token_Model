this cartoon documents the second encounter between wile e. coyote and the roadrunner, and is definitely better than their first meeting in fast and furry-ous (1949).<br /><br />if measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not rank among the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952. regardless, this is a very funny short. coyote (carnivorous vulgaris) chases the roadrunner (accelerati incredibilus) along the road and gets completely tired out. the ingenious scientific "latin" names of the characters are very original, and has been mimicked before in other un-related cartoons. the coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of- i don't know -boredom. such jonesesque expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes. then he has an idea, and another laughable expression is worn. the slapstick jokes are all hilarious, and mask the fact that it is truly evil to inflict such pain on a poor, helpless, genius coyote. everyone knows, but who cares?<br /><br />the old rocket gag is present, too. coyote straps himself to a rocket, which should produce enough oomph for him to catch up with roadrunner and grab him. instead, the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: eat at joe's. this classical gag originates from this cartoon; though obvious, it still makes people laugh.<br /><br />the highlight truly is the chase through the mineshaft. the two wear helmet-lights, and we see the tunnel through which the two are going, with only the lights visible. here, the comedy reaches a peak. a must-see sequence, maybe even the best sequence in the early days of roadrunner. the final touch is provided by the writing of michael maltese, as coyote's light goes out and he unknowingly lights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and spell out the letters "yipe!" after the blast. such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes, and as soon as it starts the fun's all over. the rocket skates are another good idea, as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tight-rope (a sequence that appears in space jam [1996]). to give the results of those away would be useless. the free drink proves to be a problem for wile e. at the end of the second-last sequence: namely the rocket skates.<br /><br />this classical cartoon is littered with fine animation, except for the characters. though they are animated very well, the two characters are very primitive; which might be an understatement. though at first it may seem weird, the humor of the ensuing sequences makes one forget.<br /><br />if you like vintage jones, watch this. if you love roadrunner, get this on video. excellent entertainment (rating: 8/10).
