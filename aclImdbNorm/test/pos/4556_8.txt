a kinda remake of planes trains and automobiles in a lot of ways.i think,i think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both john candy and chris farley left us when they still had a lot of stuff to do.god bless them both,i think the plots of 2 movies are really similar,road trips of two different poles of characters,and a lot of unlucky consequences because of the chubbies, this movie can not be planes trains and automobiles but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of chris farley, the missing part in this movie is the touchy stuff if we compare it with candy&martin classic,but i think its better this way
