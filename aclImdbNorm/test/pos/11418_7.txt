having seen the original when i was 13 (and, yes, i was stupid enough to watch it while babysitting!), i was excited to see this remake.<br /><br />camilla bell did a great job as jill johnson. and the fact that a teen horror flick could be made in the year 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and gore, made it even that much stronger of a film. i had a great time trying not to chew my fingernails off!<br /><br />this film won't win anyone an oscar, but it is entertaining and worth the matin'ee price ticket i bought to see it. i think girls around the world should watch the original and the remake...and then determine to never babysit again. <br /><br />all i can say is, i'm glad i'm too old to babysit! there's just something about being in a dark creepy house with sleeping kids that makes this movie classic. no blood, no gore...just good psychological fun! winner!
