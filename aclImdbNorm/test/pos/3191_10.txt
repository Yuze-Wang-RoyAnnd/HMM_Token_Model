cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'the great pretender' at production stage. i was living in oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... it was me that showed these guys how to speak scottish and after all this time, i only realise now one was russell crowe !!! it has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as i left oz the following month after wrap up party. at that time russell crowe was not the demanded actor he is now and i had no idea it was him until i saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming..... amazing... truly delighted with myself now !!!
