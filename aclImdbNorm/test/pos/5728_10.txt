i myself am a physics student, and i have to say i think this is one of the best 'popular' introductions to string theory that's out there. the elegant universe manages to make the entire topic of string (although it's actually m) theory accessible to a wider audience.<br /><br />some 'popular science' programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end, throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation, and presenting the theory in a boring, stale style. this programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale.<br /><br />i suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: that's against the point. explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base, and the way it's explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining.<br /><br />whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that greene presents: extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life, are they? but, if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme, you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. and if you're studying physics, well, it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more!
