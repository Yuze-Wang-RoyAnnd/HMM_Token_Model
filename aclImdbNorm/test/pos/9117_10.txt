i was able to see a preview of this movie through ucla's pre-screening program, and let me tell you: this movie is unbelievably good!!!! i have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one. i had a decent respect for tenacious d before seeing the movie, and now i am mad about them. i will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again.<br /><br />if you were on the fence about seeing this movie, get off and go see it!! it is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days, as you will surely bust a nut laughing during the whole thing.<br /><br />aside from the comedy, the glorious and divine music that flows from kg's guitar and jb's voice is awe inspiring. the audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous (and hilarious) lyrics. if for nothing other than the music itself, this movie is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />with a wonderfully coherent storyline tying in almost all aspects of the traditional "d" history and hallmarks, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some pretty awesome cameos, this movie ranks up there with the best! go see it!!
