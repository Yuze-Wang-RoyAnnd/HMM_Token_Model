'the big snit' came into my life complete by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul. a scar of love, destruction and pointlessness that will forever be a part of my life. this is tale of beautiful futility. we are helpless without each other. we are helpless against governmental wrong-doings. we are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love. deaf to the mutterings and goings on of an world outside the window. blind to an inevitable apocalypse. dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over-indulgent society. this is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war. their petty bickering is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it's pains and darkness everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way. we travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a some of their simple,loving, honest philosophy in tow. i am so very glad that i exist in this 'our time'. another 20 years either side of my birth date, and i would not have seen and felt.... ....the big snit. william white. sheffield.
