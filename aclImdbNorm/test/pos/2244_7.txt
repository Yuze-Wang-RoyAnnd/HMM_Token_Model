age of steel follows up the previous episode, rise of the cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, lacking in others. rotc had some positive elements, the most important being tennant's excellent portrayal of the doctor. indeed, his sort of daft giddiness bears, to this writer, the shadow of tom baker's doctor, with his sort of subconscious asides (as when ticking off time periods when mickey is holding down the button in the tardis), yet brings his own aloof superiority a la mccoy's doctor as he lets events coalesce around him. some reviewers and fans whose pieces i've read seem a bit dismayed at having such a young actor portray someone who must by now be over a 1000 old, but i disagree. tennant's doctor does indeed "bear the weight of the world on his shoulders" as he points out in this episode, and one can see this in his almost smug characterization, as when he finally confronts lumic/the cybercontroller in the climax. his world-weary, eyes-rolling "anothermaniacherewegoagain" sort of attitude is refreshing, especially after eccleston's excellent pseudo-working class, bada** interpretation of the character, more the man of action than tennant's fresh-faced pseudo-doofus. tennant's best moment is perhaps after the end when he is restoring the tardis with his big goofy baker-esquire grin as the tardis re-starts. here we begin to get a feeling for this new doctor, a character who is little more than the average person's different personality facets split up into 13 different people; some contradictory, some more likable than others, yet all forming part of a whole. this aside, these two episodes were passable, but weak. the concept of reviving the cybermen is much welcomed, and they look fantastic, but the plot involving a parallel earth where this action takes place doesn't seem to work right. true, the allegory here of humans' reliance on technology and their need to serve it, as the doctor points out, is outstanding, but this could easily have been placed on contemporary earth or thereabouts. some other weak spots are, as others have pointed out, the ease with which the doctor and co. get out of the tight spots, viz. the death ray from the tardis component, the seemingly endless array of uses of the sonic screwdriver (my wife laughed when they were using it to burn through the rope ladder at the end; she has barely watched who, so i had to explain that it was used traditionally as a plot device to extricate the characters from situations from which there is no other escape! used here sadly). some of the acting was wanting, especially mickey, who really needs his due, and some of the supporting cast. lumic was creepy, as he needed to be, his voice even sounded cyberman-esquire. the score was horrific, though, with the music's volume often swamping out the scene. overall, i found rise of the cyberman more entertaining, though the second half was passable. the build-up to what we knew was inevitable plays out well, however the resolution was disappointing. too many unlikely escapes, no development of the supporting cast, and not enough tennant in my opinion. this new show is outstanding, and davies is taking it in a good direction, but the dialogue (beyond the doctor's) needs to be tightened up, as mickey's farewells illustrate, which were pure ham.
