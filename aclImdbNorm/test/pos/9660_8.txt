this is probably the best movie of 2002 regarding romanian cinema. i do recommend it being an intense drama with no lack of action and thrills. the movie concentrates upon teen life in the bucharest suburbs trough the main character, not focusing so much on the character's shape or definition but more on the anger that he and other characters feel. the title "furia" means rage rather than anger, but could be regarded in the movie in both senses from the behavior of actors. the rather odd love story (not a typical romantic one, but rather a modern suburban conception) is well shaped towards the end. it is a captivating picture, and cinematography is pretty good in catching the suburban night life thus making it a nice movie to watch and.<br /><br />you won't get bored for a minute, i promise!
