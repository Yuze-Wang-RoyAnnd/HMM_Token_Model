this is a great film for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. it's enjoyable, and a vaguely feel-good movie.<br /><br />a minor, but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we don't know why justine and chas broke up. okay, most first relationships don't work for one reason or another, but they more or less seemed like a nice couple.<br /><br />in a nutshell, it's worth a watch to escape reality.
