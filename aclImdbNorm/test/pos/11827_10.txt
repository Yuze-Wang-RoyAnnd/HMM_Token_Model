this one of the best and funniest comedy series i have ever seen! all characters are brilliant.<br /><br />mr. slatt (david bamber) is a very very irritated man, irritated by everything and anyone.<br /><br />he wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can, but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. not supported by his wife janet, who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into (and really does not need the help at all!).<br /><br />all characters are played/portrayed brilliantly. just imagine sending your kid(s) to a school like this.<br /><br />it is unbelievable that people do not like it (maybe some don not get the many many plays on words, that are featured many times per episode).<br /><br />it is also unbelievable that there is still no dvd release of it. there are only 2 series!<br /><br />so please, release it, let it go! so the fans can and will enjoy it!<br /><br />try it, you might just like it!!!<br /><br />just some names & words from the series: pumpman, man helmet, hot bitch, mount suzy, travis fellatio, cockfoster, arshead (and many many more).
