i saw this at the tribeca film festival, in the family section. i'm not sure either of my kids really got the movie, but i have to say that it was a wonderful short film.<br /><br />'nostradamus and me' is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all felt growing up in the 1980's, which in turn, extends to how my kids feel today. then, we had regan, today, we got bush. instead of nuclear war, we have terrorism.<br /><br />i really identified with the main character, and i myself dated a 'curehead' in high school. we all felt like 'nothing mattered' when we were 16, but it's great to see a film where they discover that everything matters!!! <br /><br />again, i probably wouldn't have put this in the family section...there were a few too many curse words for younger children, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable film to watch.
