when i watched this movie i had no idea what it was about, and i had never heard of it before. but i must say i was positively surprised. the first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie. the store clerk from india is just too funny! anyways, the story isn't really too much to talk about, but i think it's ok. the acting on the other hand is quite good, and still the only actor i recognized was mickey rourke who wasn't really in the movie until the ending. and the ending is where the turn-off is i think, it's not bad but i don't feel like it really ends. i feel like there should have been something more. a final battle in some way. i don't know. all in all, this was a good movie and i recommend it to anyone into tarantino-type movies with loads of violence and dark, sinister humor! i rate it 7/10.
