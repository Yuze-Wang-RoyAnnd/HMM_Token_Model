i would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film. it really does grip you. john paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings.<br /><br />i imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position (especially with children leaving home older but i wouldn't say wiser) with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery.<br /><br />i think this film should definitely have a wider audience. i would also say that the other actors played brilliant parts as well. it is such a deep film and very moving.
