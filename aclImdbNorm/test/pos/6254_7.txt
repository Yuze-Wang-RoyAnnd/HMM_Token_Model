the slasher sub-genre has been pretty much exhausted - in fact, even by 1979, just one year after the supposed 'first slasher', halloween (which was released seven years after bay of blood), was released; the sub-genre wasn't far from being exhausted; but tourist trap represents one of the more original outings. the film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - i.e. madman murders a load of kids, but draws its originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an unseen assailant or a man in a mask) and we actually get some insight into his character. the fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including being able to control the wax dummies that fill his house, adds to the originality. we kick off with a great opening sequence, which sees a young man fall foul of having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror. the scene is amazingly creepy, as the wax dummies taunt him and things fly from the shelves - and it gives the audience a great insight into what is to come; namely, a very creepy horror film! <br /><br />the acting credibility is as non-existent as you would expect from a seventies slasher, but to be honest; it's not all that bad. the girls look hot, the boys don't really matter; and chuck connors is more than adequately creepy in the role of the psycho. he's not exactly anthony perkins; but still, good enough. it's not the acting that's the star of the show, however, and as you might expect - the creepy atmosphere takes that prize. wax models, as proved by the likes of house of wax (vincent price version...) are very creepy; and the film makes best use of that fact. there are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. the killer's special ability could easy have gotten in the way of the atmosphere, but the film makes best use of this fact, even, by having various things fly off shelves and it goes well with the rest of the movie. on the whole, this is a very good film. while tourist trap might not be absolutely essential viewing; it's well worth seeing and i can recommend it.
