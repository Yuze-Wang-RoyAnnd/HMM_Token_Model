billy crystal is larry, a writer who hasn't written and is suspected of murder in "throw momma from the train," costarring danny devito and anne ramsey. the phrase "black comedy" was invented for this insanity, which is a take-off on hitchcock's "strangers on a train." in fact, owen (devito) gets the idea of having larry kill his mother in exchange for owen killing larry's ex from watching that famous film. "i saw the movie. criss-cross," owen tells larry. not that larry knows what he's talking about until it appears it's too late - just like "strangers." larry, a writing teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by kate mulgrew, stole his book and put her name on it. she has become a big celebrity, appearing on "oprah," where she refers to larry as "a beast." owen is in larry's class. he lives with an abusive neanderthal mother (ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her, sticking a scissors in her head - you name it. it's not long after seeing "strangers on a train" that he's in honolulu, stalking larry's wife. while she's leaning over a boat railing trying to get an earring, owen stands behind her and creeps up...soon the police are looking for larry to question him, but he's at owen's where he's being encouraged to live up to his end of a bargain he had no idea he made. you know, "criss-cross." there are several scenes copied from "strangers," which are hilarious. i especially loved larry's confession to the sleeping mrs. lift, owen's mother, similar to when guy thinks he's talking to bruno's stepfather.<br /><br />crystal and devito are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will leave you laughing, often out loud. ramsey is repulsively funny - a totally "out there" performance. kim griest and rob reiner also have roles - griest is crystal's girlfriend, and reiner has what amounts to a cameo.<br /><br />the ending is very clever, and the whole film will leave you laughing.
