this without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies i have ever seen. i really enjoyed the characters in the movie. they are all wonderful bizarre in them selves. it's quite something i have never seen before in any movie.<br /><br />the story is almost non-stop from beginning to the end. there are no boring moments. i was totally captured by the movie. and i thought the acting was great.<br /><br />so if you want to see a fun movie. you should look for the green butchers. a great movie.<br /><br />i give it 10/10
