leos carax has made 3 great movies: boys meet girls, mauvais sang, les amants du pont neuf. in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth, the beauty of juvenile wilderness. carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was, but he tried to make his own vision of the art, without thinking about about all he have seen, but using it and melting it into his times. pola x is a very different movie because carax made les amants du pont neuf, a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars, a film that has destroyed everything on its way. after such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view. so leos carax has to changed, and he did. the movie isn't as beautiful as its first, it's more reasonable, no more studio, no more dreamed paris, carax has entered at last reality. it's not clean anymore, it's not poetic characters. carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it.
