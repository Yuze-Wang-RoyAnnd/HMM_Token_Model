this is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s. otto preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. frank sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by elmer bernstein is dynamite. from the opening titles (by saul bass) to the hysteria of drug addict frank going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie! with kim novak (giving a very good performance), eleanor parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as darren mcgavin as the reptilian pusher and arnold stang as frank's grifter pal. beware of bad prints: this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough.
