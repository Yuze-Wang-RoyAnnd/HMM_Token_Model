this documentary on dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well made. however, i found myself watching many of the bits with unease. the film generally took a rather confident stand on anything it said and showed, but inevitably much of the behaviour of the beasts, their interaction with each other, what they looked like, how they moved, what they ate etc. much of that is surely guessing - sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence, sometimes just wild guessing. but the viewer is never made aware of that, the film pretends to actually observe real dinosaurs and their real behaviour etc. that makes probably better viewing than confronting the audience with mountains of disclaimers, but it makes it just a bit too populist in my estimation.
