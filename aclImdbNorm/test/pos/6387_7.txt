as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clich'ed movies that hollywood makes. there seems to be no creativity in hollywood. companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in.<br /><br />this movie is a welcome change. it could be classified as romantic comedy for it's genre but don't let that turn you off this movie. this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces.<br /><br />if you are reading this, you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that. the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are "interstate 60" and "art of travel" which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage.<br /><br />this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same.<br /><br />dean
