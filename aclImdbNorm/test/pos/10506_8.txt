this movie will undoubtably not go over well with some, because most of the horror is mental. but it does have a little something for almost everyone, including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens. the film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology, while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie. jillian mcwhirter is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance.
