i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other. i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago. this movie contained an all-star cast, and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before. this movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of it. it is a movie that you can sit down with your family and watch, though we would have to cover the kids eyes a few times due to the discretionary love scenes. overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale. lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.
