what a shame this movie was never released. (it is now playing on cable.) i tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones i've been paying to see in theatres recently. i like to be surprised. so often movies are marketed as "offbeat," but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. this movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. jonathan pryce sings like an angel. even though he is required by the plot to sing some of the most mawkishly sentimental songs ever written, he does them so well one doesn't mind. cathy bates and rupert everett are well-cast and superb, but a newcomer in the role of cathy bates' daughter-in-law steals every scene she is in. give this film a chance.
