a man arrives in a strange, beautiful, sterile city where no-one feels any emotion and obsesses instead about interior design. the essential sameness of his days is reminiscent of 'groundhog day'; the strange passages in and out of this world more remind one of 'being john malkovich'. but truly, this is a scandanavian movie, a piece of self-satire that is also scandanavian in style: the tone is austere, and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight, daring you to laugh at the absurdity. to my mind, the combination isn't wholly successful: there aren't enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama. it certainly is original; perhaps my problem is that the world that it satirises is not one that i recognise. perhaps i should move to scandanavia!
