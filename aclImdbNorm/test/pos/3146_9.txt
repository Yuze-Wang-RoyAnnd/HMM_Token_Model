in the world of "shorts" (most of which aren't), this film is a gem.<br /><br />a quiet, concise peek into the world of a young woman who's a reader for a blind woman, here the stellar elizabeth franz - this film bears the textures, layers and visual storytelling of a sumptuously painted still life.<br /><br />the dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is stunning, and the direction sure, clear and compelling. i saw this film in a film festival held in a loud and crowded tribeca bar - and within the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd fell quiet.<br /><br />that says it all.
