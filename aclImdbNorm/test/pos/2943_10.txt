i don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought, "that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper bs". so i decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. <br /><br />i must tell you, i was happily surprised. i went to this film with no expectations. i didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision. alberta watson also did a fantastic job as the role of tamara's disease-stricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of megan park as tamara's friend brenda. <br /><br />the film was wonderfully directed by gail harvey, and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50's way that leaves you feeling warm and happy, even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting. i also thought that the film was well-shot, many beautiful images of a 1950's countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come. <br /><br />this film as a whole was quirky and great. i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open-ended way, i was still left satisfied. whether you are looking for a fun, yet powerful coming-of-age story, or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950's, i guarantee this film is for you. even if you have no expectations, it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed. give this one a shot!
