clifton webb as "mr. scoutmaster" is one of the all-time greats for comedy and remembering an innocence, now diminished in the world. i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie, although i have requested it time and again.<br /><br />this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty, respect, dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis. there is so much low self-esteem talked about in present daily lives, but this movie, among many, many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for the present-day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself. sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences. it certainly appealed to us 'baby boomer' generation of yesterday. old lessons are universal and timeless.
