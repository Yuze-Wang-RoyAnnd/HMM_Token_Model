tom fontana's unforgettable "oz" is hands down one of the greatest television series ever created. brilliantly written, acted, and directed it is as close to perfection in any art form (film, television, literature, music) as it gets. haunting in it's extreme brutality it creates a prison world filled with diverse characters that range from compassionate to flat out terrifying. it is a show that no matter how brutal it is get through, one cannot take its eyes off of. the combination of professional trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of diverse and all original performances.<br /><br />and while the show is universally praised and has/had a loyal fan base, one cannot feel that it was under-appreciated during it's television run because of other hbo dramas such as "the sopranos", "sex and the city", and "six feet under". and while all those shows are fine and borderline masterpieces in their right, many people forget that it was "oz" that was hbo's first entry into one-hour television drama series. it was a brave, risky first entry and with it hbo hit a grand slam with it. this is as good as it gets.
