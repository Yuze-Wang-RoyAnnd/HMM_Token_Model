like many other commentators here, i went in expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and got more than i asked for. i heard and saw a powerful, exquisite, sometimes haunting, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the truest way) and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians. reminded me a lot of some forms of indian music (east indian) but at the same time was very very different.<br /><br />starting from the the first track by baba zula to the kurdish singer aynur (what a voice) to siyasiyabend to the jam session (or 'jugalbandhi ' as we call it in india) in the small turkish bar ft. selim seslar (big fan now :) ), i enjoyed every minute and wished it wouldn't end.<br /><br />one of the best music commentaries i have seen and heard in a long time. <br /><br />i am craving for a cd of the sound-track and hope i can find it online somewhere soon and also for old and latest albums from baba zula.<br /><br />a day later, the music is still etched in my brain and i don't want it to go away. turkey and specifically istanbul now seem such beautiful and exciting places - and i am going to start saving today to go take it in.<br /><br />faith akin - this is a gem.
