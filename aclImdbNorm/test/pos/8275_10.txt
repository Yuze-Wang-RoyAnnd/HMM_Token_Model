plot in a nutshell: dave seville, father figure & manager of the chipmunk brothers alvin, simon & theodore, has gone off to europe on a business trip, leaving the boys at home with miss miller as their watcher, much to the chagrin of alvin, who wanted to go to europe. while playing against his female counterpart, brittany, the leader of the chipettes, comprised of her younger sisters jeanette (the female counterpart of simon) and eleanor (the female counterpart of theodore) in a fierce arcade game of around the world in 30 days, they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money & diamonds around the world, but need a way to do it that won't draw the attention of their arch enemy, jamal. the 2 evil siblings, claudia & klaus, overhear the banter between alvin & brittany and decide to use them as the delivery boys & girls for their loot (more claudia's idea than klaus's, the latter initially objects feeling that it's too dangerous for children). the 2 siblings make an offer to the boys & girls - travel via air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls (which resemble the kids) that contain diamonds and/or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money. but as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds, they are stalked by the henchmen of jamal - but who is jamal? is he friend or foe? <br /><br />overall: enjoyable, lighthearted farce based on the 1980s tv series version of alvin & the chipmunks. beautiful animation is a highlight, lacks the crude humor that keeps creeping into today's family films and engaging songs (boys & girls of rock & roll being a stand out). eagle eyed fans will probably notice that brittany's character design has been tweaked from the animated series, giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to cheeks (which jeanette & eleanor also display).<br /><br />keep an ear out for nancy cartwright, the voice of bart simpson.
