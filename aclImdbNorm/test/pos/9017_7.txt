in england we often feel very attached to british films that we like, as we are so used to the usual american settings and accents. being from london, where virtual sexuality is set, i felt a strong emotional attachment to it. the characters in virtual sexuality, particularly the females, are exactly what british teenagers are like, i felt like i was almost in the film. i immediately related to the character of alex from the film, his shyness is quite common in most british teenage boys, especially around girls. virtual sexuality made me feel really good as its one of the only british films that isn't about gangsters or the middle-upper class, but about the people who are watching the film, average teenagers. americans wouldn't really feel the emotional attachment, but every british teenager should watch it. anyone from london will recognise the parts of the city from the film, it's definately got a special place in my video box!
