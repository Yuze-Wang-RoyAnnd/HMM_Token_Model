perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny. maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it. but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in. and that is, " nice guys finish last ".<br /><br />there is a line in angel heart from lisa bonet's character that says " it takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster. " true. most likely. women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever. but ( at least at an early age ) they end up going for the good looking, slimy, disrespectful, untamed guy. the one they know they can't conform to their beliefs. and that is part of the attraction. after all, what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be? i believe this may have happened to boaz davidson. and what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to, is that you will get your heart broken. it happens to everyone and it will happen to you. and that is a strong final statement in the film. but having said all that, the movie is fun. it is funny and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well.<br /><br />this is a rare film that is sleezy enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it;s like to get your heart broken. no highschool film has ever done this better. like i said, i think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand. maybe we all have.<br /><br />this is an old film, but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night, pick it up, you may be surprised. it is a hell of a lot better than never been kissed.
