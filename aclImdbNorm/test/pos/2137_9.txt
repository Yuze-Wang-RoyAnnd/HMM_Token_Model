i'ts like going around in a museum. you can appreciate the great talent of the main composer, michael cimino & this fabulous art desinger of light ..vilmos zsigmond. as i said i'ts like being in heaven discovering all the creation this man can applied to a single frame. imagine when you can look at a moving picture of this artist. i can say: this film is one of the best.
