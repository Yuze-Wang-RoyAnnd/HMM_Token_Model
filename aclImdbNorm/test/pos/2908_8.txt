this fox spectacle was a big hit when released in 1954. sumptiously produced, with great music and sets, intriguing cast, it moves slowly, but interestingly. edmund purdom is strikingly handsome as an egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor, juggling three stunning women: a handmaiden jean simmons who passively adores him, temptress bella darvi who eludes him, and a pharoah's sister gene tieney who wants him as her pharoah. the movie's popularity has not waned, since being re-shown on amc (preferably in widescreen). purdom is particulary great, his character apparently striking out with the women, and ending up never married and a "thinker." darvi is amazing and tantalizing in her femme fatale role. victor mature, michael wilding, peter ustinov co-star. check it out.
