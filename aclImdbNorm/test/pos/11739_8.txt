on a second viewing, this is still a wonderful romance that is, in my opinion, much better than the film it came paired with on my 2-dvd set, the leo mccarey weepie classic "an affair to remember". yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly (only a 6.6 rating here on imdb, and dismissed by many critics as "gooey slush"). how sad, because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leads, jennifer jones and william holden. if anything the film should be well-remembered for the gorgeous colour cinematography and the unforgettable musical score. i don't much like valentine's day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and i'm glad of it. while i still think holden's character death is too heavily foreshadowed, taking suspense out of the final scenes, this film is very moving and i really enjoy it.
