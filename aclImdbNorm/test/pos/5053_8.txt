up front, if you're tired, the first hour could be slow. the set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace, unhurried - giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in. once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline, the turn of events will keep you hooked: how will things turn out, what will happen to our precious fanda (portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran czech actor vlastimil brodsk'y), how will his wife (wonderfully played by stella z'azvorkov'a) treat him, what happens to fanda's dear friend ed (played by stanislav zindulka - a matching sidekick to brodsk'y), and j'ara the son with selfish hidden agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!)<br /><br />vladim'ir mich'alek sensibly directed the film with sprinkles of humor, preserving the insightful script by jir'i hubac. thanks to clear subtitling, i was able to notice for every 'complaining' phrase fanda's wife utters, there's a hint of 'caringness' showing/buried in between the lines - and so did the judicious lady judge observed. fanda is '76 going on 80' and the affection of their enduring (endearing) marriage manifests even in their bantering arguments. his playfulness can be infectious.<br /><br />this is 'growing old together 101' for (at least) the beyond fifties, and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted. one may need to rethink if assuming 'home for the aged' is a means to an end, so to speak. the film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can. (hint: there's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll.)<br /><br />we're fortunate to be able to see an occasional czech film. the sver'ak ("kolya") father & son's 2001 "dark blue world" was revealing with pathos. it's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem - its subtitles, scenery, melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances. "autumn spring" (aka bab'i l'eto) is available on dvd. enjoy!
