a must see!<br /><br />excellent positive african-american love story. this movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad. more true to life characters looking for love, being in love, and loosing it. old story fresh view. larenz tate was so cary grant in style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out. nia long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough, almost like a kathrine hepburn. this is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man<br /><br />this movie is a classic, superb acting, well written, a real love story set in chicago, what more can you ask for?<br /><br />superb black love story<br /><br />amsterdam, holland
