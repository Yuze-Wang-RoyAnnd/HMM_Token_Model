no, it's not citizen kane. but would you expect it to be with a name like "meatballs"? it's the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies. does anyone quote "little darlings" line by line? or "whitewater summer"?<br /><br />this is just one of those movies that got into my brain when i was in junior high, and stayed with me all these years. every time i feel geeky, i mumble "spaz. spaz. spaz. spaz." or when we're hiking in the brush in the forest, i tell my husband, "i'm wudy da wabbit." (he doesn't get it). "it just doesn't matter. it just doesn't matter." i mean, this stuff is classic!<br /><br />disappointed with the dvd, though. wish there were special features, maybe a commentary or a making-of. but the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of life as an adolescent in the late '70s. maybe not my life... you can't help but want to run around out in the woods in shorty shorts and knee-high socks and feathered hair every time you see this movie.
