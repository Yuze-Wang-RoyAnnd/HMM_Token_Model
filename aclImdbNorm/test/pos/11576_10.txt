once again almen'abar has provided us with a top quality film. this director is amazing, and he's proven that he's equally talented and effective when crossing genres. <br /><br />the excellent character development of the movie, through dialogue and personality quirks, but with more subtle details as well (ramon's father's gaze), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely, making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound. the visuals are at times, simple, at times stunning (the dream to the beach), and i think almen'abar's films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it matched the film's varying moods flawlessly.<br /><br />more than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life (albeit in a quite limited way), and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die. the overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well-timed quips of humor, which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel.<br /><br />although clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of ramon's friends and family. most poignant was ramon's father, when he said, despondent, "there's only one thing worse than losing a child. that the child wants to die."<br /><br />excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.
