i started watching this one very tensed because i heard so many different things about it. somewhere i read it was a drama about child abuse and rated pg-13 for violence. another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of kids (and i thought it was also for kids to watch). well, now i've seen it so many times and still don't know in which category to put it. it is extremely funny at times but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. because of the nice relationship and the adventures i would like to recommend this film to all the youngsters i know but i fear the somber atmosphere is not suitable for children. because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film i must say this nevertheless: watch it, especially the kids! the last thing i have to say is that i hate the scriptwriter for letting poor bobby never see his family again after having fled from the king (who didn't even return to terrorize the remained mary and mikey). it is very good for this film not to have a perfect happy ending with everybody being happy - and i didn't expect it to - but this solution left me very, very sad!
