"robin hood: men in tights" has received no respect whatsoever. it was hilarious! cary elwes was excellent as the "prince of thieves," and david chappelle, amy yasbeck, patrick stewart, richard lewis and mark blankfield as blinkin all did fine jobs. i will never understand the hostility toward "robin hood: men in tights," but i do know a great comedy when i see one.<br /><br />"robin hood: men in tights" receives *** out of ****.
