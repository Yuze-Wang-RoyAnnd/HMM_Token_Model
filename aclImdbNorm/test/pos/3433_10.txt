first of all - i hardly ever watch swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life i watch a swedish movie on cinema! therefor, i believe it's one of the best swedish movies ever! the combination of thrill and humour is outstanding, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! the plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to germany after world war ii and help the germans to start over. on the way to germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea. what a clumsy jerk! and poor robert gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always get in the way ... ouch!!! but he still got his great mood. a positive guy. robert gustafsson have done some less great movies the last years or so, and this is really a relief. he is great in this movie. after all - this is one of the best swedish movies ever, and peter dalle has made an excellent job! congratulations!
