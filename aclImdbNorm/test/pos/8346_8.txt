lady and the tramp ii is very colourfully animated, and the songs, especially that of the junkyard dogs, are quite good. however, the family seems even too idyllic, and i can't help understanding that scamp is discontented when everything is forbidden. however, i also pity angel who never has had a loving family until she meets jim dear and darling.<br /><br />in any case, it's clear that the original lady and the tramp is better than this sequel.
