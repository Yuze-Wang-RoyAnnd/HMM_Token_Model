i seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago and whenever it gets aired again somewhere (which luckily happens from time to time in european cable television) i experience the same thing, i'm moved, entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this one.<br /><br />it all deals with leo (kevin mckidd) and his group of friends living in urban london, leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to a hilarious new age men's group and falls for straight guy brendon, played by dashing james purefoy, who turns out not so straight after all. thrown in as side characters are the equally great tom hollander and hugo weaving whose side story alone is worth watching the movie, simon callow as the leader of the men's group, turning in a great as ever performance. but it's really hard to pick some folks out here, because every character, the female ones like jennifer ehle's, julie graham's and harriet walter's as well, are exquisitely acted. maybe even kevin mckidd looks a little pale compared to his co-actors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character.<br /><br />the idea behind this movie is a simple one: there is never only black and white, classifications are difficult and may not always stand the test of time.<br /><br />leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and brendon's long time girlfriend. brendon starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all. darren and jeremy (hollander and weaving) are gay and loving it and even the straight folks in the movie, like angie, leo's female roommate, get their fair share of love and funny moments up until the end of the movie. the comedy bits(especially tom hollander who's just hilarious) are funny and on point and the emotions are believable, as confusing as they may appear at times reading this summary.<br /><br />what i like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion. whether you're gay, straight, bisexual or simply not sure, this movie leaves you feeling that it's just okay not to be sure and that "not being sure" might be something worth living out as well! sexuality is portrayed fluid in this movie and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem with it, apart from all the gay/straight camp fights that you sometimes get fed with in other gay themed movies. i can only wholeheartedly agree with the subtext of the movie, that what you feel certain of one day, when you think you identify as gay, straight, whatever, can look very different on another. i have never seen (what to call it?) bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification being portrayed in such a heartwarming and true to life manner. <br /><br />this movie dares going where few movies go, gay or straight movies, by not playing on labels and stereotypical assumption of sex and relying on that. it goes further and assumes that there may be a life to sex after well-known classifications and i think the times are more than ready for that and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this one! <br /><br />and for all others who don't care about that, heck, it's just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy saturday evening with some popcorn on your hands. give it a try!<br /><br />loved it!
