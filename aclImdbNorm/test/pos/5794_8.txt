little vera is the story of a russian teenager, her family, and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life sliding increasingly into decay. in her search for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious sergei, whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly spirals out of control.<br /><br />little vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way. the drinking of the father, the enabling and lack of understanding of the mother, the casual lies and misdirection of the brother, and vera herself forgiving them all their flaws are all shocking and slightly disturbing to watch. however, the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters. set in cramped spaces and vast urban decay, little vera presented a vastly different view of soviet life than had ever been seen before. in fact, little vera is a portrait of the collapse of soviet society painted in shades of pain, desperation, and rust. it is the implosion of a family set against the implosion of an entire social order.<br /><br />although painful and desperately unsatisfying, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, if only to understand the feelings and cultures still reshaping russia today.
