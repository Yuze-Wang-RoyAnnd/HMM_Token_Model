thank god that there are films out there that don't follow the same old hollywood crap formula. i think the digital revolution and the dvd revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it. i love it when a film takes its time to draw you in deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reaches. it really was like taking a trip through the soul of america and that soul is disturbed and confused. what really blew my mind was the way they used martin luther king's speeches about vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. i found myself choked up every time i heard his voice. i've heard him speak before, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like i understood his message in a way i'd never thought about.<br /><br />what can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be? in fact, there's no credits at all in the film. you have to access them by selecting them in the features. somehow that made me think a lot. all in all i can't say enough about this dvd. brilliant.
