can't get much eerier than flatliners. this deep, dark film had my heart pumping throughout. the lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a death defying experience, literally. keifer is in top form as he is today in 24. he's a great actor and he plays a very convincing and shocking role you won't forget for years to come. and what can you say for the rest of the cast? an all-star lineup, julia is hotter than ever, will, oliver, and kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you gripping your seats. it's a refreshing sight to see a true thriller, with top notch professional actors. you won't regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender. -jl
