if we compare the movie industry with an ocean, we have the tendencies to observe only the surface. driven by the strong hollywood marketing force, we all saw war movies like saving private ryan, the thin red line, apocalypse now or full metal jacket. but underneath the splashy waves grow in silence, from time to time, less known pearls. when you pick one and look carefully at it, you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why it's not already on the crown.<br /><br />"stalingrad" is such a gem. why, it has a bunch of multi-million dollars rated actors? no. it have thousand of extras? no. it have breathtaking, spectacular, shiny computerized visual effects?. not at all. so, what's so special? well, in one word, it's pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later. the tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here. filthy, wounded soldiers, russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burning villages, collapsing buildings, decayed suburbs, gunfires, explosions, tanks in flames, soldiers shot, burned alive, ground by tanks in their pits or shred to pieces - you got all. but the real horror is elsewhere. people are reduced to simple pawns, without the power to change anything. the soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail. the civilians stay in prostration in the middle of nowhere, only crying for their children killed. mercyless, the huge grinding machine of war melt together humans, equipment, villages, cities - and ask for more victims and destruction, over and over.<br /><br />in all this collective insanity a group of german soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of normality. they do their duty and fight bravely. but, as everyone know, a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith. we see how all those people are abandoned, how they plan to desert, how they struggle to catch the very last plane to berlin (full of wounded), how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shot, how they were forced to execute a small group of russian civilians, including a young boy, how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks - destined only for some "superior" officers, of course. one by one, they drop dead. the end of the movie is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching ending i ever saw, all on the magnificent score of the munich philarmonic orchestra. the war destroyed everything in its path.<br /><br />this movie is a must-see for everyone. a true movie-lover should have it in his/her collection. the strong anti-war message must be a warning for all of us. unfortunately, the mankind never learn, nor the politicians. self-destruction is in our dna and the human pain seem to last forever. can we be enough reasonable to stop the war?
