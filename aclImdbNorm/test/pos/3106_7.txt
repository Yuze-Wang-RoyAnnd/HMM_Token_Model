on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. they make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. if you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.<br /><br />this is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it. the cast is across the board excellent and they're more than willing to have a good time with what is good material.<br /><br />i would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre, it should have been, but for me something happened on the way that made me down grade the rating to only seven out of ten. i can't tell you what it is, not for certain anyway. perhaps its the sense that i knew where it was going almost from the outset, or perhaps its something else, i'm not sure what, but there was something that i couldn't shake that made me like this film despite wanting to love it. it just missed being great and somehow fell short.<br /><br />that said i do suggest you see it. it is after all a very witty film, that entertains fully, despite just missing being great.
