this is a gently amusing coming-of-age comedy that comes from the later, more mature period of neil simon's writing. although there are plenty of wisecracks to go around, this is not one of those neil simon pieces where every character spouts out one-liner jokes for 2 hours like they're guest stars on a bob hope special. there are also dramatic elements (some work, some are overkill) that lend some weight to the story.<br /><br />the performances are good across the board, especially blythe danner as the mother (although she and judith ivey were oddly wasp-ish choices to play jewish women). i've never been a fan of jonathan silverman, but i will say that he hits the right notes as the obnoxious, gawky, and totally horned-up teen-age narrator/protagonist of the story.<br /><br />the movie is very similar in tone to woody allen's "radio days," but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this one.
