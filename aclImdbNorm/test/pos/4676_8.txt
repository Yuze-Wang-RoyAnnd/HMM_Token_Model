one of the perks of my job is that when things are slow, i can watch the movie in our downstairs theater (i work in a little 2-screen theater) in the cry room and still keep an eye on the concession stand. i have seen italian job probably 20 times, and i'm still not tired of it. the atmosphere reminds me of ocean's eleven, although the acting isn't as good. mark wahlberg is ok, charlize theron appeals to the guys, but seth green is awesome in this movie. i thought edward norton did a very good job playing a dirtbag, although a lot of people disagree. i also enjoyed mos def as the explosives expert that's afraid of dogs. i highly recommend this movie, and will continue to watch it whenever i can!
