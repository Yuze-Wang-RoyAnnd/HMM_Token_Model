what can you possibly say? this is the uncut hardcore, musical alice! it works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, i guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. pretty much a delight throughout. there are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. it also could have been and today would have been too camp. no, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough. fine performances particularly the kristine debell in the lead and was that an unaccredited richard prior as the prone knight being vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?
