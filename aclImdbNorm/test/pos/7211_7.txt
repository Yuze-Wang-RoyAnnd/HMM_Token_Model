can this really be a troma movie? some scenes almost have an "a" movie look. the acting is generally competent (the two leads and the nurse-surrogate were especially good, and i liked some of the confrontations between the young capulets and ques); the scenes were smoothly edited; the plot is coherent. it's funny. it has a hip, original sound track.<br /><br />it does have the usual troma gross-outs and low humor, but i don't think shakespeare would have minded so much. in fact, i think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this.<br /><br />it's a good dvd. there is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director, several deleted scenes, and the usual collection of troma self-deprecating silliness.<br /><br />i'm not going to tell you this was citizen kane, but it is some pretty inspired low-budget filmmaking.
