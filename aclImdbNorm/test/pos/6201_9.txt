i don't understand why this show didn't go on there could've been various ways to continue on the line of darwin and farik after season 2, obviously darwin couldn't have been the uc agent infiltrating cells and sabotageing them from the inside, but still they should've given this show at least another season.<br /><br />the show is well casted, believable, and views the islamic religion from both the normal and the extremist point of view. it touches controversial subjects in detail and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows nowdays. i'm actually sad that i didn't know about this show until late 2007.
