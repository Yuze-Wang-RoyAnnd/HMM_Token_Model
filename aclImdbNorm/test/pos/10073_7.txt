so, madonna isn't meryl streep. still, this is one of her first films and a comedy at that. give her a break! sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w/ katherine hepburn, bringing up baby. for what it is, though(a piece of fluff), it's quite a bit of fun to watch. i've yet to hear anyone that slams madonna's acting skills back it up w/ evidence or even adjectives other than "awful", "bad", or other such vague descriptive words. if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about whitney houston?? she's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn't act her way out of a hatbox. the american public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power. i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies. get real people. madonna-bashing is so 90's.
