spanish director luis bu~nuel career spanned almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. arguably, his best films were those he made during his exile in mexico - from the late forties to the early 60s. there he had to deal with very cheap budgets, and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences, yet he somehow managed to make interesting, thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time. this movie is based on a novel by spanish author benito perez galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the setting is now early 20th century mexico instead of early 20th century spain. the protagonist, nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by christ. the question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible, without incurring in the hostility, incomprehension and mockery of your fellow human beings. as it happens, he suffers a lot of indignities, yet he remains stubborn (until the controversial final shot) to this objective. i think bu~nuel wanted to show nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) comes out as admirable. in any case, a great film.
