as a fan of the old doctor who, and after the mediocre fox movie, i was dubious of this new series of doctor who. i gave it a chance though, and am so glad i did.<br /><br />yes, some episodes aren't as brilliant as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, eccleston's doctor is far from any we've had before but... eccleston's doctor is just about the best there is. his performance is at times comical, at others dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic.<br /><br />this, and bille piper as rose make this series a cut above the rest (camille coduri is also fantastic as rose's mum), and there is a depth to this series not present previously. this series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its sci-fi. i mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a dalek prior to this, how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with rose's dad, the emergency doctor and the 'you were fantastic...so was i' final speech? i advise anyone, whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd, it truly is "fantastic!".<br /><br />now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new cybermen) i have to say that david tennant's doctor is just not as good, of course you may disagree, but i don't think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series. i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last, however the return of sarah jane & k9 was a fantastic episode, a true gem. not to say this series is not good, just not quite as good.<br /><br />so whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer tennant or eccleston, the doctor is back, and he's here to stay. "fantastic!" - almost as many "fantastic!"'s as the doctor! -
