during wwii, there were a bazillion movies created by hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to seem alike. however, over 21 is unique in so many ways, as it shows a side of the war you won't see in other films--making it well worth seeing, even if you have seen the bazillion other films! <br /><br />alexander knox plays the male lead, but the real lead of the film is irene dunne--who looks amazing for a 47 year-old lady (yes, i checked--she really was this old when she made the film). in over 21, the pair play husband and wife. he enlists in the military, much to the consternation of his father (charles coburn) and owner of the newspaper where knox is employed, and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school. the film shows little of knox in the school but instead centers on dunne as she lives in nearby spartan housing for spouses. during this time, she (as the british say) keeps a 'stiff upper lip' and makes the best of it--even though she really isn't a housewife but a famous professional writer. occasionally she gets very brief visits from her harried husband but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the meddling coburn at bay. eventually, she decides to stop the pesky coburn from phoning incessantly (he always complains that his paper won't survive without his son) by pretending to be knox--writing wonderful editorials that everyone just assumes were written by him.<br /><br />while there is nothing earth-shaking in this film, it's a very interesting slice of life move. additionally, the acting all around is very good. it's interesting that this film is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced of ruth gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, garson kanin (also a famous screenwriter as well as director). when kanin joined the military during wwii, gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this film.<br /><br />by the way, i noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it. while it was very good, it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was short-lived.
