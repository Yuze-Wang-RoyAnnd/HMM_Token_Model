this film has not been seen by me in quite a few years. it came on the disney channel in the wee hours of the morning. i stayed up to watch it, and found it even more entertaining than the first time. the story, the scenery and the characters are as good as they come. i know that if anyone takes the time to view this film, they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time. it's very memorable in more ways than one. i would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for all concerned.<br /><br />s
