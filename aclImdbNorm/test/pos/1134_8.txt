so when i first saw commercials for greek i did have a few questions to how they were going to approach greek life, if they were going to give away sacred frat and sorority secrets, if they were going to focus on the brother and sisterhood a fraternity or sorority brings, or what most college kids think of greek life as a huge party.<br /><br />luckily, it covered everything. the story plot was great, it gave you a character to love, hate, someone you want to be like, someone you don't want to be like, and of course a crazy roommate!<br /><br />it was one of my first looks at what writers believed greek life to be like, and i can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead on.<br /><br />i love how one of the biggest things they covered throughout the season was the relationship between rusty and his crazy roommate. its hard enough moving away from home, and being forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know, then come to find out.. you have nothing in common. probably every college bound freshmens worst nightmare.<br /><br />rustys sister casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus everyone is jealous of. what didn't she have? oh thats right.. evan all to herself. rebecca and evan had an "affair" early into the season, which made you feel fairly sympathetic for casey. her character evolved, and her relationship with rusty became more and more loving and outgoing. <br /><br />cappie is one of the most fun loving characters, and absolutely insane. one of my favorite episodes included him getting completely trashed at a strip club, and rusty having to call casey to bail them out. i like how they addressed the issue of gay people in greek houses, calvin was a very real feeling character, and i really respected him because he stuck to his standards. so jen k was fairly crazy, but she actually liked rusty. it was surprising and i continued to question her from the start, but of course, i did want it to work out between her and rusty.<br /><br />i am definitely looking forward to the return of greek. it takes you into the truth of greek life, something that a lot of people look past. one of the biggest things that frats and sororities are known for is parties and drinking. greek is a great show, and the characters are easy to relate to.
