i saw this film when it first came out, and didn't know what to expect exactly. what followed the overture was one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences i have ever had. a lush score of songs and music by britisher leslie bricusse (of doctor doolittle & wilie wonka and the chocolate factory fame as well as making his mark on the broadway musical scene), and scored by the incomparable john williams. there's not a bad song in the entire film. plus some of the most exquisite cinematography, costume design and filming locations i have ever seen in one film. not to mention the academy award nominated performance by peter o'toole, and the equally strong performance, in my opinion, by the wonderful petula clark. now, given that peter is not the same caliber a singer that petula is, he still manages to sell his songs to the audience, and that, after all, is what it is all about. this is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by james hilton, and deserves to be treasured for generations to come. i recommend this film for family viewing, though most men will consider this a 'chick' flick. but if you like a truly great film musical, then this film is for you. but be warned that a standby box of kleenex is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure.
