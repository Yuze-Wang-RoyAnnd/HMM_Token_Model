okay...so i am gazing through my mom and dad's extensive dvd collection (mostly because they don't charge late fees;-)) and i come upon "a thousand acres." i was stunned that here was a movie that had jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer (with a small appearance by jennifer jason leigh) that i had not seen. i don't think i had ever even heard of it before. well, this is exactly the kind of find that i dream about since i have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me. with a few exceptions (neither of us can even get them to consider watching the lord of the rings movies, but my dad loves the matrix trilogy -- go figure), we have very similar tastes in movies.<br /><br />it was a particularly awful day today, weather-wise. it poured rain all day, so i popped in this movie and shortly after i was mesmerized.<br /><br />this has to be one of the all-time best "sleepers" i have seen. jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer are great in their roles especially since they are playing very different types. jessica lange's character is a people-pleasing follower who, despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role. rather, she bows to her father (jason robards) and sister rose (pfeiffer) and is hell-bent on teaching her little sister caroline (leigh) how to follow suit. michelle pfeiffer plays a very strong willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained. this movie is five years prior to white oleander, mind you, so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong, angry character.<br /><br />i would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women. however, true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them. i don't know how i missed seeing this movie before now, but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. enjoy!!
