i can't explain it, but i find this movie not only funny, but so enjoyable i feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least i did when i had cable tv. i always felt it was a really poorly made movie, but perhaps that is because i watched it on cable. i plan to get a dvd of this movie to really take an honest look at at, but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. i liked the plot and the idea of the movie and i especially liked the cast. i always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in and this is no exception. this film deserved a better fate than it received and kelsey grammar deserved at least one love scene with ms. holly. who wouldn't? the characters in this movie were the kind of guys i could identify with when i was in the military and the zaniness was exact. nice going troops.
