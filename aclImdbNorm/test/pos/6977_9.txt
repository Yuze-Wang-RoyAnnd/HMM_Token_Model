newly-pregnant knight bolts from husband for non-specific reasons which are apparently self-related. on the road, she becomes entangled with caan, brain-damaged former football star, and duvall, wacky but abusive cop. the type of movie that could only have been spawned in the 60's. worth a look for its non-formula plot and for early performances by future stars.<br /><br />disappointing resolution does not take away too much from rest of flick, which shows an interesting slice of life.
