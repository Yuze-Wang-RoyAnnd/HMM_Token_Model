the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character, fanda. he's an older man living in the late autumn of his life, yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy who's just entered a spring meadow. the frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. his wife supports this idea when she observes, "fanda laughs at funerals and death." in other words, death is not something fanda takes too seriously; he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable. life, however, and the pursuit of living life to its fullest, is the philosophy that governs fanda's existence. he is not one to merely exist, but must live for each day and each passing moment, for tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /><br />the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow, let alone death. too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life. fanda's wife for example; she's so worried about preparing for death, not in some religiously connotative way, but in a far too practical, even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile, laugh and just have a good time. her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto-pilot mode. fanda, to the contrary, is perhaps too blithe and absent-minded for his own good. he needs a person like his wife, emilie, to help balance him. <br /><br />it's as though fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child, like a kid trapped in an older man's body. he is introduced as the adventurous type; he pretends to be people he's not in order to get gain, squanders money, factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh. deep-down, though, he is a kind-hearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. the two off-set each other quite nicely, though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death: meaning, their divorce. it is during this courtroom scene that fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws, yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. in this moment of her forgiving him, fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. <br /><br />ironically, though, after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls, "a living corpse." the life-blood within him drains away as he becomes more like her
