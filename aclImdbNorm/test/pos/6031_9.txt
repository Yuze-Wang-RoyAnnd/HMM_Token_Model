i also saw the last stop at the moving pictures film festival in prince george. i have to confess, the only reason i went to see it is because i am a huge callum keith rennie fan. and he didn't let me down. he gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole movie.<br /><br />the movie itself is the usual 'lots of bad people trapped in a snow storm together' storyline, but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing. the characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well. the only problems i had with the cast was rose mcgowan. she was so cold throughout the movie that we didn't get any idea of her character's personality or motivations. other than her and a few small problems with continuity, this was a well-written, well acted thriller.
