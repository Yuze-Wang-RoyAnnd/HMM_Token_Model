a group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a halloween party. they get trapped inside, and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened. the possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by angela (mimi kinkade) who floats and talks in a really deep voice. the remaining teens that haven't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house.<br /><br />this is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include linnea quigley (who has a couple nude scenes as usual) gouging out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple. there's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out. this is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. the terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though. overall, i would give it a 7 out of 10.
