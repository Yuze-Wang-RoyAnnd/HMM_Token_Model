east side story entertains and informs about an unknown part of cold war history. what is the purpose of any documentary? to inform the reader through commentary and footage. this one succeeds at both. you will never find many movies whose clips you get to see in here because some of them have been destroyed and some are unaccessible.<br /><br />you get to see and her music from musicals made in east germany, russia, and other countries under soviet control. it shows you that the people who made these movies and the people who watched them all look for same things a westerner would look for, which are pretty women and men singing and dancing on the streets with smiles and (hopefully) white teeth.
