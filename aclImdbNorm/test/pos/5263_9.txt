most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head. viewers under "a certain age" and with iq's of three digits should avoid "chance of a lifetime" like a george w.bush appointee facing a congressional grilling.<br /><br />the cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a well-written script. is the premise wildly original? no, but the movie stands out like a lighthouse at midnight in the current and non-ending glut of movies/tv geared to the most-desirable audience demographic of teenagers and "young adults"<br /><br />in addition to betty white and leslie neilsen in the leads, the cast also has ever-reliable veterans like elaine stritch and william windom. the sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros.<br /><br />"chance of a lifetime" is definitely not a movie for the will ferrell/adam sandler/"saw" slasher gore-fests, "american eye dull," and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge ground out by hollywood and tv.
