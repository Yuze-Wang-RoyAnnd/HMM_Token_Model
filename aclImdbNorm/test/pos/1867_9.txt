simply put, paul bettany and jennifer connelly were remarkable. the movie is less about the raw science of darwin's beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, emma, and daughter, annie.<br /><br />toby jones gives a wonderful turn as thomas huxley, the great defender of darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with bettany and connelly.<br /><br />but it is those two who carry the movie. their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as darwin grapples with his demons. the scene where darwin relates the ending of the story of jenny, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, annie, is utterly gripping. the world premiere audience at the tiff was spellbound. bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the year's best in short order. equally magnificent is connelly's work playing the religious wife of a man who, in huxley's words, "killed god".<br /><br />the film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of darwin's grief, relishing every detail of bettany and connelly's acting.<br /><br />brilliant.
