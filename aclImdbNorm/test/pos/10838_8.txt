this drama apparently caused a bit of a stir six years ago when it debuted on television - not taking in much tv news myself, it passed under the radar; but after having seen it, i'm not surprised that it did cause a stir. not particularly because of the content (although it is a bit more 'offbeat' than the usual tv fodder) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. anyway, this three part series is based on a book by sarah waters and puts its main focus on lesbians - although the plot also has room to explore some other 'dark' sides of sexuality. our main character is an oyster girl named nan (short for nancy) from winchester. she is bewitched by female to male drag performer kitty butler after seeing her at a theatre show and soon begins attending all of her shows - eventually catching the eye of the performer and becoming her dresser. it's not long before kitty is offered a chance to play on bigger stages in london and having become good friends with nan, she invites her along for the ride. the act gets bigger when nan takes to the stage also and the pair becomes a stage duo...but kitty breaks nan's heart, leading her into an odyssey within london's seedy underbelly.<br /><br />i must admit that my dvd collection contains no shortage of sleazy and sordid films so there wasn't anything in this one that was enough to shock me. despite being rather jaded to it, i have to say that i'm still surprised at anyone who says this film went too far; naturally there is some lesbian sex and other stuff, but it's never exploitative or overused and the film really couldn't have been made without it. the main focus is always on the story; and the story is really well done. the film is almost three hours long in total, but if anything that isn't long enough to get everything across. sarah waters is obviously an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting for the duration. the acting is solid as you would expect, but i must admit that i found lead actress rachael stirling awkward and hard to get on with at first; although she grows into her role well as the film progresses. the execution is a little bit of a problem and director geoffrey sax is a bit too gimmicky for my liking. the story does get a little bit sappy towards the end also, which is a shame because this film is at it's strongest during the dark moments (episode 2 being the high point of three for me). there's not really a defined point to the film - or at least not one that i could see. that's not important as far as i'm concerned; however, as tipping the velvet tells a good story and more than surpassed my expectations. worth checking out, for people that like this sort of stuff.
