this film is one of my favorite christmas classics. sure, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing? no, this movie is definitely "a good thing" as martha stewart(appropriately)would say! barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly compliments her. both of them have charm and warmth to spare. they are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--sydney greenstreet, s.z.(cuddles)sakall, reginald gardiner and una o'connor among them. where are characters like this today? not one role could have been better cast. bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it. she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film. stanwyck was a strong actress, but had the wisdom to play this lightly. she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect. morgan is the essence of the nice guy. because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill. just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself, but he too is absolutely perfect as jefferson jones. skip the ill advised(and pointless)1992 remake and watch this bright, sparkling holiday gift!
