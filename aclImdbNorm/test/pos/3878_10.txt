due to this show getting cut early i never realized why until i recently read the story behind the series. i felt this show never got its dues as one of the greatest shows, this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always intended to have if not with the original a team cast at least with the cast incorporated into the story line or a lengthy cameo, perhaps at the end commemorate it to the late col. hanibal smith(preppard). this cast gave so much to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve one last heave ho the fact that the series ended openly because they slashed the series is reason enough. this crew and cast made us realize as children the essence of being one of the good guys especially seeing how screwed up the world is today, i think a milder version like the original should be put into motion i have already read the previews and i know these are not the plans but if anything a straight to dvd movie, i sure would buy it. i really do not get how crappy shows get series finales but this great show which still runs regularly today and probably gets watched more than some of the current garbage shows of today don't we will always remember the incredible hulk series, knight rider, airwolf, and the a team because those kind of shows carry through time, i am almost positive these knew ones you see about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years so why not bring back something and show the people what staying power is all about and how these old shows really are all about.
