i just watched the dvd version of born bad and found it to be tense, gritty and, near the end, too graphic for the faint of heart. justin walker (clueless) and corey feldman turn in superior performances. for a low budget film, this picture delivers. the depth of character and clever dialogue are two things not usually seen in a roger corman picture. check it out on dvd!
