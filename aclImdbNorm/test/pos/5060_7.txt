an arab american man is kidnapped from an american airport and flown to "somewhere in north africa" where he is tortured. the reason? his cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. the cia decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt or just a mistake. after watching this movie we can only but pray some terrorist doesn't accidentally punch in a wrong number!<br /><br />in addition to the rendition there are several related side stories. one involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?) who is torturing the suspect, and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers. this story is way too contrived, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see it's outcome. the director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience. <br /><br />the second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. she gets an old lover to help. he (a muted saarsgard) is aide de camp to a senator (alda) and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job isn't worth uncovering the truth. witherspoon is wasted in this role. all she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant, with one brief rage attack. streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt. (cia?nsa?homeland sec?) official who seems to be a cheney clone. <br /><br />gylenhall also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area he's over his head in, although he gets to do the "right thing" in the end.<br /><br />i found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject. it is certainly not to be viewed as definitive, and it certainly has an axe to grind. like "the kingdom" it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject.<br /><br />the movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition, but can only end up by being a "cautionary tale" about one botched one. the whole point of rendition is not to "torture" but to get "terror suspects" to give intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers. torture, for sure, may be employed, especially if the rendition is out of our hands - although we are obviously not guiltless in this matter - but intel that can save lives is vital in this "shadow war."
