instead of watching the recycled history of "pearl harbor" with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing but cgi explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle. one should go see dark blue world.<br /><br />this film takes place during the historic time in wwii which the czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the raf instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the nazis. it was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world. a love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die off conveniently like in pearl harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. the movie is tragedy after tragedy, with not even a bittersweet ending, with our hero not enjoying glory of taking his country back, the return of love by his current lover, the return of love by his reunited lover, or even the return of unconditional love by his life long pet. he is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the russian labor camp. this kind of ending is something that hollywood would probably change if it was their script.<br /><br />the movie does play on the sentimental sometimes, but it also shows the humanity of people. overall, a worthwhile movie.
