"caribe" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. however, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. the narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. the story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). the acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, esteban ram'irez. furthermore, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; so, once you become familiarized with them, you can perceive their feelings without them even saying anything. i can't say i liked this picture because of all the hype it generated(in costa rica), but rather because of the way it really achieves in showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the equilibrium of people's lives. hopefully, caribe will establish a reference for future projects in costa rica, as it is a very good example of nice movie making.
