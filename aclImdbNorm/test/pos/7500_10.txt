36. the hospital (comedy, 1971) a series of emergencies has gripped manhattan hospital. patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded conditions, and a ineptitude staff. when a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner, dr. bock (george c. scott), is called in to investigate. having worked as a doctor for too many years, and going through a mid-life crisis of his own, dr. bock finds the going tough. he decides to commit suicide. but then he meets barbara (diana rigg), a young-hippie beauty. whose keen insights on life help the depressed bock.<br /><br />critique: black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor george c. scott. he's good at playing high-strung, serious characters whose strict morals are severely tested. first half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and the shambles they sometimes are. but then, as things look set for a dramatic climax it skews into slapstick comedy. if paddy chayefsky's script had maintained its dramatic feel i wonder if scott would've walked out with another best actor oscar (he had previously won it, 'in-absentia', the year before). his breakdown (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history.<br /><br />quote: dr. bock: ". . .last night i sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide. i said 'no bock don't do it. you're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'. then. . .i find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses. . .how am i to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?"
