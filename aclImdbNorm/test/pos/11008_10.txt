yes!!!! fassbinder and ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! it's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than the matrix (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! very nice camera work by michael ballhaus and the wonderful "albatross" by fleetwood mac at the end. fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film. it's a shame this movie was never released on dvd. but now after 37 years they finally came to the conclusion, that this tv-movie, is not only one of the best fassbinder films (altough there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films), it's a brilliant example for a science-fiction movie, done without much money. buy it!! watch it!!
