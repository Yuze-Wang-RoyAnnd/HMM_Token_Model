"the gymnast" unfolds in short shots and short scenes, revealing its characters and message over time. the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like you're on a path of discovery as much as the characters are.<br /><br />the spare approach is also its drawback; there are a few scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context. there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials. i'm glad i did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well- rounded understanding of the film overall.<br /><br />aside from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies. the shooting was very tastefully done; very matter-of-fact. one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold, not a voyeuristic sleaze film. the physicality of the athletes -- their realness -- is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot.<br /><br />not a film i'll need to see again anytime soon, since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
