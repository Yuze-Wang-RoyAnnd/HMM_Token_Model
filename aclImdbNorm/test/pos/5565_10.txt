i have to tell you i've been a fan of star trek tng since i was a kid.<br /><br />well, sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some ds9 episodes and i asked him<br /><br />"hey man, what are you watching lately because i'm done watching all tng episodes" he said. "well, i got these episodes of farscape". i said: "ok, let me try it" i was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching tng and found it great."<br /><br />i had 3 episodes, viewed those but the show didn't impressed me very much, i found it childish initially and i thought its just another tv show, nice adventures but regular. music was a little bit different, neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the characters skin.<br /><br />i watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since. then the show started to get me, i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor crichton....the rest is history. <br /><br />i think i mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike star trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit. <br /><br />the show got better with each episode, very interesting story line.....what can i say, this movie its like poetry. <br /><br />i highly recommend it!!!
