when i was a child my grandmother took me to see this movie. and i fell in love with it. i admired dorothy dandridge so very much and wanted to be like her. i fell in love with sidney poitier. pearl bailey made me laugh. and sammy davis jr. was so great as sportin life. the music was just breath taken. when i had my first son and the movie came on tv i let him see it, and to this day he has never forgotten this movie. he loved it. i will always remember porgy and bess. it has a special place in my heart then and now. i really wish that they would restore this movie, because it was one of the greatest movies there has ever been with an all star "black cast".
