i'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (i'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline batman's either)<br /><br />a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the demolitionist. the black scorpion can be added to that collection.<br /><br />if you've seen the demolitionist then get this movie. it's basically a copy of that heroine. (it even stars the same guy in both movies)<br /><br />if you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance. she laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan severance) and goes out to kick some booty.<br /><br />it's a fun, action packed movie, mind you, you may not wish the kids to see it...without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene severance has in it. which in my opinion, was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)
