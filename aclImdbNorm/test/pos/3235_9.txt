don't watch this movie expecting the jane austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. this time around, the premise of northanger abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! <br /><br />in this version,catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. by day she is very prim and demure, and her swain henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. but as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid! <br /><br />at the beginning of the story, catherine's visions of sex are based entirely on the gothic novels she devours in bed. it is both heartwarming, sexy, and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome henry "dissolves" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains! at the same time, it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head! <br /><br />later, after being invited to henry's castle, catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning. jumping into bed, she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully, her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert. little by little, however, those pretty blue eyes droop and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire. this time, catherine dreams she is in elizabethan times, waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the "banditi!" it's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits. she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation! but then, after a shot of her running frantically to escape, we are back to the daylight world, where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep. it's worth noting that catherine's heavy-eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been! <br /><br />ultimately, of course, catherine's stern and unimaginative lover henry divines the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture. it's interesting that catherine's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships. in the next scene, she tearfully burns her gothic romance and throws herself shamefaced and sobbing onto the bed. significantly, this turning point is also marked by catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time, there are no dreams of make believe passion. presumably, catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing.<br /><br />though katherine schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull. i'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level.<br /><br />if you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real gothic setting, i highly recommend the perilous gard by elizabeth marie pope.
