this film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at cinequest in the big california theatre in san jose. it's a musical, which normally i don't like, but i have to say this one was different. robert peters, who directed the film and stared in it, did such a wonderful job. during his q & a he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in germany! i can't say enough great things about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera work and it shakes a bit. if you happen to come across this film- check it out!
