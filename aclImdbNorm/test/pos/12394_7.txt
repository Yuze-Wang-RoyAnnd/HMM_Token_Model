i blow hot and cold over carn'e. he really can be a puzzle for me. i think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation. certainly a man who came to maturity in the thirties with the popular front seems ill at ease in the france of the fifties, with its rampant commercialism and heavy american influence. he is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. the party scenes go on much longer than they should, as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. roland lesaffre's character--he plays pascale petit's older brother--seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-style ideas are still sound.<br /><br />at two hours, this picture is far too long. still, let me praise pascale petit for her game performance; she was a natural who should have challenged brigitte bardot for sexpot supremacy, but somehow lost her way. andrea parisy is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought that way in the fifties). laurent terzieff is the only french actor who could play an anarchist convincingly: he is great here as he rescues a cat from death, then remarks he can't stand cats. jacques charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant little grin and those blank eyes.
