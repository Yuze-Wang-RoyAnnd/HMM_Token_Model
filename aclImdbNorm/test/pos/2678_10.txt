wow,this is in my opinion the best sitcom since friends. if you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer (if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do.) and watch a couple of episodes,it's the perfect recipe for happiness.<br /><br />the thing i like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing. after a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. i think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life. doug is fat but still happy with it,he loves his wife his job and his friends. the father in law is the fly in the ointment but hey nothings perfect.
