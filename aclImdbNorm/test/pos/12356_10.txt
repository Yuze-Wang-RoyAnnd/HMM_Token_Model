yeah, i guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of pam grier's other films. the plot is overly familiar, the dialog stilted, and some of the acting isn't too good. but it's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film, where we see ms grier in a sexy blue wetsuit, with the zipper half unzipped. yeah, it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of pam grier's talent, but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman, and back in the day, she had a body that wouldn't quit. it's nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit. rent the dvd, and then tell me i'm wrong. can't, can you? that's because you know i'm right! :-) and yes, i really did give a 10 just for the wetsuit scenes! ;-)
