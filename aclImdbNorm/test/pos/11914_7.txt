toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying american counter-terrorist forces accurately. just check out the end credits--there are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed. the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us army's delta force (who are unnamed in the movie as the pentagon was still denying their existence at this time) once the president waived the posse commitatus act of us code. the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time. and even the use of an ah-64 apache for air support--which might seem a bit over the top, is not terribly unrealistic. far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counter-terrorist forces with far less accuracy.
