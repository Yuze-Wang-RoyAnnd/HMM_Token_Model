this film took me by surprise. i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 7.8, rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! if anything, they underrated this little gem.<br /><br />filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother mina, and less than forthcoming dad, mike. i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (mike & mina's son doug) was going to take us. as a matter of fact, i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this!<br /><br />life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. "51 birch street" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. bravo!!!!!!!!
