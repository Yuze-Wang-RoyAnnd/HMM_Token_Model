idiocracy felt like mike judge took my thoughts on society and put them into film. in fact, the movie is a social commentary. almost feels like a documentary at times. luke wilson did a good job playing a boring average joe (like in most of his movies).<br /><br />of course idiocracy was an extreme of the current state of society. but that's what makes most comedies funny, a extreme of any situation. fiction isn't that much different then reality.<br /><br />with kids praising materialist hip-hop culture and taking pride in being ignorant. when people feel useless in life, they breed. giving them a purpose in the world. and it seems only the worse people breed the most. i can understand how others don't like it. it doesn't help most of the jokes were 2nd grade bathroom humor. not much different than a kevin smith film.<br /><br />idiocracy throws away logic, reason, any intelligence (for good reason).<br /><br />mike judges comeback was a knockout.
