this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is. what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th, a life style that made people dream of the 'new' world of america. the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet, just a stone cottage set amid the harsh, unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass. an opening sequence sees the mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside, stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a 'sign' that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are. it further shows life aboard the liner, huddled masses indeed, yearning to breathe free, and conditions in ellis island where, their journey still not over, they are interrogated and examined to prove their 'fitness' to enter america. what is not shown is the ship in longshot, or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large, ocean-going liner; what is also not shown is anything that would identify america, no clich'e view of new york harbour and the statue of liberty, so that ellis island could be anywhere in any country. perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together; slowly, almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful statement of society being fragmented. there's a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical families/conditions at the time. with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it's not for the popcorn brigade at the multiplex but for the rest of us it's a very fine film indeed.
