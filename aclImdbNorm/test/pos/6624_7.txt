after watching ingmar bergman's skammen, i had many feelings, but most notably, i felt unsatisfied. i have heard so much hype about this movie but i came to find it lacking. don't get me wrong, i can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but as far as depth and emotion, i was not so impressed. i found the characters to be disagreeable and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. in addition, the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real. dramatic war movies, in my opinion, are much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. i find that of all the movies that try to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as effectiveness.
