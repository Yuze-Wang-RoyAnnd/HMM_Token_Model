every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. the dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. for example, the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (i forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the gilmore family dinner into all-out war. and these were just the few seconds or so.<br /><br />so it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content. the scripts they use must be enormous.<br /><br />but then every once in a while something happens. the babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent, emotional moments. for example, this week it was lorelai's breakdown at the estate agent's. i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long while.<br /><br />almost makes everything worthwhile.
