guest from the future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, battle of good and evil -- all with a small budget, child actors, and few special effects. something for spielberg and lucas to learn from. ;) a sixth-grader kolya "nick" gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. he discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. the device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. when two evil space pirates from saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy nick. with the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and alice. chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. alice enrolls in the same school nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in pe class. the catch is, alice doesn't know what nick looks like, while the pirates do. also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (hmm, i wonder if this is where james cameron got the idea for terminator...) who gets to nick -- and mielophone -- first? excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. i wish hollywood made kid movies like this one...
