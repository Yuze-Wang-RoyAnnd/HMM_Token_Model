james bridges' "the china syndrome" is a first rate thriller; a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller but don't know how.<br /><br />most thrillers end with the standard shoot-em-up and chase that ends with the villain getting what he/she deserves. but bridges understands that such a standard finale isn't the case in some scenarios. "the china syndrome" is thrilling in a way no one would expect. it has the type of ending that's so unexpected, but yet so logical.<br /><br />the film stars three (then) current oscar winners: jack lemmon (best actor 1973 for "save the tiger"), jane fonda (best actress 1971 and 1978 for "klute" and "coming home" respectively) and michael douglas (best picture 1975 for producing "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". this isn't your standard "spot the star" flick that became so popular in the 70s. the acting is so solid and strong that we forget who's playing the roles and believe that the characters are real people. that's a testament to the collective ablities of all three actors. they may be stars, but they're actors first.<br /><br />there is no music score in the film. asides from a few background songs from jukeboxes or tv shows, there is nothing. bridges doesn't allow any directorial style to come through on screen. he is simply presenting the material straightforward. with a strong dramatic story like this, we don't need a score to distract us. it kind of strikes me as a predecessor to the dogma 95 filmseries started by lars von trier in 1997. it focuses on the characters and story rather than style.<br /><br />the story is about a nuclear power plant located in southern california. **spoiler** an accident appears to have happened and basically the film is about lemmon,fonda and douglas try to expose the truth. in a way this is not a spoiler, since the trailer, tv spots, video boxes and reviews all give this away. but from this seemingly simple premise, a surprisingly complex morality play springs and the suspense comes from human nature and the actions of people rather than a villain framing another guy (although this is an element in the film). that's what makes "the china syndrome" so good.<br /><br />**** out of 4 stars
