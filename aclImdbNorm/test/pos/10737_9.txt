i consider myself lucky that i got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors. "kramer vs. kramer" was great to me because i think i could relate to it.<br /><br />unfortunately, my parents are divorced. even though i was older than billy in this movie, i felt his pain and confusion. having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst. through this movie, actually, i think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had as just much pain as my sister and i had.<br /><br />back to the movie, this was a good one. yes, it's dated and meryl and dustin are very young. but i would recommend this for a lot of people, because i think most can relate in some way. there are funny, sad, happy, and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors. it's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5.<br /><br />9/10
