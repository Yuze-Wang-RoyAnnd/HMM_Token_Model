i read the above comment and cannot believe it! of course its a children's movie, its an adaptation of a children's book!! this film is easy to get a hold of, try play.com or amazon and its very easy to gain a copy! the jokes are hilarious for kids and adults alike, and the adventure is clean with no violence! its completely suitable for children of all ages! the songs are fab, and yes, a little repetitive but thats what children need and whilst watching it my little ones were heard singing "hi hi cocalorum" all night! they loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! very lovely and well worth watching for kids and adults of all ages!
