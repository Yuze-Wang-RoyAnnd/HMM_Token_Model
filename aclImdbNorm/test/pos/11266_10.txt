i purchased this video on vcr tape in a good-will store for us 50 cents. i have taken quite a few videos i purchased back for them to sell to others after i viewed them considering the 50 cent cost as a rental. this is the only one that will never go back. it is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. i don't know if i should calls it circus, dance, or both. it is bigger than life itself. they will only be able to do this well for just a few brief years in their life. these are the performers for the performers. if gene kelly and burt lancaster were alive today and saw them live they would be awe-struck. i would lend it to others to watch but i know if i do that i will never get it back.
