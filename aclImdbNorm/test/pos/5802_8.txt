i have to admit that when first saw madonna performing holiday on top of the pops many years ago i said to my wife "another american one hit wonder getting the whole thing wrong!!" well she was wearing a fright wig and was appallingly dressed. i have never grown to love her the way my daughter does but i have to eat my words. i do like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. this confessions tour film is great,even if the music is not(and its not). i was impressed by the staging and concepts. madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her. my daughter was at the london gigs and was crazy about it. the lady (madge) has proved my initial assessment of her so very wrong!!
