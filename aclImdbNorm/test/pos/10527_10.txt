great adaptation of the christie novel. surprising attention to authentic period details for the time (many films of the mid-1970s-early 80s that try to do 1920s-early 30s look far too mid-70s-early 80s for my liking, so expected the worst here, and was gladly proved wrong)the costumes and sets are very well done. i liked this production very much
