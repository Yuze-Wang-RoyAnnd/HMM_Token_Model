blind spot's images are great. the action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. by the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. the lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. the story is heart-wrenching. the film score is nicely understated . completely moving in its own powerful way. not your standard melodramatic cuing. trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. hope you get a chance to see this film. it delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.
