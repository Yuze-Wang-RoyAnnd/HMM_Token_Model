i'll be brief: i normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.<br /><br />but what are they? well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind. the three main stars (whalin, johnson, long) put in fairly decent performances that more than make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast (the fat cop and coach quinn really bugged me), and the scripting is slick and witty (even if it is poor in places).<br /><br />the bottom line is, though, this film is so cute: i grinned all the way through it and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer up anybody. you really have to be some kind of humourless bore not to like this (i dare somebody to sit through this without grinning!!!).<br /><br />i do recommend this one if you want a simple, fun, and - above all - enjoyable watch. you won't regret it!<br /><br />~top$~
