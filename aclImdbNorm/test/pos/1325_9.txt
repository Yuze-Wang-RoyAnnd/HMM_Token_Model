the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. that's the season i give the high rating to! (true, there are still a lot of "liberties" taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable.)<br /><br />the subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of melrose place meets top gun! <br /><br />i was a marine stationed at miramar at the time and i remember them shooting the show around the san diego area. i got to talk to rod rowland and james brolin.<br /><br />rowland's character was good to go.<br /><br />brolin's character was good in the first season only. for some reason he slacked off after the first ep of the second season.<br /><br />if you want to see a little of how the marine air ground team operates, then season one is the one to watch.<br /><br />if you're into melrose place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into top gun, then see the last two seasons.
