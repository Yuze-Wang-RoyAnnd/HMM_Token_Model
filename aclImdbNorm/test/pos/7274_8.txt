ah, how refreshing to see a vision of 18th century england complete with mud, the pox and gibbets... and accompanied by a delightful techno soundtrack to boot. this is the story of downtrodden highwayman plunkett (robert carlisle) and gentleman-fallen-on-hard-times captain macleane (jonny lee miller), and how they get together and rob the aristo pigs. plunkett is a hard nut, but macleane is far too polite for that, and thus becomes 'the gentleman highwayman'. he falls in love with lady rebecca (liv tyler), (who to be frank is the only weak part of the whole shebang) and wants to impress her.<br /><br /> the costumes are fantastic. big, colourful, historically innacurate beautiful togs. alan cummings gets all the best threads, and the best lines as lord rochester, sporting a very non-18th century eyebrow piercing. the music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and thumping bass-laden techno, which doesn't jarr as you think it should do in a historical film. the script is fast-moving and peppered with modern-day colloquialisms; merchant ivory, this is not. there are hilarious parts, disgusting parts, sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-and-nibble-your-fingernails parts, but the whole thing chugs along and is wonderfully entertaining throughout. this is cheer-in-the-cinema stuff. unmissable.
