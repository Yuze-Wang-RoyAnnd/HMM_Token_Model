"journey to the far side of the sun" (aka "doppelganger") is an entertaining, twilight zone-style sci-fi offering from gerry and sylvia anderson (the team behind space: 1999, ufo, thunderbirds, fireball xl-5 and others). in the film, roy thinnes (of the "invaders" tv show) and ian hendry star as astronauts sent on a flight to a planet which shares an exact orbit of the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun; hence previously hidden from view. a pushy european space flight director (over-acted by the late patrick wymark) gets the flight fast-tracked and after rigorous training , the astronauts are good to go. thus begins the best sequences in the film, the launch, flight and landing on the 'other' earth. dazzling rocket miniature work (by derek meddings) and a dream-like, elegant spaceflight (somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: a space odyssey") are easy highlights of the movie. the landing on the "doppelganger" earth is both exciting and eerie. after this, the twilight zone aspect of the film kicks in; with a plot lifted almost whole from the classic tz episode, "the parallel." that aside, the film is still solid sci-fi, with some intriguing 'mirror-world' stuff to chew on (backwards writing and left-handed handshakes, for example). less successful are the scenes depicting a mid-21st century earth; where all the men wear turtlenecks and nehru jackets and all the women wear mini-skirts. some of the relationships with women in the film are very 'non-pc' by today's standards as well. and (in the most consistent failing of most 20th century sci-fi) the computers, telephones and other hardware are all big, colorful and clunky (right out of patrick mcgoohan's "the prisoner"). no one foresaw the digital microprocessor age! if one can accept these failings in foresight, the movie is very interesting, with a solid lead performance by thinnes as the troubled astronaut. and with a nice, 1960s/early '70s style nihilistic ending! for fans of retro sci-fi (like myself) this is a "journey" worth taking!
