a very suspenseful giallo from the director of "l'anticristo"(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.however the main story is about maniac(david warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.the plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.the score by francesco de massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in lucio fulci's "the new york ripper"(1982).highly recommended for fans of italian cinema!
