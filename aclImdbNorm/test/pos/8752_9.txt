i enjoyed this programme immensely. it is exceptionally well written, with finely judged performances and clever visuals.<br /><br />it is also very frank and honest, refreshing compared to the sanitised representation of drug use in films and television.<br /><br />unmissable - one of the finest television shows of recent years, and triumph on all scales for channel 4.<br /><br />9/10
