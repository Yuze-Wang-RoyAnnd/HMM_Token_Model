although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parent's high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is way outdated)... and i admit that that was my first impression.... but honestly,the 'lessons' that are learned by the heroes/heroines are def. not outdated. who doesn't want to be famous? and who doesn't want do be accepted my their peers? and the homosexual guy-isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? this movie, though released in the 80's still addresses some of the biggest issues in today's world. this movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste, though. (thus the 8/10 rating)
