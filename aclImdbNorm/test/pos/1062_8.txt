given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (casper gutman, signior ferrari, mr. peters, jerome k. arbutny, ex-superintendent grodman, count fosco, titus semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally sidney greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the west end and broadway. he was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. in fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner peter lorre in a cameo appearance). his best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher alexander yardley in "christmas in connecticut" (although his autocratic, half-mad soap tycoon in "the hucksters" is a close second). despite some problems with the screenplay, it is a good film, and usually revived in the christmas season.<br /><br />elizabeth lane (barbara stanwyck) writes a column in "american housekeeping" magazine for yardley, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. she is the 1945 version of martha steward, except that ms steward is a cook and house-owner, and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates. stanwyck can't. her cooking recipes are those of her friend felix (s.z. sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur. the house she describes as her home (a model farmhouse in connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, architect john sloan (reginald gardiner). gardiner really would not mind marrying stanwyck, but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him.<br /><br />as the film begins, an american is shipwrecked by the nazis. this is jefferson jones (dennis morgan), a sailor. he spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued. sensing publicity value, greenstreet decides to grant morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned christmas in connecticut. he basically tells stanwyck that she will entertain morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays. stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself (complete with her ability to flip flap-jacks, and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does she will be fired, as will her immediate boss dudley beecham (robert shayne). in a moment of depression she accepts gardiner's proposal of marriage, and then gardiner finds his connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the "actual" home of stanwyck and himself and "their baby".<br /><br />of course, aside from putting off greenstreet's meddling curiosity, stanwyck and morgan find that they are falling in love (much to the annoyance of gardiner - he does actually expect that stanwyck will still marry him). complication following complication occurs, as lies piles on lies, and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies, before greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. but it is a comedy, so everything works out well. even greenstreet, at the conclusion, is amused by the entire madness - his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of santa clause for a change. this is not a classic comedy, certainly not a great one, but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in december.
