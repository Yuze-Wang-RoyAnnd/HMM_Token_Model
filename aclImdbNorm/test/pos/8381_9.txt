i have been feeling a little disappointed by tarantino ever since death proof. but i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. inglorious basterds has definitely propelled tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. this movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word : "raw". <br /><br />there is an intense emotion in every scene. revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, from the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the nazis, and is placed in tarantino's fictional dimension of the ww2 historical context. <br /><br />characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. i won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances. <br /><br />dialogue has evolved from the classic tarantino "bad ass" provocative style as seen in pulp fiction and death proof. one can feel in the dialogues that tarantino is making more open references to other movies. indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner. <br /><br />it is nice to see that each language presented (german, french, and english) is employed rather equally and naturally. i speak both french and english very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how english speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in english/american movies act poorly. amazingly enough, tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. it helps put the audience in context of the historical context. indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers/spies/civilians from other countries.<br /><br />the visuals/photography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s wwii europe. the outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmically/realistically conveyed. no punches are held back, and the nazis are often shown being tortured. this makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. <br /><br />volumes can be written about this movie. but the movie is so good, that during the north american inglorious basterds premiere at the fantasia festival in montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. i hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please.
