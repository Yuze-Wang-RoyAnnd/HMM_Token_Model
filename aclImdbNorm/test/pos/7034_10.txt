i have been waiting to see this film for ages and i finally have! as soon as i heard the title i knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when i saw it believe me i wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />this film had everything dance, love and patrick swayze! there was so much in it and it dealt with important issues, (that were at the time, 1960's) , such as abortion.<br /><br />the dancing in this film was fantastic, just like the acting was! swayze was brilliant just like grey was too!<br /><br />although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene. it really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing!<br /><br />overall dirty dancing is a film not to be missed and even if half the actors are in the: "where are they now?" period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!
