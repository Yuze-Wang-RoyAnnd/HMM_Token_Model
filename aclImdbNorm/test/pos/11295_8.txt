i was surfing through imdb one day, when i stumbled across "the curious adventures of mr. wonderbird." noticing how obscure it was, i decided to set off looking for it. thanks to digiview, it didn't take me long, so i bought it for a dollar, and when i got home, i watched it, although i must say, i was quite impressed.<br /><br />three of the paintings in a king's apartment, a shepherdess, a chimney sweep, and a self-portrait of the king (who is just as selfish and sadistic as the actual king himself) come to life one night while the king is sleeping. the shepherdess and the chimney sweep escape, while the painting of the king calls the police in order to capture the couple. fortunately for the couple, mr. wonderbird comes in to help them, often mocking the police and the king.<br /><br />the back of the dvd case describes this film as "a surreal visual delight and an underrated entry in the history of classic animation." i couldn't agree more with it, considering that much of the backgrounds look rather bizarre, and many of the characters are weird, which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions that are calmed by the music of a blind man (who kind of looks like andy warhol), not to mention mr. wonderbird himself is somewhat eccentric. the film is very creative and mostly fun to watch, and its only flaw is that it can be slow moving. but overall, this film was very good, and it comes recommended by yours truly.<br /><br />grade: b+ (awesome)
