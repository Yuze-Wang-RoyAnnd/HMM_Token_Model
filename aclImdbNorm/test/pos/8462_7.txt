saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later. i'm watching it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. does it wreak of "lifetime movie network"? yes, but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed somehwere to air.<br /><br />the cast was excellent. the story was a little schmaltzy; two women become close friends and unbeknownst to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband. she's invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. she is horrified and tries to break off the affair. shortly afterwards he is tragically killed in a car accident which is devatating for both women. of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now, but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other.<br /><br />i thought it was a very good story a great cast and perfomrances. i really enjoyed it.
