a chick flick that guys still like - yes! wonderful. now i can have fun, enjoy the company of my girl, and not feel like i can't wait until the movie ends! light - but funny. great stuff. what ever you do don't miss the dvd extras. this a great "blind date" file too. will smith does well in this - even though in is light acting - he pulls trough it all well. the movie is a little slow in pacing - don't expect too much action - the laughs are there - and so is the message - but the timing is a little slow. use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. the ending makes the feel good moments worth it. most of all expect fun light hearted fare - and watch for some great upstaging by the supporting actors - they make the film. the plot twists are predictable - but it is a date move, so get the refills of popcorn from the kitchen - and don't make her pause it. count on more dates after this movie - she'll want o see what is next in line. remember hitch's advice!!! <br /><br />enjoy.
