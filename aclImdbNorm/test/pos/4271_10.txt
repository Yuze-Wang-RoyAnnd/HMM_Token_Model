i saw this film at a small screening. even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. it's april 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their "mid 20's" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of nirvana singer kurt cobain's suicide. they quickly get inspiration to travel from san francisco to seattle and attend the cobain vigil. it's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes. highlights include: a visit to jimi hendirx's grave, kurt cobain's original childhood home and a campfire sing along. an honest an original piece of work.
