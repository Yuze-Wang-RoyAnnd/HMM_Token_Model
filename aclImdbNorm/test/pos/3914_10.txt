people are stupid.you shouldn't cheer when paris gets killed in the head with a pipe! it is plain rude!what did paris do to you? what if that was you? you wouldn't want people cheering for your death!anyway it was really gory, which i liked and it was cool when elisha's finger gets cut off.it was weird with that twist that they didn't have 2 sons they had tree and all, it makes way for a house of wax 2: ressurction or something.paris was great acting in the chase scene.elisha and chad chemistry is great, they deserve an oscar.my friends and i were cracking up when that guy said that's hot when paris and the guy from cousin skeeter making out.lol.k bye.
