-that's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film. i just saw this baby at the munich film festival and it rocked the house. director doug pray is never seen in this documentary, nor i think he is even heard, but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the "mixer." he has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about. i was never big into "scratching" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and infusing in-jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. mix master mike from the beastie boys is in this film, but it wasn't until after the film that i could name several heavy hitters in the industry (dj shadow, q- bert, etc). the extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky djs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. the film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. pray doesn't let his film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re-energized by hardly ever ceasing music. if nothing else, this film will increase your slang vocabulary. i have to get back to "digging", so i'll end this review. see it, it will be of interest. good stuff man. good stuff.
