night of the demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good low-budget can be. sure, much of it is fairly predictable, but somehow it's still much more enjoyable than the crap we see these days being passed off as "horror". i give the gore a solid 9, and the demons' one-liners are actually funny. i'm still creeped out by "stop looking at me!" the soundtrack is well done, i was surprised to hear "stigmata martyr" from bauhaus! there is also some very nice t&a on display, as well as some hella good make-up effects. the second film in the series is pretty good too, but avoid the inferior third one. night of the demons may be dated, dark, and low-rent, but it still has a lot of potential. it's definitely worth a rental at least. give it a chance tonight, just stay away from any old makeup! (you'll understand when you see it!)
