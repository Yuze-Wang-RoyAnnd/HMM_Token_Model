following the business coup of the year of 1941, max and dave, the brothers fleischer were removed from their own studio by paramount pictures corporation. former employees such as seymour kneitel and izzy sparber were put in charge of the new operation, now renamed famous studios by paramount. early on, the finished product of famous was indiscernible from that of the recent output by fleischer. the existing series (popeye, superman) continued as if nothing at all had transpired.<br /><br />today's subject, japoteurs is one of the earlier famous studio's superman shorts.<br /><br />as had been the custom, the superman cartoons were a great combination of fine, fittingly fashioned music in the score. that goes for the theme (overture) as well as all the multi-mood background (incidental) music. it was if each cartoon short had its own background music, as all was kept fresh by apparently recording it anew with each picture.<br /><br />with regards to japoteurs, we must remember that this was filmed during the first year of the united states' involvement and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotypical, short-handed and outright evil. the dialogue and personality of the villainous japanese saboteurs was strictly from the stock characters of the old pulp magazine stories, with their every word being said in a sarcastic, totally insincere politeness as the characters would flaunt their cold bloodedness as they made the most demonic of threats and outrageous acts toward the occidental world.<br /><br />japoteurs is visually bright and uplifting, stunningly laid out and makes use of some multi plane or table top animation in order to give its flying sequences a real depth.<br /><br />making good use of the tie-ins between the animated cartoons, the superman radio show then heard over the mutual broadcasting network; the cartoon bears a close resemblance to the comics page and uses the very same talents of voice actors bud collyer and joan alexander from the radio show.<br /><br />we rate it with a ***  1/2  stars.<br /><br />poodle schnitz!!
