wow! fantastic film in my opinion, i wasn't expecting it to be this good! i was captivated from start to finish- it's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world, chronicling his life as he writes "origin of the species"; fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so. he struggles hard with his mind, body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip away...whilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives, culture and meaning of existence. it's a subtle movie (not over-exaggerated in any way in that typical hollywood way, this is a bbc produced british film) yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by bettany. connelly acts as more of a light supporting role but i did enjoy her in this and she's as good as to be expected as always, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing, you could feel the connection, and their real-life husband/wife bond definitely shines through their performances. but the star of the show is definitely bettany and he does a brilliant job, a very touching performance- i both understood and sympathised with him as he battled his own degrading health and impending "insanity" to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking contradict his feelings, and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict christian whilst he was in the realm of science, two worlds which could not see eye to eye, so their relationship was at stake too.<br /><br />anyway- a really very good, well acted emotional drama and dare i say i did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving. the film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well, in fact i can't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed. easily one of the best films i've seen this year.
