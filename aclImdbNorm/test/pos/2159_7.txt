night hunter is a sold b style action movie. get a life and grow up people. don "the dragon" wilson is a kick boxer, (hall of fame) and not an actor. if your looking for an oscar, it's not here brother. looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget, this is it.the plot line may have been a little thin, but what b movie isn't. i understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure. get real people, judging every movie like it is an oscar contender, just silly. awesome fight scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. see it if your a fan, rent something else if your a hater.
