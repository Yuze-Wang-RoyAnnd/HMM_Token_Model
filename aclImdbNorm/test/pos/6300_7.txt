the movie is a really well made one, which is great and looking and passionately directed. you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection. for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it.<br /><br />it's hard to place this movie under one label. it's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. instead its more a movie with its own style, that does things its own way. it doesn't necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combined.<br /><br />but just like the movie its main character, the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts. the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and it's more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie. it doesn't make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute must-see. in parts the movie also feels as if it's trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself. it just feels a bit overdone in parts, though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifully.<br /><br />it features some great camera-work and some unique storytelling, which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch.<br /><br />7/10
