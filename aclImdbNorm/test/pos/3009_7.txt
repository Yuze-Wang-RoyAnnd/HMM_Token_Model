i couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. i am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. there are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that i see this movie, i find something new that i had not seen before. as with previous movies that i have seen, such as blade and mystery men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well. though the characters could have been developed better, the action and costuming was well worth the price of admission. i recommend you buy this one for your dvd collection. even if you haven't seen this on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. i know i wasn't.
