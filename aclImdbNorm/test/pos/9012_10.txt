i've never been compelled to write a review about anything, but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. first, people just have to get over the fact that the voices are different. once you watch an episode, it never really comes to mind ever again. the humor is original and while, yes, some jokes do carry over from the movie, they are delivered fresh. some of it is even reminiscent of shrek--self-referential humor. a lot of these jokes seem aimed at teens or original fans of the movie as much as tweens and younger. patrick warburton and eartha kitt are both hilarious as they reprise their roles as kronk and yzma and their annie award nominations were well-warranted.<br /><br />this show takes some time to love, to really get in "the groove" of things, so to speak. if you ignore the horrible theme song (which really shouldn't warrant that much in the way of how you judge a show since it's only 30 seconds of the overall product), this show is laugh-out-loud hilarity and doesn't lose any of the emperor's new groove spirit.
