okay, that was just brilliant. i wish that the rest of season 1 had been this strong. it really needed more episodes like this. <br /><br />the cast worked perfectly, even though they were all nobodies back in the day. writing was fantastic and so was the editing. great job in all accounts. <br /><br />the episode was thrilling, suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end. which is what most motw episodes had tried, but failed until now. <br /><br />the first five star episode for me. really good, almost like a movie. i didn't even remember it being this good. i think it's even better than the great horror movie called 'the thing'.
