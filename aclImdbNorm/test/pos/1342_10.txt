i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was four-years-old. i had half-day kindergarten and this was on wpix channel 11 in the afternoon. i just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing.<br /><br />i just saw part of an episode on youtube and for a moment i could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child. i, of course, stopped watching when i got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out (no vcr's or dvr's back then). i grew up, not realizing that the show was still on until i was in 11th grade! <br /><br />i also had no idea that there are dvd's and wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this show, but now they're all past the demographic, or i'd buy all of them dvd sets. this was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today.
