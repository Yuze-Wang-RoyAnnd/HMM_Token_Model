one of the finest movies i have viewed...good script, original plot of a man who is haunted about jfk's assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that cold november day in 1963. thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. the secret service agent loses his partner along the way,to the crazed gunmen who schemes,lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission. <br /><br />the movie accompanies with a great memorable score,and a restrained but meaningful romance between russo and eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. malchovich is great,sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played,but how many could acted with such craftiness,and intellect that he displayed in the movie?<br /><br />needless to say,i thought this was a great movie...everytime it's on television i have to watch it..and i own it on dvd! i'm a big eastwood fan,this only boosted his already fabulous career,and malchovich's best role to date!<br /><br />
