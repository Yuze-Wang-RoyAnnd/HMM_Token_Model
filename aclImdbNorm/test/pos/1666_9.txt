i heard they were going to remake this french classic in 2007, and i see it is in development for 2011. this will be a shame, as hollywood kicked writer/director jules dassin out because of the infamous blacklist. they should not have the right to remake any of his films.<br /><br />i love "caper" films and "film noir," and this combines the best of both.<br /><br />tony (jean servais) gets out after doing a nickle, and after he beats up his old girlfriend (marie sabouret), he plans a big score with his friends mario (robert manuel) and jo (carl m"ohner), what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery. you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas capers. nothing is left to chance.<br /><br />the caper goes off great but grutter (marcel lupovici) sends his sons, robert hossein and pierre grasset after tony and the gang. after blowing it with mario, they kidnap jo's son. lots of bullets fly before it is over.<br /><br />a great film by a great director. the standard by which other caper films are measured.
