the most vivid portrait of small-town oddity i've seen in a long time -and i'm not just talking about australian films. this piece of work seems to have been made "under the radar" and really, it's an entirely fascinating piece of work, that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent aust. film making.<br /><br />at times it is rather slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head-movie'. but the stunning aspect of the film by alex frayne is its iron fisted, ruthless direction. it never wavers, it is highly controlled, precise and absolutely self-assured. the cinematography is some of the most artful, beautiful and lyrical i've seen. the sound is all psychological, the music builds the tension.<br /><br />by the third act, the story is ramped up and episodes collide and converge - don't attempt to piece together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes, it's a bit of an impost - but by that time the film has you a bit of a trance, a sort of hypnosis, and you've been sold a riddle - that has no real answer.
