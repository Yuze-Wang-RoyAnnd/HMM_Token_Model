i like money! i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week. wasn't sure what to expect. brought it home, set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began. the first viewing i did a lot of chuckling, no laughing out loud really. it wasn't until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier. it reminded me of austin powers, first viewing it was all right, then the real fun began telling people about it, just talking about each scene and the set up. i'm making all my friends watch this movie, everyone i know. this movie may very well be one of the most accurate "future" movies ever made. this movie is more then just 84 minutes of entertainment, it's a warning to the future of our civilization. mike judge, the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the automated future. luke wilson's dead pan humor as "average" joe enhanced the movie that much more. watch this movie then once you're done, read more! write more! think more! for the futures sake if not for your own!
