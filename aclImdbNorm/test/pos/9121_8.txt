i love a film that mixes edge-of-the-seat suspense, laughs, style, good acting, and a bit of self-parody. hitchcock consistently carried this off, and in "le cercle rouge" jean-pierre melville does the same. i was sorry when this long film ended. <br /><br />i agree with the english commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic. i love french films, italian films, english films, indian films--and the increasingly rare good american films. i also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an american gangster film, missed the point completely. but i guess it's like jazz: either you get it, or you don't, so why waste time trying to explain.<br /><br />just see "le cercle noir" and be prepared to be deliciously entertained.
