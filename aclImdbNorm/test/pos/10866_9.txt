here we've got an intelligent mixture of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and intelligent filmmaking. not that the script has not its big holes and a few specialeffects are a bit cheaplooking. but the cinematography is a optical treat and the soundtrack is first rate. the blend of fast actionsequences and colorful slow, sometimes nearly poetic parts, has no comparison in its kind of movie, so a classification is rather hard. the closest genre is a disaster or terroristmovie with deeper human and political notes than usual. well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas. but i am hoping this for so many other (mostly asian) movies before and nobody seems to believe me. unfortunately.
