mike nichols in finest form. i was not a fan of "closer", so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but nichols and his very strong a-list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling congressman.<br /><br />philip seymour hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here playing a damaged but ultra-smart cia manipulator, and it is in the exchanges between hanks and hoffman's characters where the comedy soars. rarely is movie humour laugh-out loud and also smart... this hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world (often simultaneously).<br /><br />one other major plus is the length of the picture. the film is based on george crile's fat book of the same title. the temptation for screenwriter aaron sorkin (his claim to fame is "the west wing") must have been to make a fat movie, but what we get is a breath-taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications.<br /><br />this film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script - even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that herring and wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11).
