i don't know if it's fair for me to review this. i'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. i've never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers. when the godfather came out, i thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have produced a series of well-acted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them. this one is obviously low-budget, but it is certainly well done. at some point in all of these i feel like i want to take a shower. if such characters actually exist, it is hard for the soul. i always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing. this kind of crud has to be stopped. i hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. i feel sort of the same way about slasher movies. why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment? in fairness, i am judging this on the acting and directing, and for what it is, it seems to work pretty well.
