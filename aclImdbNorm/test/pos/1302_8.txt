it's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clich'e you cant help but like it.<br /><br />i think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.<br /><br />it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema, not as great as my sassy girl, but still good.
