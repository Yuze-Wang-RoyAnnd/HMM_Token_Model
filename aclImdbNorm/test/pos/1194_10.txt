absolutely amazing! humor, up-beat music and an anti-war message make this probably the best movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />first of all, i love how clever this movie is, particularly in the vietnam part of the plot. it's interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous. follow that with the serious situation of the actual war, and then the conclusion (which leaves me seething with anger at the war); and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. wow.<br /><br />also, the music is really cool. but what is very unique in this musical (as opposed to evita, or wizard of oz, for example) is that the lyrics don't tell the story. the mood does (along with the visuals and between-songs-dialog): "donna" is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood, whereas "flesh failures" has a driving, intense beat, in a minor key.<br /><br />also, i notice the lsd scene is not very flattering. now i'm definitely not going to do drugs (not that i ever intended to).<br /><br />all things considered, this is an amazing movie. the only negative comment i could say is that it's sometimes hard to hear the dialog. but who cares? 10/10 stars!
