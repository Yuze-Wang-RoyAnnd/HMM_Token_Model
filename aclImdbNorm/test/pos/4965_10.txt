this is a video version of a stage production, with extra shooting for the video edition. the result gains both the drama of the stage with the impact of well produced film. the set by george tsypin, with sculptures and masks by julie taymor are superb.<br /><br />jessye norman is terrific, and one gets to hear (and see) the young bryn terfel. this production is stunning, emotional and majestic. if you don't see this you have missed out.
