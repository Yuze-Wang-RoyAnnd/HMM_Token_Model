i rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated. it's more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father was, than anything about architecture.<br /><br />more than anything else, the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric, highly praised, possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is profession.<br /><br />the tragedy of the film is the broken families he left. his baby-mothers came across more as scorned fans than irresponsible women, which can only have negative results on the children.<br /><br />that said, nathaniel, the producer of the film and son of louis khan, came across as fairly stable and curious, if not bitter. the people he interviewed were of course more interested in talking about louis khan's buildings than his personal problems, but i find the mix of themes made the film interesting.<br /><br />as for his buildings, i found them like abstract art - strange, non-practical, and usually only appreciated by so-called critics.
