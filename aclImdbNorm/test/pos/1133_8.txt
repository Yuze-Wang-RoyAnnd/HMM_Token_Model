i just recently stumbled upon this show when abc family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered. i remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007, and thought it would be short lived, and not very well written, because it was on abc family.<br /><br />never doubt an abc family show! this show surprised me in the best way possible. not only is the show well written, story lines are realistic, funny, and enjoyable. i was expecting a lot of talk about relationships, something like "this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid... etc." but this show is anything but! the characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them all. there is a lot of chemistry between the actors, and they can really make you feel like the stuff is happening right before your eyes.<br /><br />don't doubt this show, it is truly enjoyable to watch... and get hooked on ;)
