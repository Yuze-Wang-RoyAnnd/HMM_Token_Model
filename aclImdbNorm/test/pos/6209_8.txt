preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.<br /><br />there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.<br /><br />typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.
