recently i saw this movie again (after 25 years). in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between jacqueline bisset's character and michael brandon's character. the rented version did not have this scene in it. did i imagine this?<br /><br />or, is this part of the "clean up" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not "appropriate"?<br /><br />i love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together. her husband thought it was us as well.<br /><br />thank you, joan
