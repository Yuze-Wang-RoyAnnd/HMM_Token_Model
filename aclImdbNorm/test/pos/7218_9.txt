this film is a brilliant retelling of shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "kinky sex, body piercing, and dismemberment". it does follow the same spirit as all the other troma movies [except combat shock...that sucker was depressing] but it's not only for troma fans. anybody who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie.<br /><br />don't expect pretentious, artistic-wannabe crap like the version of r&j with claire danes and leo dicaprio; this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that. the acting is also surprisingly good, and you can just feel sammy capulet's pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head.<br /><br />the soundtrack, which contains many original and high-energy bands like the wesley willis fiasco, supernova, and the meatmen is also four-star. this movie should be viewed by all, because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam-packed with troma's trademark gore/sex humor.
