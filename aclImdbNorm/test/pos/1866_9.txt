i saw the world premiere at the toronto international film fest, this is a great film.<br /><br />real-life husband and wife paul bettany and jennifer connelly star as charles and emma darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish "origin of species". their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve.<br /><br />jon amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and john collee do and excellent job of bringing randal keynes' biography to life. they created some very poignant and human moments, great cinematography and sets and a generous helping of tongue-in-cheek about the still divisive theory of evolution.<br /><br />the surprise star is martha west who plays annie darwin, the character around whom much of the story unfurls. she plays the precocious young girl to a tee. if this performance is anything to go by her star should be on the rise.<br /><br />all in all a great film, and although it is a period drama the issues that drive it are still very much alive today.
