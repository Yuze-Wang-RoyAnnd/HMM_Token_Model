televised in 1982, from a los angeles production, this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter. issued on dvd in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite stunning. hearn and lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated. of course it is sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. if anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of the american musical form listen to this. the sets are stark, as befits the plot, and clever in allowing the swift scene changes required and the cameras catch the action without obliterating the fact that this is a stage production. a central, move-able and revolving platform is mrs. lovett's pie shop, with the barber's shop upstairs. around it are various gantries and moving stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place. the brutal tale of injustice leading to revenge, murder and mayhem is liberally spiced with dark humour and comic moments. sondheim does for barber shops what hitchcock did for showers ! an important work in american musical theatre is here given an electrifying performance.
