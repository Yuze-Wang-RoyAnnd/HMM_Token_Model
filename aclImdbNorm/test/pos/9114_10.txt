this movie was amazing!!!! from beginning to end, the movie is packed with fun, laughs, music, enjoyable rock music, hot chicks, more music, action, drama, and the f-bomb.<br /><br />although some scenes are entirely bizarre and unfitting, they were fun to watch and enjoyable. all in all this movie left you feeling great and happy. especially those that love rock music.<br /><br />the soundtrack is great, the laughs are plentiful, and the storyline is simple, entertaining, yet complex. you have to see this movie if you love rock music!<br /><br />overall vote: 10 out of 10!
