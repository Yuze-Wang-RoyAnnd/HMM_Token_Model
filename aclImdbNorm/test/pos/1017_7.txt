there is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (i, for one, was sure it was the teacher. in fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. i guess the point of that is that "rape is omnipresent. you never know who it is going to be".) ms. beller is luminous as always (yet see kb discussion board for my qualification of this statement). like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point. unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip. blythe danner, as the mom, is in the role she was born to play: the fretting, over-protective mom. some good 70s scenes for 70s fans. (the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark-stained beams, barrels, oak and cork). a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s high school melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.
