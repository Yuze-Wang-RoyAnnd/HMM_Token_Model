i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in 1991. i was 12 then and wil wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent crush. i am now 23 and i still love this movie. the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho-guy movie! it is wrought with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen. i only wish that it was available on dvd!
