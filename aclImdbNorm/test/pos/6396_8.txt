my wife and kids is a good and funny series that truly shows the worries and problems that happen the most even in the best families.<br /><br />michael kyle (daddy) is a man who is always trying to stop his children from doing teen's stuff like partying, drinking, loving or making love. when they do something wrong, he is right there to correct them (by the way he loves to make bad penalties)<br /><br />janet 'jay' kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. she understands that their children are teenagers and like to do "wrong" things, unlike michael does<br /><br />michael kyle 'jr' is a dumb guy who believes in everything other people say. in the beginning of the series, he's such a cool guy and tries to be like his father, but lately, i don't know why, he becomes a very very dumb dude and he starts being a problematic guy. in the end of the series he falls in love with vanessa and becomes a father, or should i say, a dumb father who does nothing right<br /><br />kady kyle is a typical teenagers who loves to party, kiss and drink. she has many problems with her parents because they invade her privacy too much. she has a boyfriend called tony who is catholic and is scared of everything, so we can't understand what makes she date him. i can remember one episode that they're prepared to have sex, but michael kyle scares tony claiming that sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to guard himself until he's married.<br /><br />i resume this is the best series of my life and i still watch it everyday after 3 years so i recommend to all of you - mostly for teenagers.
