frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic. he plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can't avoid running into his old friends. he had been arrested originally not for any drug-related charge, but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game. his skill at poker has earned him the nickname of the man with the golden arm, and the men who run the game, one of them being his former heroin connection, want him to deal again. meanwhile, frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident, zosch (eleanor parker), and make up with his old girlfriend, molly (kim novak). the film is great at putting us in sinatra's mental state. when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film, i felt good for him. but, when a promised phone call doesn't come one day, he descends into depression and goes back on the smack. later, when he finally gets to audition, he arrives completely strung out. his embarrassment when he can't play the correct beat is devastating. he had such big dreams, and the other musicians don't even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room. the film moves quickly and it shows frank's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture. the actors are uniformly fine. elmer bernstein's score is one of the best of its time. the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending.<br /><br />spoilers<br /><br />although i really like the character of zosch and parker is very good in the film, they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory. the ending is a little too pat. while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes, zosch's death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly. frank is free to love molly and he won't go to jail. also, his dealer is dead, so at least the immediate threat is gone. well, i guess in hollywood there's always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package. it harms the film a little, but, as it stands, it's still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of. 9/10.
