i first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! it's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous monterey/big sur coast) never get old. roy thinnes portrays johnny brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. the acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (thinnes as brant). i have searched for a copy to buy for years - i guess tv movies don't get released to video, unfortunately. great movie, see it if you can find it.
