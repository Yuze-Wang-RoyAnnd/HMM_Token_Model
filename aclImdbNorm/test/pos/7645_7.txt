this is a quirky heist/caper film, one that seems predictable at first then keeps surprising until the last scene. the protagonist is a grifter who goes to work in a little carnival, where he's paid to kill the manager's belly dancer wife divana then ends up falling for her himself. she's alluring, tricky and deadly and she keeps disappearing and popping up again like some sort of magician's trick. the film's other props include her duplicitous husband/employer (played by the talented armand assante), some nasty dominican mobsters and most important to the plot, a suitcase full of money. just like the old "shell game," the one where you have to guess which one the pea's under, you'll be guessing who's got the money, and like the victims of the hucksters who run such games, you'll probably guess wrong. dagma dominczyk, as lovely divana, is a talented performer and an eyeful, whether she's dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders or working her grift on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. norman reedus is fine as the young con who is flummoxed by the elusive beauty he was paid to kill. don't count him out, however, for he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for. this oddball film is worth a look.
