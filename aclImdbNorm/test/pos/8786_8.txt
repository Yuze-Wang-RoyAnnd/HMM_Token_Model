barry kane (robert cummings) is wrongfully accused on sabotaging a hanger making aircrafts for the war. he goes on the run, meets patricia martin (priscilla lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice.<br /><br />there are a lot of things wrong with this film. robert cummings was a good actor but he's totally miscast in this role; priscilla lane is pretty but was never a good actress; the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense (and rambles on longer than needed); it wears its patriotism a bit much (but this was made while wwii was in full swing) and there's no ending. it shouldn't work but it does.<br /><br />it's full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest.<br /><br />for example: lane says to cummings (while they're falling in love), "i wish i could have met you a hundred years ago" (????!!!!); lane pays a villain for getting her lunch and cummings and lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run. also hitchcock's direction was (as always) just great--he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences--especially the statue of liberty climax. <br /><br />this is not one of hitchcock's classic movie but is still very good and worth catching.
