it was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. the director maintained focus on the main subject without venturing into side plots (the doctor's family or stories of the other hospital patients), that are so typical of bollywood assembly-line products. he kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are true to the characters that they are supposed to portray. the rustic ways of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and unemotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the movie a feel of genuineness. i am also glad that the director did not fall for the temptation of adding songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of anand or safar. a couple of scenes toward the end of the movie, such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy claps at the sound of splashing and birds chirping are sure make your eyes misty.<br /><br />many bollywood players do not realize that oscar committee members value simplicity of the subject and genuineness and brevity of the movie more than the glitz and glamor. shwaas is certainly a better nomination than lagaan, which dealt with a subject that has already been beaten to death. no mpaa member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and a lot of song and dance.<br /><br />i look forward to more movies from director sandeep sawant in the future.
