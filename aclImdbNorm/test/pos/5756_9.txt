okay, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. actually, there isn't a bit of "sophisticatedlyness"* in it. it's puerile, adolescent, inoffensive, idiotic..and utterly hilarious. basically, richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain. cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up, try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay, have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door...and fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. give it a try if you're a fan of rik and ade and their work. if you're not...don't get the movie. simple as that.<br /><br />*i'm not being thick, this is a word from another one of rik's fab jaunts into the movie world ^_^
