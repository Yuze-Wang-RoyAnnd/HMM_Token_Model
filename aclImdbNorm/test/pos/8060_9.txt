this is a film that every child should see before they grow and get distorted often passed down ideas from generation to generation of family. i grew up in two different places although only 20 miles apart. i went to school & had friends of every color creed & religion for the first 8 years of my life. then i moved to hillbilly country (although not anymore) where it was very unusual to even have one african-american kid in your class. my graduating class in high school had 2 or 3 african-amercians (god why can't i just say black? you can call me a honky or whitey or whatever! all of this political correctness peeves me as it does most others!) anyway back to the film give this a try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or just what ignorance or a lack of understanding does to a culture or a country! this is an excellent film everyone should see especially children.
