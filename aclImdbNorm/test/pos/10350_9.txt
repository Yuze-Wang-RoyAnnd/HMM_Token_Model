i'm so glad i taped this film when it came on bbc last month! it blew my mind, so gut wrenching and real. david tennant is absolutely fabulous in this, even though his character isn't always that easy to like or identify with. the final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart, those eyes....<br /><br />i'm guessing that he made this film in between the dr. who series, and that makes it even more of an achievement for me. i just love dr. who and yet i saw absolutely nothing of him in mr. tennants portrayal of this man who knows that he has changed and struggles to create some sort of new identity and life.<br /><br />great little intense drama!
