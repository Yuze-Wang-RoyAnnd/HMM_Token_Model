okay, so i don't understand why people are getting so aggravated over this movie. so i thought it was going to be the usual amanda bynes movie, but it wasn't. it was great.<br /><br />okay, okay, so the acting wasn't the best, but i thought the performances were still overall great. also, you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie. in other movies, that have surprisingly won awards, where the actors didn't like working on the film, you could tell. all of the actors had chemistry, and that also showed.<br /><br />a ton of people are ripping on the soccer skills that the actors have. yah, so they're not perfect...get over it! they are actors, not soccer players. i have been playing soccer for my whole life, and trust me, it is hard to learn, so stop ripping on the level of skills they have.<br /><br />i thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. the way amanda bynes and channing tatum can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny. i found myself laughing a lot in this movie.<br /><br />overall..i love it!
