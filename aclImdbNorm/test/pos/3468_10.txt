i've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i first caught the trailer, and i'm so glad now that i have. it's truly a wonderful film. the actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. i love james mcavoy in this, and i can't wait to see him in "the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe" movie this december. romola garai is wonderful too. be sure to check her out in "i capture the castle" or "nicholas nickleby," two of my favorite films. overall, i think i liked this movie because it didn't chicken out. it's a difficult subject matter to tell a story about, in that you're very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overly-sentimental-sugary-sweet love fest. but they avoided doing that completely, and instead made a film that's real, honest, and touching, yes, but never over-the-top. very well done. amazingly well done. go out and see it, and you'll know exactly what i mean.
