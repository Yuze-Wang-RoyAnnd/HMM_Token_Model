thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck. this one was another totally unexpected gem. usually, i'm not even a suspense/thriller fan. this satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a boardwalk pretzel. it has titillating erotic romance, reminiscent of "body heat" in more ways than one; it has cops and crime; political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap. it has just the right touch of gritty violence that any professional "by-the-numbers" crime job must employ. emma thompson, (fbi aic), delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for best fake southern accent by a limey. alan rickman, (local cop), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not overbearing. they work well as a pair. lots of plot misdirection that never gets out of control and gets coherently reconnected at film's end. and who is this awesome woman, carla gugino? i want her to bear my children. carla, if you're out there, let's do lunch
