i saw the movie "hoot" and then i immediately decided to comment it. the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! this movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. when i was twelve, i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that i might harm them actually. (i am currently 15) what so ever, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie!!! and enjoy!
