disgused as an asian horror, "a tale of two sisters" is actually a complex character driven psychological drama, that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family. i was really surprised at the depth of this movie. director ji-woon kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares, has proved a correct one. creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies.<br /><br />"a tale of two sisters" tels the story, as it's name suggest of two sisters su-mi and the younger su-yeon, who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother. from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmother's gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior. to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience. so i'll just leave it at that.<br /><br />the plot is very tightly written. with the characters nicely fleshed out. ji-woon kim's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another. furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character. from the protective su-mi, the weaker su-yeon, the visibly uninterested father to the stepmother's frantic and later deadly behavior. there is great sense of mystery, with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation. even after watching it once, the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it.<br /><br />the actors superbly fit their roles. it is especially hard to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat. ji-woon kim's direction is slow paced and gripping, building up tension for the film's horroresque scenes. while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying. the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film.<br /><br />"a tale of two sisters" is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride. with it's strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better.
