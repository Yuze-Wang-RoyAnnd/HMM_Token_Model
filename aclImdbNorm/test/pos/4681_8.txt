the italian job is a real blast to watch. it's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. it's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. it's just a fun movie. between watching the little mini coopers fly around the crowded streets of l.a. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by seth greene), i had a lot of fun watching this film.<br /><br />special kudos to the background music. they truly set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed. apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music, i found it to be the classiest part of the film.<br /><br />8 out of 10. not awe-inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.<br /><br />barky
