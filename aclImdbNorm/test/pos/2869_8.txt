see no evil with kane. the movie has a great storyline but it just wasn't a hide my eye's, scream out loud horror flick i thought it was going to be from watching the wwe superstars on monday night raw when the movie first came to theaters. i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out.<br /><br />great movie excellent would like to see a part 2 <br /><br />it doesn't matter if kane gets killed at the end<br /><br />or not they have killed off other horror stars in every movie <br /><br />they have out and they still comeback for more so a part 2 would<br /><br />be very interesting.
