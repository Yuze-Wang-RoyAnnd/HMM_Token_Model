le cercle rouge is a very good film, though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films. in all too many ways, the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as rififi and grand slam and many others. so, while director melville and the actors did great jobs, it all seems like a case of d'ej`a vu. because of this, i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score.<br /><br />the one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together. instead of the usual means, vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with corey, a career criminal just released from prison! both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch. apart from that, as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime. i also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached manner--something relatively common in french crime films but rare among american films until recent years.<br /><br />overall, extremely well-crafted and worth seeing...if you don't mind that it seems a tad repetitive, you'll see some fine acting, direction and a lot of great tension.
