evil ed is a swedish film about a man named ed (of course)and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of b horror films known as "the loose limbs" series. ed becomes so mad that he thinks he's seeing demons and monsters but in reality they are people he knows and people that are close to him, such as his wife and daughter.<br /><br />i first saw this movie back in 1998 and was baffled by what i had seen. to this day, this movie i consider to be one of the darkest comedies out there. as the movie is almost slapstick funny with its gore scenes there are still a few creepy moments.<br /><br />this is a cool flick but don't expect anything marvelous. it's simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs. 8/10 stars
