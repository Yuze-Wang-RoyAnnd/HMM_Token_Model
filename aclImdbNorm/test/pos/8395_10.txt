this is one of the most cerebral insightful movies i have ever seen. the script language, costumes, scenery, plot, characters, etc. all are supreme. you will not be bored. i have watched intensely or even just listened to this movie while working so many times i have lost count. scarlett ages gracefully, acquiring wisdom beyond her years in the end. this movie takes you from tara to ireland where her family is originally from and you see the results of another civil war played out there, this time between the irish and english.<br /><br />this movie depicts the double standards of men at the time--a man is still respected if he has girlfriends and whores, but not a woman. if she is merely seen in a private place with a man society accuses her of impropriety. and of course scarlett was always thinking outside the box, breaking rules when necessary to create needed change, help people, and/or survive.<br /><br />scarlett's beauty definitely is to the bone. her strength, self-esteem, and wisdom grow as she ages. <br /><br />i remember her lines when i am confronted with too much on my plate, such as, "tomorrow is another day," and the way she carried herself, her determination and courage, and have learned from her experiences. this is a good movie to show your daughters as it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for yourself, and that men, especially very handsome ones, can have two sides and may treat a woman differently, depending on how she acts and respects herself. an attractive woman needs to learn what this movie teaches. <br /><br />this movie is like therapy to me, and it is better than gone with the wind. the second part takes place in ireland and anyone who is of irish decent will cherish the scenery, people, and scarlett's character within it.
