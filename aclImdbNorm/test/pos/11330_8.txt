two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography. it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 2000. close ups predominated it. close ups of walls, humans and of many other things. the warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it. an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time. each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie. silence and slow movements characterize the movie. some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups. not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant. i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes. the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s. this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end. in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema.
