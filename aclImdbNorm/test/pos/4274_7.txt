this show really is the broadway american idol. it has singing, the british guy, a guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.<br /><br />of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). <br /><br />i gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that i know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. the first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home. i know they want to find the right danny and sandy, but america should have the power to decide who does home. there's really no point to the sing-off. the person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. another things i'd change is to see them actually act on the show. what's broadway without the acting? the last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end. the eliminated danny always sings the same song and the eliminated sandy always sings the same song as they exit. since they sing it every week those songs eventually get annoying.<br /><br />i admit to not being a fan of the movie, grease, but for some reason i am hooked. this show is very underrated. it has so many memorable performances and moments.
