hello all denver fans!<br /><br />i couldn't agree more with you guys! this show was so cool and cute, i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s. among denver are other favourite too, such as care bears and rainbow brite. i am 24 now, but it is still one of my favourite shows, and my favourite cartoon from the 80s. it brings back all the memories. the theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. it is sad that it lasted such a short time, but it has remained a firm favourite. its great that i am not alone and that there are people out there who liked it too. this is one of the cartoon shows i shall keep for future generations. <br /><br />viva denver! :)
