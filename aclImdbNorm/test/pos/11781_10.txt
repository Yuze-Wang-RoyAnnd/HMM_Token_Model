the hysterical hardware wars is finally out on dvd. hw has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a riotous little 20 minute short but a staple in low budget film production classes, which is where a lot of the film's cult status is derived from and resides. with the dvd, not only do we get a chance to revisit the original parody (4q2, cinnamon-bun head, ballistic toast, et al) that ernie f. did in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material showcasing the fosselius wit. antique sideshow is a dead-on parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. the director's commentary is also hysterical, as is the creature feature which parodies taking a film out on the talk-show circuit and actually is based on taking hw out on the talk show circuit, albeit the public access circuit. i'd love to see ernie, michael wiese and crew take on some other, contemporary overblown and overbudgeted targets to parody -- like just about any film that hollywood churns out at $100 million a pop these days -- not so much the crafty films like spider man or men in black (actually parodies themselves!) but any number of overblown, overhyped, overwrought and overpriced features.<br /><br />
