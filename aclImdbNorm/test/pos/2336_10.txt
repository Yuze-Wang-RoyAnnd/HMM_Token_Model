i've enjoyed this movie ever since i first saw it in the theatre. some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. the characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals, without ever preaching morality. the situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. the tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. the movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through. this is a feel good movie as good as they come.<br /><br />what amazes me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining. the music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies, which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder. the scenes in the credits are a great music video of "in the navy", which deserve their own full screen special feature. the scenes and cuts are crafted well, and the casting and acting is right on.<br /><br />this movie is a classic as great as any ever made, without any pretensions. in fact, the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch. i love these guys and gal.<br /><br />the other day i thought of the film, and wondered whether it was available on dvd. good fortune has come to us, and the dvd came out in may 2004. i headed to the store, and snapped up a copy. then my wife and i enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen. i've rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels, far better than many high budget films and oscar winners. this is entertainment.<br /><br />listen up fox home video: you have a great movie in your vaults, and it's a shame to find a cheap shot dvd with badly degraded off tint colors only 8 years since release. so why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen? i'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right. i'm grateful to have my own copy. now give us the eye candy that the film deserves, and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature.
