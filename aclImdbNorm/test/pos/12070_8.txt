this is not a great movie as tho the cast (especially the kids) admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with clich'e upon clich'e. poor family in 50's mid america, dying mother, alcoholic father, 10 children (1 of whom has epilepsy) and an awful decision to be made. its very easy to watch and some of the kids performances are moving without being sickly or naff. and little frank and warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me bawling no matter how many times i see it. a great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all. only those with the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it. not on a par to sophies choice but a good tv movie equivalent!!!
