while researching susan harrison (the ballerina) in reference to a bonanza episode, i was reminded of this gem.<br /><br />this episode is the inspiration for dylan's "all along the watch tower" (hendrix's cover is probably as well know and is one of his best) which is one of his best.<br /><br />thus this episode is responsible for several 'bests' - not bad for approximately 22 minutes of television.<br /><br />but this is "the twilight zone". further comment of the series is unnecessary.<br /><br />'5 characters' is typical serling. intense, dramatic, barreling toward an end that is as inevitable in hindsight as it is surprising the first time you see it.<br /><br />this episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for any who have not seen it.<br /><br />but you will feel ambushed. and you will never listen to hendrix with the same ears again.
