continuing his comeback, john travolta played a mildly twisted angel in "michael". he may be a messenger of god, but he's not the nicest guy, as reporters andie macdowell and william hurt discover. when i first saw this movie, it was before i had started watching "all in the family", so i didn't recognize jean stapleton as edith bunker. now that i recognize her like that, i try to imagine archie snapping at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rank alongside blacks, jews, etc).<br /><br />i know, that doesn't really relate to the movie. but i just like to associate things that way. anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. also starring bob hoskins, teri garr and richard schiff.<br /><br />what john and paul said...
