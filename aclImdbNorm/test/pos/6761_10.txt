this movie is the funniest danish movie i've ever seen!<br /><br />the plot is funny, surprising and exceptionel. danish humor is unlike any other, and it gets you every time. the entire audience laughed 90 % of the time....it was incredible. the characters are so well played, and the two actors, mads mikkelsen and nikolaj lie kaas play their best ever!<br /><br />i would highly recomend seing this movie, you won't regret it, believe me :-)
