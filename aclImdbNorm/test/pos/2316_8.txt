you know sometimes you just gotta have it? that's how this movie is with me. i am almost embarrassed to admit that i like it, it is so goofy in some parts, but i find myself reaching for it when i'm down and just need a good laugh...and trust me, i am just not a "goofy movie" kinda guy.<br /><br />you can read the synopsis so i don't have to bore you with that, just rest assured, if you like kelsey grammer you will probably like this movie.<br /><br />one more thing, be sure to watch the end credits. you don't need to read them, just watch them and catch the performance of "in the navy" by the village people...and friends.
