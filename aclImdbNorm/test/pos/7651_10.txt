we stumbled across this show one sunday morning at 6:30 a.m. while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on! it is absolutely adorable. we need shows like this for children (and adults, as i'm certainly way beyond my childhood years.) as one of the other commentaries pointed out, this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines. the puppets are fantastically cute, the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard, foam, paint, and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhoods, when we could spend the day at our own grandma's house, exploring the world around us. for those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as nana, this show is for you, you'll make up for lost time! this show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor and just outright fun, for children and adults alike. in other words, don't overlook this show, just because you're over the age of three! spend a half hour with mona, nana, mr. wooka, and russell, they'll be friends you look forward to seeing!
