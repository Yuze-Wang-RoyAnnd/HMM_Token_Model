this show came to canada via pbs in the mid 90s and i really, really loved it then. even 10 yrs later watching the various news networks, i cant help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of ratings and the various "show ponies" we all see on tv as depicted in various frontline episodes. the scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of it is encumbered by an idiotic laugh track. there is a lot of funny material here really well executed and we don't need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at. i don't understand why this show never took off in north america as its truly a gem! i was really excited to see the dvds available, even though they are pal format. i figured i would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files. i took a chance and ordered it from abc
