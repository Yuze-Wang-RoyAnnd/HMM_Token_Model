i've seen many dustin hoffman's movies like straw dogs or rain man and i liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. i expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in straw dogs, but i saw a totally different person. he was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of al pacino in serpico. the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. this movie is also revealing. personally, i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.
