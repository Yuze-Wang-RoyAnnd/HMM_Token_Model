i was fortunate enough to be an extra in this movie when i was about 13 during the roller rink scenes. my junior high school drama class was invited to participate. it was a fantastic experience.<br /><br />gary busey, charles martin smith and don stroud played the music live, all day! as a musician, i can appreciate the tireless work and dedication these guys put in to their roles. they must have played those songs 20 times. it's very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under those conditions. this is visible during a cut to a close-up on "that'll be the day," but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably wouldn't have picked it up.<br /><br />skating around all day, getting the day off from school and being transported back in time was a incredible thrill. i also had my first "date" on film. i had to walk a girl up to the ticket booth. woo hoo! even with an out-of-date haircut and hot lights melting the vaseline in my hair, it was still worth it. fun stuff.<br /><br />the movie is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole. busey delivers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb. i'm glad to have participated in a great film of the day. to think i could have been in corvette summer or something. not.<br /><br />a funny ironic ending to this is that years later i was in a video store in malibu looking at the movie the week it was released on video. gary busey walked in and stood right next to me. i showed him the cover and babbled on how great he was and how i was an extra and whatnot. pretty weird, but very cool, for what it's worth.
