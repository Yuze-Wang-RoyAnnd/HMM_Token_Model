it is important and only fair to remember that, at the time this short was produced, a state of war existed between the united states and the empire of japan. add to that the enormous ill-will that the beginning of the war created, as well as the bataan death march and other incidents and the only thing surprising about this short and others is that there weren't more of them. one other thing: my only problem with this short is that it seems to try to be funny, but it isn't. i'm not sure that anyone connected with it really tried to make the jokes work, or even cared. it would have been far better if they had done what disney did with education for death and been totally serious. but this short gets a bad rap and shouldn't be judged out of context. the times were different then and that is an important consideration. anyone expending energy trying to save the world from a sixty-year old cartoon needs to take a step back. as do i, expending energy defending that same cartoon. this should be available to interested parties, even if not in wide circulation. not a nice cartoon, but sometimes life isn't nice. recommended
