if you're familiar with the work of auteur johnny to and his band of filmmaking cronies over at milky way, you know what to expect with this latest production. all the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a cop and a baddie, the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end, and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations.<br /><br />andy lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company. lau ching-wan (also brilliant in other milky way films like "longest nite," "a hero never dies," and "where a good man goes") portrays a hostage negotiator/cop who is on the robber's tail, even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man.<br /><br />funny, poignant, and cool while being subtle, "running" is actually one of the most entertaining milky way films to date. don't miss the performances by the two leads, esp. andy lau, usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch. this film is one to go out of your way to see.
