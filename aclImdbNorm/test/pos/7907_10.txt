my cousins and i have watched this movie ever since we were little. i don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.<br /><br />i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is. the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch. it is an old movie but don't let that fool you. this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.
