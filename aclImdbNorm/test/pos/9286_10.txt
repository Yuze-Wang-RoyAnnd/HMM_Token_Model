if i was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life, i would definitely have to pick "the chaser's war on everything". of all the satirical shows that have been on australian television, i found "chaser" to be the funniest of all. it is just so amazing, the boys aren't afraid to do anything.<br /><br />whether it's dress up as hitler to get into a polish club, or push a massive ball of string around melbourne to try out the tourism ad's or rock up to the coke factory naked in a bath with $2.40 to buy some water. the chaser boys will go there.<br /><br />in agreement with the comments above (and/or below) "the chaser's war on everything" is more popular than their previous program "cnnnn". but cnnnn was just as funny. some unforgettable moments from that show... clean up cambodia!!! classic.<br /><br />so anyway to stop me from ranting further, i strongly advise you to at least give chaser a chance, you'll more than likely find it hilarious!!!!
