first, i'm a huge buddy holly fan. i grew up knowing who he was, and i knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that. but i had never truly listened to his music. i had heard much of it, yes, but not until i sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did i truly come to see the real buddy holly. and let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him.<br /><br />because of this adoration for such an incredible man, i bought the buddy holly story without ever seeing it previously. i'm torn on my views of this film. perhaps it's because buddy feels so alive to me that i just couldn't bear seeing gary busey in this role. i'll admit that he did a nice job acting, but his singing sounded so forced. it seemed to me as if he knew he didn't sound a bit like buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound. in some parts of the film, he succeeded. but others.. ouch.<br /><br />the movie spanned a period of several years, but i feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better. i had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in buddy's life certain events were happening. i also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. i think the worst one was the portrayal of the crickets. i understand how their real names couldn't be used, and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie.. and maybe this was a good thing. because the film's background vocals were cringe-worthy, and i disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to buddy's career. something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was gary busey's teeth. they wore me out! buddy holly had much better teeth. i don't know why i noticed it.. but i did.<br /><br />i'll end this review on what i felt was the best part of the movie: buddy's last performance. his final phone call to maria, the big bopper's performance, bringing him and richie valens to the stage, followed by the still frame ending. it startled even me, and i feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment buddy holly was so alive and energetic, and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye. it was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy i think.<br /><br />good movie, despite the obvious problems.. 7/10.<br /><br />some obvious flaws, could use some work... but not bad.
