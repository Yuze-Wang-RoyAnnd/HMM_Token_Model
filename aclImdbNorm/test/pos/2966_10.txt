i liked this movie. i wasn't really sure what it was about before i started watching it, but enjoyed it nonetheless. it was about a girl (meredith monroe) whose mom didn't want her to turn out like she did. she meets and falls in love with a boy (riley smith) who is town for a charity football game. it's a good movie. i just hope it will be on again or comes out on video.
