*spoilers*<br /><br />i don't care what anyone says, this movie is friggin' hilarious. this is the sequel to jack frost, a movie about a killer snowman. the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying dna manipulation chemicals that make human dna bond with dirt, or in this case, snow. the first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him.<br /><br />or so they thought.<br /><br />this movie takes place about a year after the second. some scientists resurrect jack frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. no explanation is ever given for why they do this, they just do. meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested frost in the first is going to the bahamas. unfortunately, the snowman comes with him.<br /><br />this movie has it all. it has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. yes, killer snowballs. they even say "dada!" like babies. i'll have to give the makers of this credit. the snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up. i wish that i could get one as a pet. frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns.<br /><br />then there's the actors. there's manners, the fbi agent from the first movie, except here he's wearing an eyepatch. yarr mateys, shiver me timbers, i be an fbi agent! yarrr! and then there's the stereotypical british adventurer and the stereotypical black jamaican with dreadlocks. and finally, captain fun. the fruitiest man on the face of the planet, bar none.<br /><br />this movie isn't scary, but is is hilarious. i laughed my butt off the whole way through, and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good "bad" movie.<br /><br />*** out ****
