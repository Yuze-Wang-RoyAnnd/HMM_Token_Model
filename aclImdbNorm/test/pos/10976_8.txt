manna from heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human foibles to entertain the audience. throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will surface in each situation. the result is that the movie goer finds himself/herself sitting with this silly grin on his/her face, peace in his/her heart, and high expectations for human kind. watching this movie was a most pleasant experience. (i would venture to say uplifting experience, but some would say that sounds corny!!)
