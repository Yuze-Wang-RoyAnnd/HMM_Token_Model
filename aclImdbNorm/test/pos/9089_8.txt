this film has a decidedly weird setting, taking place in a school that's really old to begin with but it certainly doesn't look like any sterile medical school environment. very gothic and atmospheric. as for the film itself, well, ok, the premise is a bit far-fetched but hey, that's why we watch movies, isn't it? and it's less far-fetched than some of the garbage that's out these days, that's for sure. medical students are experimenting with 'short term' death, as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like. it's kind of nice, in some cases, till parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives. i hadn't seen this film in years till i got it on dvd and i have to say that i'd forgotten just how good it was. and it struck me that julia roberts looks truly beautiful in this film, not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made-up like cheap hookers. ahh, the good old days. anyway, this is a great flick, perhaps not for fundamentalist christians but many others may enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.
