another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of american suburbia, imaginary heroes chronicles the lives of the travis family, all recovering following the suicide of their eldest son.<br /><br />the pair at the center of the film is mother and son sandy (sigourney weaver) and tim (emile hirsch), both acting out in different ways as a result of the death. while tim experiments with prescription medication and his own sexuality, sandy regresses to her former self, smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity.<br /><br />the relationship between sandy and tim is explored well, especially when references are made to both of them being outcast from their own family: sandy due to her affair and tim, initially, due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother. considerably less time is allowed for sandy's husband ben (jeff daniels) who, in a devastating depiction of denial, orders sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table. michelle williams' older sister penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film.<br /><br />despite its long runtime, imaginary heroes doesn't explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve, while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't translate as well as writer/director dan harris may have liked. and the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas. but despite some issues, the central performances from weaver and hirsch are stunning, and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion.<br /><br />rating: b-
