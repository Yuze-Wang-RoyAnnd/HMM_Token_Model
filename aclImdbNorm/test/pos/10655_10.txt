i did something a little daring tonight when i watched this movie. i attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. sure, when this film originally was distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. oftentimes, the director would choose the score himself (charlie chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). but most of the music you hear on vhs tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. and, then again, there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. i do not know the history of potemkin's score, so i decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film. <br /><br />soon after i turned the music off, unaided (or should i say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen, i became utterly attached to the film. visually, it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. eisenstein was a master of composition. the editing, possibly the cinematic technique eisenstein is most famous for (montage), is extraordinary. the mood of this film is anger, and it stirred my passions violently. <br /><br />it takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film, especially a drama, but films like battleship potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. come on! you owe it to yourself to watch this film! your education is incomplete without it.
