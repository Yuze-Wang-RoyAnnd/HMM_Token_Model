charles bronson is back in his most famous role. in my opinion, this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever. this movie doesn't take itself seriously, because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film. golan and globus made this film for bronson fans, not for the critics, and it works. dw3 has been unfairly criticized as "trash" and "a weary entry in a worn out series." these statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement, but it wasn't. if you take it as what it is, dw3 is just a fun, action packed romp, with charlie doing to street punks what we all wish we could do. the action is non stop, the atmosphere is great, and the movie is just out and out the best bronson flick ever made. you can tell that the penny pinching cannon group spent a lot of money on this one. it is believed that bronson thought this film was too violent, and that was the reason why winner didn't direct any of the following entries. i can understand his concern, but as is always the case of sequels, you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry. in any case, this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time. what makes dw3 the best of the series and my favorite film ever (not the best, just my favorite), is the action, charlie's presence, memorable villains, and it's ability to get the viewers to jump on the bandwagon. the first film may be the most technically well made, but this one is the most fun. for once, charlie actually has some clever lines (although he doesn't say much)and a halfway interesting story, photography, action, and direction to back him up. charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one. yes, it's exploitive, maybe it does promote stereotypes, and maybe it is the same story as before, but bronson's films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see. many argue that the dw series manipulates its' audience, my reply is that the movies don't manipulate us, the fans are the ones in charge. we demand that bronson blow away deserving scum, and in turn winner and co. deliver the goods. and for those of you who still want to put it down, remember a few things. dw3 was the #1 movie in america when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics, they just have to be fun. **********/10 you can't get any better. john batchelor
