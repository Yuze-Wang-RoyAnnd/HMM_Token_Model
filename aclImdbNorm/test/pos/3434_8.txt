skenbart takes place in the 1940s, right after the second world war. main character gunnar (gustav hammarsten) quits his job to get a chance to "make a difference" in the bombed-out postwar europe. he packs a book by his favourite philisopher, ludwig witgenstein, and embarks on a trip which will eventually prove witgenstein's famous statement true: nothing is what it seems.<br /><br />there are two main plots, and several subplots, to this film, which takes place on a train bound for berlin. writer/director peter dalle (also playing the role as the conductor of the train) has assembled an impressive cast including swedish legends lena nyman, g"osta ekman and robert gustafsson. overall, the acting is excellent.<br /><br />skenbart offers some rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with more subtle black humor (like the nun who loses her faith and starts cursing violently). it's like killingg"anget meets peter jackson (braindead, bad taste) in schindler's list. i laughed during most of the film, and when i woke up the next morning i laughed even more. an intelligent film for fans of swedish comedy.
