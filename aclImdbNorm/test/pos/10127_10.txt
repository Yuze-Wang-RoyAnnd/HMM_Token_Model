radio was a very good movie, and honestly, i never cry in movies. but it had me pretty close to tears. it really got to me when radio's mom died and he just wouldn't get out of his room. i felt really sad about how, if you were mentally retarded, you wouldn't really be able to understand death. i really liked the movie, and it's a must see.
