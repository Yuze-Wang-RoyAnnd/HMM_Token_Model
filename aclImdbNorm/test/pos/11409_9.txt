i was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my age (eleven.) all of us, thinking it would be some harmless little movie such as jaws decided to rent it along with rat race. (we watched rat race after when a stranger calls as to ease our fear.) we put the movie on at 11:00 at night and lay together in our sleeping bags hiding behind covers for most of it. i screamed five times which is unusual for me as i get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream.<br /><br />all of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the stalker (jenkins as we called him for some reason)would get us. i played a mean trick; one everyone was all dozing off once rat race was over i hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and lowly "have you checked the childen?" they all screamed like nuts and were so scared. all in all i would rate this movie a 9. the only thing i didn't like was that 1. there were too many false alarms when jill thinks the stalker is there and 2. the kids never woke up during the whole thing until jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the cupboard at which time all they did was cry like babies. i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller. but one thing: i am so not babysitting past 9:00 pm ever again1!
