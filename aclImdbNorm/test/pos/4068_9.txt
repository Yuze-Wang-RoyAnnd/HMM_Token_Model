despite of all the negative criticism i really enjoyed this movie. i am not saying this lightly. i love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home dvd collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are ok, a few i do not like at all). and, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. i simply love this movie. it is light, funny, and very restful. i am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but i love it. the comedic talents of eddie murphy and robert deniro are tapped (fully - for this type of movie). do not compare it to other movies with these star actors, simply enjoy it. the cast is great and, i believe, that the purpose of this movie was fully accomplished. if you want a really "easy-going" and very restful night - watch this movie. deniro and murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it). and, please, do not be so negative. do not expect godfather performance or meet the parents from deniro, do not expect comedy blockbusters performance from murphy... it is a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day work. your sides may not split from laughter, but it is still very funny.
