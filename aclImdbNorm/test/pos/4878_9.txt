there i was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this b-movie festival in breda. i was resistant, as i hadn't gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater, but i've got to admit that i don't regret a second of this one (especially with stephen malkmus' contribution). it probably helped that i had no idea what to expect.<br /><br />sea of dust starts out like a typical costume drama. we've got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which somehow involves exploding heads). on the way, he stops to visit his fianc'e and gets thrown off the property by her father. traveling on, he finds a girl lying on the road, another plague victim, and takes her along to the doctor's. yawn, i thought. it all seemed pretty predicable.<br /><br />and then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film. tom savini shows up looking like dracula, characters begin traveling to "the other side" of reality, and the dialog gets increasingly humorous.<br /><br />and just when i thought it had settled into a groove, the picture changes again, becoming really dark and bizarre. i won't spoil it for first time viewers, but there's an amazing sequence about hollow people, lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society, and some over-the-top gore effects. and did i mention stephen malkmus? this isn't a perfect movie (in case you haven't figured that out from its appearance at a b-movie festival), but it's well worth the time for adventurous viewers. great visuals, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. the acting is a little zany at times, but i think that's the point.<br /><br />funny i had to go to breda to see find an american picture that looked like a british horror movie. you figure that one out...
