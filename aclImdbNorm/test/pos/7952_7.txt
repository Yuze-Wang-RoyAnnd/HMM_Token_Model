korean "romance" about the owner of a camera store who is diagnosed with a fatal disease. as he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a customer. a friendship and romance grows, eve though neither expresses any sort of affection for the other. good film is unlike anything you are likely to see remade in america simply because the studios would insist that the "couple" act on their feelings. he will not say anything because he doesn't have that long to live, she won't because its not the thing thats done and he is not responding as she thinks he should. of course its much more complex than i'm making it out to be and in all honesty its the sort of thing that you should discover for yourself. is it a great film? no, but it is a good one that will move you emotionally. the final lines of the film still haunts me: "i always knew that love would fade like a photograph - but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment. thank you and goodbye". it may seem odd out of context but with in the context of the film it is very moving.
