when it comes to those eerie and uncanny little crime films, the sorts that revolve around characters that are bordering on scum and inhabit equally scummy surroundings, and additionally carry that wavering and bleak feel thanks to some pretty grotty cinematography and some very black comedy; dead bodies is the sort of film paul mcguigan wishes he could make. alas, the maddening and sporadic gangster no. 1 as well as the equally all over the shop, but interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism, effort entitled the acid house are the only ones of his we've got to go on so far. dead bodies is robert quinn's piece based on a derek landy script, a film that straddles the line between psychological horror and neo-noir; intermingling elements of crime and terror with themes linked to morality and unnatural, obsessive disorders.<br /><br />mcguigan's british based crime efforts carry that wavy and distorted feel, like witnessing somebody's nightmare and having front row seats in the process. his films are able to disgust is some areas and amuse in others what with their outlandish and all-over-the-place approach. they carry a very dream-like sensibility despite being grounded in a very realistic, down-trodden, grimy looking world
