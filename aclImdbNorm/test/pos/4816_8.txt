this eloquent, simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. though a theatrical release, it has a "made-for-tv" quality. we can attribute this to the director, john frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the early days of live television in new york city. indeed, he directed the teleplay on which the film is based, "deal a blow," on the cbs drama series "climax." "young stranger" represents his hollywood debut. after a hiatus of four years, during which he would do more television, he returned to direct "the young savages" with burt lancaster and, a year after that, "all fall down" with warren beatty and angela lansbury.<br /><br />the casting is competent with james daly and kim hunter (particularly good) playing the parents of the title character performed by james macarthur (his first theatrical film) who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen. look for james gregory and whit bissell in supporting roles.
