i think a several of america's baseball movies are among the best movies ever made. when this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie. i'd read about the highland team in the newspapers, but didn't have high expectations for this film about a sport that didn't interest me.<br /><br />last night i viewed it "on-demand" and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. ryan little and the cast and crew did an amazing job. neil mcdonough was especially convincing. as the "bad dad" he displayed fine range and a subtle, but moving character arc.<br /><br />i also enjoyed the pacific islander actors. i've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. a flashback showing how the islander culture became such a key element of highland's team would have been a excellent addition to the film.<br /><br />some pretty tacky movies have been shot in utah recently. it's good to see a quality film like this from the beehive state.
