if archie bunker was armed, he may well have been "joe". however, "all in the family" would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this movie. joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot, and has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. one night he meets a man in a bar, bill, who is having a drink to soothe his frazzled nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie boyfriend and he lets that slip to joe. what happens is that bill's daughter was living with the junkie, and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose, and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend, who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. in the struggle that ensues, the boyfriend is killed accidentally and bill doesn't want anyone really to know, of course. but he lets it slip to joe, and then when the newspapers and tv reports come out, joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. he hooks up with him later and bill is of course concerned that joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with him. which is, in a way, almost worse. now, bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in, and slips back home, and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run, and most of the rest of the movie consists of joe & bill infiltrating "the underground" to try to find her. this builds up to a rather shocking ending, which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note, or wrong note, depending on your point of view. a sort of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's, mostly from a working class bigot's point of view, which makes it not for everyone, but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.
