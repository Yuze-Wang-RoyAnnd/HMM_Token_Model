kevin spacey again picks a winner with k-pax, an endearing movie that expresses profound revelations at human existence via the prot character's naive, yet at the same time unquestionably wise, point of view.<br /><br />it's enjoyable trying to work out 'if he is or he isn't' as the plot expands and the robert porter character gets fleshed out. however some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but in reality it couldn't have been any other way.<br /><br />my few issues with the film revolve around the rather cartoony and over simplified portrayal of mental patients. i was surprised because the films plot shows a great deal of intelligence and i don't feel it would have lost anything by being more honest regarding how people with mental health problems behave.<br /><br />that said, i realise this was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitly shot and the story unwraps at a pleasing rate. <br /><br />bridges is great and spacey delivers a languid and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien.<br /><br />a good film that will get you talking with your friends.
