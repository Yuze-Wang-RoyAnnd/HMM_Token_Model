i got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in brea and i have been crazy for it ever since. the film is based on shakespeare's twelfth night which i have read and loved and seen on stage a few times so i certainly liked the references. but whether you like shakespeare or not it won't matter - the movie stands on it's on. it is super funny, witty and charming. amanda bynes is hilarious and so was david cross. actually the whole cast is great - i just happen to be a huge david cross fanatic. the cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few i hadn't heard before but i know they have a cd coming out so i will definitely buy it. everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups. !!!!
