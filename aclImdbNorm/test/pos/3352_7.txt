alice enters in a world of wonder... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid. the mad hatter, the white rabbit, the queen and others (even tweedledee and tweedledum) show alice some things about her body -- and other people's bodies -- that might be quite wonderful. a tale of love and lust the likes you've never seen.<br /><br />kristine debell appears as alice. i must say, by 1970s standards, this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. i believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work, but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen (my love for all things alice is no secret). even better than "fairy tales" (which isn't really pornography, so, much).<br /><br />the songs are cheesy, but fit the theme of the movie. one song, "what's a girl like you doing on a knight like this?" was pretty funny, and the others had similar themes going. the trial towards the end was well scripted, and fit very nicely into the world of alice. the logic and humor were definitely accounted for.<br /><br />what more can you say about a film like this? all i know is, for people who are used to adult films where it's just a 30-second lead-in to the sex, this one is going to overload you with plot and music. but, personally, i think there's something very special about this film and i hope it gets a nice dvd release with things touched up and special features (if that's even possible). i can see this being a cult film.
