this is probably my favourite tv show ever. i love all the characters, especially alex, who is the perfect woman! always makes me laugh and feel good when i watch this show. there is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.<br /><br />it seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. here are a few examples. (the episodes start again when they end - but don't play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. with most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.)<br /><br />radiohead, pink floyd, bob dylan.<br /><br />2.02 'double bogey' kid a / ok computer (episode plays at least 4 times)<br /><br />2.14 'saturn' kid a / meddle / shot of love<br /><br />2.19 'world without alex' kid a / wish you were here / pablo honey(episode plays at least 4 times)<br /><br />there are clues in the episodes which tell you which albums synchronise. kid a may synchronise with every episode!
