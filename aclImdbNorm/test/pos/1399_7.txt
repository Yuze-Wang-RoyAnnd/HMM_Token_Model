this movie surprised me. the box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. the movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. the special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. it is a unique take on the dr. moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart. definitely worth-seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume/horror classics and gore-fests.
