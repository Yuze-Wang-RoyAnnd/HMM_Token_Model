this film is like "the breakfast club" meets "mad city." it's got one plot twist after another with justin walker, corey feldman, and james remar delivering really great performances. however, this movie is not for everyone. if you don't like movies that "go all the way" with regards to violence, then don't watch the last twenty minutes. my wife had to leave the room. of course, i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. this is a really gritty, realistic teen drama. i can't believe it came from b-movie king roger corman. this film is a must-see for those who are not faint of heart. highly recommended.
