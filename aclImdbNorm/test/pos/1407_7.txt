i found west point to be an agreeable film, although i doubt that i would watch it again. the performances were convincing, with william haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. it's hard to believe that stardom beckoned joan crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. <br /><br />i would apply the comment made by another concerning ramon novarro's "huddle" (1932) to this film as well. there is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking. the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized, but i was less involved than i thought that i would be. perhaps haines' character went too far, or got away with too much. his "repentance" did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the army-navy game? where's "the corps" in that? might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. also, i doubt very much that william bakewell's weak, puny character would ever have a real-life counterpart at west point.<br /><br />all this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too, unlike the vapid "traditions" of ivy league schools, only half-heartedly engaged in these days.<br /><br />as to the score: it was appropriately martial. but, there was a distinct over-use of snare drums. using them for knocks on the door, scene transitions, et alu as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. it rather lessened the viewing experience. i was ready to say "i get the point already." <br /><br />with that, enjoy the film, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.
