"murder over new york" is an entertaining entry in the charlie chan series of films, but if you're paying attention, a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye. while traveling to new york city for an annual police convention, chan (sidney toler) meets former scotland yard investigator hugh drake (frederick worlock) on the same flight. now employed by military intelligence, drake is tracking paul narvo and his hindu servant, suspected for acts of sabotage around the world. drake believes that by contacting narvo's elusive wife, he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal.<br /><br />when drake winds up dead in the library of george kirby, president of the metropolitan aircraft corporation, charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called "tetrogene", administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken. summoning kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together, chan and police inspector vance (donald macbride) question those in attendance, as one of them may be the killer. among them are herbert fenton (melville cooper), a fellow oxford student of drake's, actress june preston (joan valerie), unknown to drake but requested by him to attend, ralph percy (kane richmond), the chief designer at kirby's aircraft company, and keith jeffrey (john sutton), kirby's stock broker. kirby butler boggs (leyland hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after number #2 son jimmy (victor sen yung) catches him steaming open a cablegram, the contents of which concern boggs himself.<br /><br />there are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well. mrs. narvo turns up as patricia west (marjorie weaver), and contrary to drake's suspicion that she might lead him to narvo, is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage. she's involved with david elliott (robert lowery), principal of a chemical research firm, and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angle.<br /><br />as with many chan films, racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings. this one offers two glaring ones. when kirby's black servant is brought in for questioning, he states that he doesn't know anything about drake's murder, that he's completely "in the dark". chan's response: "condition appear contagious".<br /><br />later, following inspector vance's order to round up all the hindu's in new york, jimmy chan comments on their arrival with "they're all beginning to look alike to me." actually, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, as shemp howard impersonates hindu mystic "the great rashid", but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist shorty mccoy.<br /><br />before the movie's over, two more victims fall to the clever narvo - his confederate ramullah, and aircraft magnate kirby himself. to uncover the killer, chan, in concert with elliott, arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed tr4 bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before. before it can release it's deadly poison, the brit fenton catches the falling capsule in mid-air, revealing that he knew about the plant. arrested and brought in for questioning, chan asserts that fenton is not narvo. the real narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous fenton, anxious to maintain narvo's secret. but chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real murderer - narvo now in the guise of stock broker jeffrey, having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident.<br /><br />now for the plot holes. when first investigating hugh drake's murder, it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests. however jeffrey/narvo was present at the dinner party. it had already been established that drake had one non party visitor in the library, chemist elliott. if the fingerprints really did not belong to narvo, then making them an issue was pointless.<br /><br />also, at the end of the film when narvo offers fenton the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness? but going even one better than that, how would a world traveling saboteur like narvo have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a new york city stockbroker, it just doesn't make sense. <br /><br />for trivia fans, a few more points bear mentioning. in the film, number #2 son jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to "pop's" aid to solve the case. in the prior chan film - "charlie chan at the wax museum" - jimmy was a law student.<br /><br />the poison gas formula would get reworked in a later chan film, this time by monogram with roland winters in the chan role in "docks of new orleans". in that story, poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its' victims.
