the movie ". . . and the earth did not swallow him," based on the book by tomas rivera, is an eye-opening movie for most people. it talks about the exploitation that migrant farmworkers go through in order to survive.<br /><br />sergio perez uses impressionistic techniques to depict rivera's story. he uses sienna and gray-scale effects to depict some of the scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they took place in the 1950s.<br /><br />perez also gives life to the film by using time-appropriate music, including balladeering and guitar playing.<br /><br />i feel that it is a good film to view because it shows in detail how migrant farmworkers live, what they do for entertainment, and their beliefs.
