this movie fully deserves to be one of the top hindi comedies ever made . rajkumar santoshi is mostly known for his gritty hard-hitting social dramas , but this is easily the most effortless movie he has made .<br /><br />the plot revolves around two small-town buffoons amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan) . they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city . they hatch the same plan separately - to woo a rich heiress raveena (raveena tandon) who is the daughter of a rich businessman ramgopal bajaj (paresh rawal) . thus the one who marries raveena gets his hands on all her wealth . but when they get to know each other's plan , there is an intense tussle of one-oneupmanship over who marries raveena . hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle rages on .<br /><br />at the same time ramgopal bajaj's identical twin brother shyamgopal bajaj wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune . add to this an assortment of funny characters including a raveena's maid karishma (karishma kapoor) , a mistake-prone butler named robert (vijoo khote) , a manager named bhalla (shehzad khan) who mimics yesteryear's villain ajeet and a funny gangster gogo (shakti kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a rollicking comedy awaits you .<br /><br />do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie . leave the company of your brains and just enjoy . the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes . dialogues (rajkumar santoshi , dilip shukla) are witty . music (tushar bhatia) and lyrics (majrooh sultanpuri) are memorable . the picturization and choreography (saroj khan) of "yeh raat aur yeh doori" , "ae lo ji sanam" and "dil karta hai tere paas aaoon" is fitting and will remain etched in my mind forever .<br /><br />the film starred two superstars-in-the-making , aamir khan and salman khan (they eventually became superstars) . aamir khan is impeccable in his first all-out comedy role . i salute his sense of comic timing . salman pales in comparison with aamir but is still likable . among the supporting characters , paresh rawal stands out in his dual role of ramgopal and shyamgopal .<br /><br />the movie surprisingly failed at the box office . i fail to understand why . i recommend it to all nevertheless .
