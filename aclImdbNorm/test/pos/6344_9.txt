this a wonderful sequel to the award winning lonesome dove miniseries in the 1980's. this sequel is perhaps, better than the original. it is definitely more family friendly. the language is more subdued. there is plenty of violence and one particular scene with cherokee jack is particularly gruesome. however, overall a great movie. the acting is superb. william peterson is fantastic. such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. jon voight aptly fills tommy lee jones' shoes as captain call. ricky shroder gives a great heart-filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. highly recommended.
