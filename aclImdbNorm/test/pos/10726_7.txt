i remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister. i was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory. an adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining. that is a mark of excellence. hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it. i like the billy put down the ice cream scene, and i remember the sctv version in there film i factory myself. remember joe flairty crying. please email me if you like the sctv skit. not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. touching and intertaining, i love the part where hoffman talks about killroy, and how the streets change. worth a second watch. 7/10
