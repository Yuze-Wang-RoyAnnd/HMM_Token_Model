i watched this movie, having never read the book, and took the characters at face value, but having already been introduced to them, watched it again recently. i got a whole different viewpoint out of the film.<br /><br />without the burden of having to focus intently on each character, learning their quirks and foibles, allowed me to focus on the cultural issues laid out in the film. the farm families of iowa are so intimately inter-related as they are in the area of indiana where i grew up in the 40's and 50's that i immediately recognized the back-stories and motives behind the characters. perhaps, jane smiley did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live, but viewers are so caught up in the "hollywood" aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes. another film with these characteristics is the "bridges of madison county". try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture.
