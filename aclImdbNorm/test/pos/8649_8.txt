in the beginning, with the careful, remote location and sweeking metal sound, i thought of the opening scene in "once upon a time in the west". when it gets to the city, then it begins to feels like "kitchen stories", or "drifting clouds", even possibly "grimm".<br /><br />then it turns out that this is more similar to "joe versus the volcano" in theme (not style). and the movie executes from beginning to end the same, understated style. letting you observe, take in the steel, blue-grayish tone of the suites, dresses, wall color, furniture, bedsheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people's expression. then near the end, there is one shot of a completely different tone - warm orangeish-yellow with soft music and ocean splashing, children and laughter.<br /><br />but maybe the observation is too long for me, i would much rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the ending shot. still beautifully done.
