i've often heard people express disappointment that mazursky's "tempest" has little to do with shakespeare's original. in my opinion, that is both true and false, but most of all, it's a bad starting point for offering critique. a work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't, but for what it is. the movie "tempest" is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play, but to my mind, it is faithful to shakespeare's work in spirit. what "tempest" is, then, is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. no, not experimental as in hand- held camera and mumbled dialogue, but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings. mazursky's tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyous, full of life, but most of all, it is imaginative. cassavetes portrayal of philip/prospero is in itself worth a 10/10 rating, and when you add gena rowlands, susan sarandon, a wonderfully deep molly ringwald, raul julia, the dialogue, the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture... i rest my case. one of the best movies of the 80's. don't miss it.
