will smith is perfectly endearing as the "relationship doctor," here to heal all your relationship woes.<br /><br />i expected this to be a standard romcom with little to amuse. i'm happy to report that i was wrong. will smith is delightful and unexpectedly "fresh" in this andy tennant vehicle. surrounded by a great supporting cast, an interesting story, and fed with witty dialog, i was thoroughly engaged.<br /><br />we found this one cute, quirky, and inspirational without being preachy.<br /><br />it rates a 7.4/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
