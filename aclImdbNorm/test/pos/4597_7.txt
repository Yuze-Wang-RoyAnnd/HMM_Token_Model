as social satire, idiocracy is just as good as office space, but with a wider scope. to criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point, i think. there are certainly fart jokes etc., but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience - they exist to define the state of "culture" in the world of 2500 ad visited by joe, as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes. the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives, and which should serve as a warning. my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news. the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at "smart" people, and average joes like the protagonists. note the times in the film when joe and rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them, and you realize that idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular, but on the culture of idiocy in general. i don't know what to say about the "made for conspiracy theory" behavior of fox in releasing this film, but if it's not playing in your local theater, demand it. we all need to see this film, if not for the social commentary, at least for the fart jokes...
