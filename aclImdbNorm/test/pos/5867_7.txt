when i was very young, my mother had a series of four looney tunes/merrie melodies shorts on tape and i watched them all several times. a coy decoy was one of these shorts, and i was truly shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned. when i was young i probably did not even understand the black beauty gag to begin with. still this is probably why it was banned, though until i watched this on a video site, i did not even remember the gag. upon viewing the video i did remember certain shots - in particular the shrinking of daffy's hat and daffy's eyes becoming clockworkish as the decoy circled him in the lake. i was not bothered by the gag that was most likely the reason the gag was banned. instead i was flooded with childhood memories of watching this short. because of how much i liked this short as a child, i rate it 7 out of 10.
