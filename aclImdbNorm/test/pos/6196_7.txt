smartly written, well acted, intense and suspenseful. this show lives in the real world, not as fantastical as is "24",(and i am a huge fan of 24,incidentally). it has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre. it tries to present both sides of islam. so far, i have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story to be more evenly balanced. the terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional. and as a result of that balance, the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains being portrayed in film and on television. last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon. i recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like.
