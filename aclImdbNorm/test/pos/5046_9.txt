this film just won the best film award at the cleveland international film festival. it's american title apparently is autumn spring. the acting is superb. the story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and spikes it up a little bit. abetted by his best friend (and partner in not-so-serious crime) he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold. his longsuffering wife has come to her wits end and makes a life-changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch. the resolution of the story is beautiful.
