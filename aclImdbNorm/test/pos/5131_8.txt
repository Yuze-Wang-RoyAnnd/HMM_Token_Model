saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids. a bit predictable. the book was better, gave more plot details, ore about the environment and how the kids uncovered the conspiracy. i think hiassen's warped humor comes across better in the book than the movie, but there were lots of funny moments in the movie as well. it is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 yrs of age. loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher. and those baby owls were adorable. i wonder how they managed to film them. the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best, made it look very appealing. am i imagining it, or did the author carl hiassen make a brief appearance?
