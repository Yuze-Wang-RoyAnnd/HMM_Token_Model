i would like to know if anyone know how i can get a copy of the movie, "that's the way of the world". it's been about 30 years since i've seen this movie, and i would like to see it again. earth wind & fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes. it was unfortunate that this group didn't take off like their counterparts in the early 70's, but as previously stated, racial tension existed in the united states which prohibited equalized exposure for the african american musical groups. it is good to see that earth wind & fire continuing their success. i would like to add this movie to my collection. someone please help me if possible. thank you for your attention. milton shaw
