i am finally seeing the el padrino movie, from what i can see it is an incredible film, and lots of action damian chapa is good director, but i must admit i love his acting the best.<br /><br />also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit.<br /><br />however the film el padrino is a pure 10 action epic. why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is? i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also.<br /><br />i am one of those people who love to see artists make it.<br /><br />b.s.
