in a critical scene, as katharine clifton (kristin scott thomas) lies in the cave of swimmers, she writes something read aloud by hana (juliette binoche) in which she proclaims that "the light has gone out now, and i'm writing in the darkness..." a sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome the english patient. with such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet, and a strength about the film that doesn't let up, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of world war ii, taking elements of casablanca and lawrence of arabia along with some independence in the form of tuscany.<br /><br />the english patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful... beautiful final act, and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting, it's the performance of ralph fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when count alm'asy, from the very start, proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character. usually typecast as a villain, he shows tainted, but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill.<br /><br />many will criticize this film based on its so called "glorification of adulterers", but those who do know nothing. the contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the start) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did, the evil that was once in him now absent, whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else. he wants this woman but he cannot have her, fiennes brings the human-like qualities out of alm'asy in a way absolutely no other actor could. there couldn't have been a better actor for the job.<br /><br />so please, take these comments to heart, see the film, those who call it "boring" or "despicable" know nothing, and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the film, a view that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably don't plan on correcting. the english patient is the best of every film to have ever won the best picture oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs.
