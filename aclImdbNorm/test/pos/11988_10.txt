the only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title!! please stop comparing it to the first! i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. if you haven't seen the movie and are curious, totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this. there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. this is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. i maintain, the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title. i usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. i dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship i can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'the stunt man.'<br /><br />robert stack- we love you!!!
