a stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid. it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual.<br /><br />love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humour and so many others things were so well captured. the 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter, tears, concern, joy and dismay.<br /><br />i approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives. it was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends.<br /><br />i loved it.
