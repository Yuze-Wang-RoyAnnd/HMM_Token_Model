i just watched this movie at the santo domingo international film festival. while watching the movie i had the feeling that i have seen a movie with a similar story before...a movie with ray liotta but i can't remember much of it. of course, this one is a lot more dramatic, especially at the end.<br /><br />this is the story: emilio's life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain. after 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go.<br /><br />watching emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing...the affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesn't. despite that the movie is still funny, exiting and involving. either it makes you want to help emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him. i liked the analogies, photography and the good performances.<br /><br />7.5 out of 10.
