i used to enjoy "happy ever after", but was absolutely hypnotised by "terry & june". with aunt lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between terry and june, a middle aged, middle class english couple, and i thoroughly enjoyed it, losing myself quite happily in each episode.<br /><br />the 1980s were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and terry and june certainly suited more traditional tastes. and mine - and i was a huge fan of "the young ones", too! each week, terry got into a silly situation and june got pulled in herself and usually ended up having to bail him out. how dated the shows seem now - it was a different world, but it's great fun to see trends of the 1980s featured - such as the cb radio storyline of 1982 (cb radio was legalised in england in november 1981), which saw terry imprisoned in his car in the back of a lorry! i've been watching the shows again recently on dvd, and i still think they're terrific! not loved by the enlightened elite - the chattering classes, but a huge hit with the masses! wonderful!
