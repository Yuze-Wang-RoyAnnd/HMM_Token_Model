"it's funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /><br />dark habour's characters, a married couple (alan rickman & polly hunter) and a vagabond (norman reedus), are slipping into a game full of hidden sexual energy and treason. now-and-then tantalizing breaks increase the tensions and give much space for interpretations. good acting and a story which, if not using the brain, will leave you in confusion. you have to watch it twice at least. the very strength lies in its unconventionality and in alan rickman, of course. those who love him will love this movie.<br /><br />conclusion: it is not a typical prime time movie but well done !
