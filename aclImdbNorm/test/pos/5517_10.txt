i enjoyed the film, and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material. i saw the film in a preview screening, and it wasn't ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending. the performances were quite good, especially andrew mccarthy in a more mature roll. i also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious, forboding air. i also enjoyed some of the "twists" in the plot, and don't want to give too much away in case other countries' video boxes don't give it all away! the script was a little over the top at times, but i appreciated the fact that the film-makers weren't afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling questisons regarding the roll of faith in our world. and, while some might find the ending a little too open-ended, i appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow. that's not how life works.
