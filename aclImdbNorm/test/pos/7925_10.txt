went looking for this movie after i read tom clancy's "red storm rising" novel. timeless masterpiece about 13th century russians being invaded by the germans. movie was made in 1938, under orders from joseph stalin to warn soviets about hitler and germany. battle scenes are wonderfully done, showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great fight scene. probably sergei eisenstein's greatest work. also see 'battleship potemkin'. any history buff or poli-sci major should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.
