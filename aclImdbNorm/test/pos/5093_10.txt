peter o'toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. i have seen the original version with robert donat and i much prefer peter o'toole's performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical. i've really never seen anything that mr. o'toole is in that i don't like. he is a brilliant actor, multi-talented, giving performances full of passion and depth. petula clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part. it is an all-around heartwarming movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. i will always remember (in para-phrase) the line where mr. chips regrets he has never given her children, and she replies, "of course you have, hundreds of them -- all boys." thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion.
