having read so much negative press on this movie over the years, i'd always avoided it, but the advent of the cheap public domain dvd encouraged me to finally give it a viewing. <br /><br />unfortunately, it's been transferred from a poor copy. the modern prequel, shot on tinted stock, is blurry and the contrast, non-existent. faces are occasionally difficult to make out. having said that, the actual story is entertaining and lou comes across as an accomplished actor, more so than in many of the boys' movies.<br /><br />once the movie switches to the 'jack' story, the film switches to 'colour' and i use that term loosely. most hues are orange or brown. the greens look particularly bad.<br /><br />dorothy ford as 'polly', the giant's maid, was a big plus for me as i enjoyed her in an early 'andy hardy' appearance.<br /><br />with so many negative comments put down to the actual quality of the print, i'm still happy to give this movie a 7. it gave me a lot of laughs and that's more than the greater majority of comedies i've watched over the decades can manage.<br /><br />one to watch if you get the chance.
