i absolutely loved this movie as a child. i can't seem to find it anywhere! i was mentioning it to some friends just the other day, and not a single one of them remembers it! can anyone help me out? my older sister vaguely remembers it. there was also another movie i remember that was half live action and half animation, but i can't remember the name of it. the characters were animated and the background was real...i seem to remember it being about a kangaroo, and i believe the setting of the film was in australia. i'm going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood. edit: i searched imdb for this other movie and found out it's called dot and the kangaroo! all i had to do was type in "kangaroo" in the search bar under characters, and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off! man, i love imdb! thanks!
