i laughed my ass off for an hour. i had no idea who dan finneity was. why haven't i heard of dan finnerty before? he's hysterical and so are his backup singers. they make all of these women songs that we would never wanna hear a new experience. they blow these songs away. this was on bravo last night. why isn't this dan guy like "ultra famous"? great voice! charisma to burn! he blew me away with this show! i just read on the internet that he was once a member of "stomp" i guess there isn't anything he can't do. i saw "stomp" at a ucla theater years ago and those guys were amazing. this show last night was done by dreamworks! does that mean that spielberg did this? why don't they star this dan finnerty in a movie. there was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera's cut to the audience, everyone was so into it, singing along or dancing. the whole show had this amazing energy. my only complaint was that it was not longer, but looking back, when you see how much energy these guys put out, i guess it would be impossible for any human being to perform with such gusto for over an hour. man i loved this show!
