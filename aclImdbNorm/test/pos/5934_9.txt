shawn michaels vs. edge-8- kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men, edge, whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring, and shawn michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs. heidenreich. casket match-2- ok, after a good opening match, now this, what a crappy match. undertaker has given some great matches at the royal rumble, and 1998's royal rumble against shawn michaels was the same type of match, but this is way worse then that match.<br /><br />kurt angle vs. big show vs. bradshaw. triple threat wwe championship-6- it's alright, i feel all three men could of given a better performance, this just really didn't show them at their best.<br /><br />randy orton vs. triple h. world heavyweight championship-9- triple h gets a clean win, can you believe it, sure he takes out the sledgehammer but doesn't use it. randy orton did great when acting like he got a concussion, but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous. i really liked this match, this was the best performance i've seen from hhh in forever.<br /><br />the royal rumble match-7- this was highly entertaining and i usually don't score the royal rumble match this high. the winner is again, very predictable, but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and guerrero are hilarious the best segments i've seen in a while.<br /><br />overall, this is a great ppv and a must own for wrestling fans.
