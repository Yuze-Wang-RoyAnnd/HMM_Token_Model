the first time i watched it was when it came out (1994), and the last time i watched it was just before writing this review.. it still makes me laugh my brains out...after all these years,it dose not disappoint. truly the smartest bollywood comedy ever made. this is one indian movie which deserves its place in the imdb top 250. aamir khan and salman khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles. the thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing...the jokes are refreshing and not cheap.. this is one film truly ahead of its time. if you haven't seen it yet go watch it now !!!!!!!!!
