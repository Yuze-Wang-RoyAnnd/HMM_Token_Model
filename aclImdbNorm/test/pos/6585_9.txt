this is another of those rare movies one feels grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual hollywood tripe. it really is a roller coaster ride, as we follow the effects of a a forged 500 euro note on a multitude of people. one asks 'what if' all the time but it certainly is a butterfly effect captured on film. it'll have you laughing, crying and biting your lip. i loved every minute of it! and thank you sbs australia for showing films that are truly entertaining, even worth the effort to read the subtitles. the only downside to my mind is that i wont be booking a holiday to the frozen land - they all seem to be far too depressed - must be all that cold weather. either way, watch it - it's worth every second.
