truly a great film... i stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because aaron eckhart (in the company of men and your friends and neighbors) was in it as well as paulina porizcova... the lovely former si swimsuit model does get nude in the film, but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it... it's very exciting, and the character development is fantastic... eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working, and he steals this film... it is very dark and violent, but i enjoyed in immensely....
