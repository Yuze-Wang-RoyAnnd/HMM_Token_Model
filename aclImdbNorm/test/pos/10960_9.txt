"shadows" is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for american independent cinema. whether thats true or not, it is an undeniably important film, one whose influence can be traced all the way to today's sundance fodder. here is a film which tackles controversial topics of the day (namely racism), and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative fashion. also, it deals with sex in a frank manner that hollywood wouldn't even discuss until "the graduate".<br /><br />still, the question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released? the answer is yes. while many important films are hard to watch and dated nowadays, "shadows" retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. it deals with racism as a personal issue and not a political one, so its still relevant. plus, it works as a great time capsule, capturing the 1950s beat generation and new york art scene in a way possibly no other film has.<br /><br />on a technical level, its admittedly uneven. cassavetes had yet to gain full confidence as a director and the choppy editing reflects the film's low budget. still, the film's story is remains powerful. plus, the acting, considering the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature, is phenomenal. all around, the actors create realistic characters, ones who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions. "shadows" is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs. (9/10)
