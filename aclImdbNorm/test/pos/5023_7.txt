warm hearted flic depicting arch-angel michael as a brawling, overweight, cigarette smoking slob who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex. he does have a good side, however, as he strives to set things right in the lives of a couple of burnt out losers before being recalled to heaven. funny, well played out film; very enjoyable although somewhat irreverent.
