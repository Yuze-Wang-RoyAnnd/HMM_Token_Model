if you're a fan of jackass, viva la bam or the cky videos, then you already know what you're in for. but this is one of those rare happenings when a sequel is better than the original! and man does this movie pack a mean low blow. but i mean that in a good way. it's the same type of death-defying, gut-wrenching insanity that we have all come to know and love and expect from bam, knoxville and co. but this time with even more laughs than ever before! with johnny knoxville's insane tolerance for pain, bam margera's love for harassing his friends/family and steve-o's gross-out factor, you have one hell of a funny film. the bar for the stunts, skits and general mayhem of the jackass crew has been raised. jackass 3? doubtful, because it's nearly impossible to improve on perfection.
