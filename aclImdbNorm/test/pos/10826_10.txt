when i went to see bon voyage, i expected a good, skillful multidrama on the order of grand hotel (1932) and les enfants de paradis (1944). it was better than that. with few exceptions, none of the characters were totally good or totally evil--just as in real life. the acting was wonderful, especially those who played fr'ed'eric, raoul, and camille. the photography was amazing, as it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in/around bordeaux during a time of new public works but managed the "look" of june 1940. costumes and make-up were accurate. there is so much in this movie that it's worth a second viewing. it's exciting, funny, and, ultimately, touching. n.b.--be sure to see it in a theatre with good quality projection. it's in wide-screen, and in the theater where i saw it (the clairmont in montclair) the first 30 minutes had the subtitles at the bottom in focus but the actors' faces slightly fuzzy! this was ultimately corrected but detracted from the pleasure of the film.
