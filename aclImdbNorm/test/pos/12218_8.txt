***spoilers*** whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, surface is superbly crafted. the cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art. conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans). close encounters of the third kind by way of creature from the black lagoon with a bit of jaws and godzilla thrown in for good measure, say. and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here. this series surfaced, seemingly, from out of nowhere and, by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling, carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season. all things considered, a job very well done. i only hope it resurfaces next season...
