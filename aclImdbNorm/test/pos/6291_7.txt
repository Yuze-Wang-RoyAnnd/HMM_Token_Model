i didn't expect much when i decided to watch this movie, so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it. a couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably. the characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. the fun of it comes from watching crawl (shore's character), a ditzy-yet-wise california dude a country college girl brings home for thanksgiving, trying in his awkward (yet endearing) way to fit in to their lifestyle. i was also surprised that in all this there was a message. if you have a chance, see this movie!
