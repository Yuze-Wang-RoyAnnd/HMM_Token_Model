i really loved seeing this movie. i think it's a brilliant, underrated alfred hitchcock movie. everyone is familiar with the famous statue of liberty scene, but there's a really great movie before that. robert cummings is great in what i consider to be his greatest role, and the beautiful priscilla lane shows that she has a lot of talent too. but i think norman lloyd gives the best performance. his character, fry, is so evil and devious. even though he's not in it for very long, the movie wouldn't be the same without him.<br /><br />"saboteur" is a great movie that every hitchcock fan should see. i give it a 10 out of 10!!
