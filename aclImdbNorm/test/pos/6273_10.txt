expectacular the ator's second part!! directed rapidly by joe d'amato, specialist in all kinds of subkinds(subgenres) of exploitation, and interpreted again by miles o'keeffe. the budget of the movie debio to be derisory or minimal. in spite of not being a better movie of his antecesora not mas entertained, ator 2 either, it has something, something that makes it enterteining. his introduction you prop it explains ator's origin to us with images of the first part. the script is incredible, is like any comic-book of the brilliant roy thomas. has so fantastic elements inside dle world of the sword and such fantasy as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant. the final this struggle very well. lacking mas violence and blood, but this one well. never it becomes boring. it has everything what there was lacking ator 1. be charmed with to my me!! 4/5
