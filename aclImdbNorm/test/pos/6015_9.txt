and i for one think that is a good thing. i've just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie. but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this.<br /><br />as for the rest of the production, i think it was slightly less than the original movie. one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice belting out "hey! it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah!" and although i missed it, i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy.<br /><br />i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage, it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre, not just at the movies.<br /><br />i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song "let me entertain you", which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it.
