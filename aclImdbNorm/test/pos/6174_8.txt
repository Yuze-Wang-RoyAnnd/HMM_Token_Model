i missed it at the cinema and have rented it on dvd. if you get the chance i would recommend it as it's better than nearly everything i've seen at the cinema or on dvd this year. that isn't to say it's one of the best films ever or anything, it's just i've seen a lot of rubbish :)<br /><br />can't really add to what's already been said except 8/10
