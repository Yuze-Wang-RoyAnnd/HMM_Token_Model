looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction? you just found it. this superb documentary about an aspiring feature filmmaker (mark bortchart) who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film i have ever seen -- probably because it's also one of the most tragic. oddly enough, the more i watch the film the more inspired i become.
