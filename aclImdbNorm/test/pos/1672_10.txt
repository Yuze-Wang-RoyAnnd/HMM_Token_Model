if the caper genre owes a lot to walter huston, it also has a debt of gratitude to jules dassin, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when edward dmytryk accused him of being a communist. the end of his american career would have meant the end of mr. dassin, but moving to europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his hollywood demise.<br /><br />"rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to mr. dassin's vision. he decided to adapt auguste le breton's novel because he saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic. jules dassin was penniless in paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film. the bad weather paid off for mr. dassin as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way.<br /><br />when we first meet tony, he is playing cards. tony appears to be in bad health; he coughs all the time and sweats profusely. after losing all his money, he goes to see jo, the swede, who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at maupin & webb, the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of paris. they pass the idea through mario, who suggests cesar, the milanese, an expert safe cracker.<br /><br />tony, who has come out of prison recently, learns that mado, his former lover is now with grutter, a creep that owns a night club. upon confronting mado, instead of love, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place. grutter has no love for tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection with mado.<br /><br />when the day arrives, the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor, right above the jewelry store, the owner lives, but he is away. everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. cesar, the milanese, a typical ladies' man, takes a ring as a souvenir, which in turn he gives the chanteuse at the grutter's night club. this tactical mistake is the spark which unravels the well thought plan.<br /><br />jean servais made an excellent tony. he showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery. carl mohner, robert manuel and the director, jules dassin, are seen as jo, mario and cesar, the quartet jewelry thieves. marie sabouret plays mado. marcel lupovici plays grutter with a subdued intensity. robert hussein, who would go to direct movies later on, makes an impression with his remi, one of grutter's men.<br /><br />the film best asset is the great camera work by philippe agostini, who captured the atmosphere of paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from. georges auric's music plays well with the action in the film. jules dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed, and unfortunately, that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with "the naked city", "night and the city" and "rififi".
