having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. good afternoon fare. i understand that louis jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential gorgeous suzy parker. everyone wanted to be in and i believe it has done well and held up over time. best on screen kiss between hope lange and the late stephen boyd.<br /><br />it may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment. i thought the movie was well cast except the awful acting of evans. what a grease ball but he found his niche someplace else. other than that, all stepped up to the plate.
