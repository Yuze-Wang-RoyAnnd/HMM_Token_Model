the retelling of a classic story is set to the music of burt bacharach and lyrics of hal david. the actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical shangra-la. it is a joy to watch bobby van, whose acting puts me in mind of red buttons, and, as always, george kennedy (cool-hand luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. <br /><br />the surprise here is charles boyer as the elder high lama. who would have known? <br /><br />all-star cast including michael york and olivia hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.
