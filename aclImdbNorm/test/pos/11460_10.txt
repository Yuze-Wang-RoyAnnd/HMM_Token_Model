i remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it. i happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age. first of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which i would term action/horror as opposed to psychological horror such as "the shining" or "the exorcist".<br /><br />furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods (or in this instance bad). the film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door. the film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have. if you compare nod to contemporary big budget horror films such as "i am legend" (the vincent price version was much better) this film really stands out. modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by cgi. most have no plot or character devel at all and are completely predictable. the special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. if this is 80s horror cheese i'll take it over 95% of current entries in the genre.<br /><br />on a closing note seeing nod again made me remember the beautiful jill terashita and wonder why i have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise. jill on the odd chance that you read this- i think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films. lastly, if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot.
