so keira knightly is in it...so automatically we compare this film to attonement. aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.<br /><br />the actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.<br /><br />if you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.<br /><br />this film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath. no its not exciting, but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters. at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie. we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible, and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief.<br /><br />there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster, if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not to judge them as actors but let them become people, you will truly ind yourself moved.<br /><br />go on!! give it a go!
