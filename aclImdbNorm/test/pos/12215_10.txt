someone asked why it was canceled i tell you why because "reality" makes money. the show surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a "reality" show, this will haunt nbc, i and about half of my high school, about 1000 people total have vowed to boycott nbc, until they bring this show back. in my area (i don't know about other places) but they had a great thing going with the sci-fi channel where the sci-fi channel would show last weeks episode at 7:00 and then nbc would show the week's new episode at 8:00 this was great because it gave you a little refresher as to what happened in the last episode. i was so angry when i learned that the show was canceled and they were going to just leave them on top of the church like that!
