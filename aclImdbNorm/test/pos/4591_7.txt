there is a lot wrong with this film. i will not lie. i will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick, and some bad hack job editing.<br /><br />this is not office space. do not go in expecting office space levels of comedy. it is very funny though. it is a mess, but very funny at the same time. a funny mess of a film. in the way that caddyshack is funny. a mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes.<br /><br />it works as a whole though, and it certainly deserves a wide release. this is the best commentary on the wal mart/ starbucks/ mtv nation you could hope for. the very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not, is great in my book. not very politically correct but worth at least some debate.
