i got a chance to talk with the co-creator, rebecca cammisa at the 2002 high falls film festival in rochester, ny. she said that her style is to be completely open and uninhibited in filmmaking but was very happy to be so severely constrained in the tight quarters of the group home. the narrow hallways and small rooms were expertly shot with a realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work.<br /><br />sister helen herself is a remarkable character, coming from tragedy in her own life to being an unusual combination of caring, tough, and street smart. the way the film introduces us to her past is excellent, spending only a few carefully selected minutes sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />in all, i can't begin to correctly heap on praise for this film. it really is a treasure of cinema and the subject a treasure of humanity.
