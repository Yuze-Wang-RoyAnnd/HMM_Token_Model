i rented this movie for two reasons. the first was all of the good things that i read about it. i definately was impressed, and couldn't agree more with all of the reviews i read. the second reason is because i know these guys. i don't know mark as well as i do mike. he hasn't changed much from the years we knew each other. i know him as "the reaper" from a local milwaukee radio station (wmse). the way he is in this film is genuinely mike 100%. he once gave me a table that he made. it was a little one, about 15" high, that said metallica on it. the odd thing about it was it only had two legs. sometimes it's the thought that counts, and mike always has thought about others first.
