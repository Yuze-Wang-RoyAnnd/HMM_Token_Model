werner herzog again explores the psyche of a man. in "little dieter...", we meet an effervescent, brilliant man who survived the war in bavaria seeing starvation and strange sights, moved to the u.s. and fulfilled his dream of being a flier. war, food, death, survival, hoarding, planes, heads coming off... how one american is born. herzog again sees madness as plane of existence and the surreal blends with the poignant as herzog himself narratives this psychic travelogue of a german becoming an american who flies prop planes in a late 20th century war where the culmination of technology, pilgrimage and eating out of garbage cans with spoons is melded with constant optimism into a man redefined into american. as always with herzog we are faced with florid madness, brilliance and what is man in the face of his own excesses, societal and personal. we laugh and cringe and are amazed at this man. where else for this man but america?
