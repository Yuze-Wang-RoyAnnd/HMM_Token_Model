i tend to get furious when hearing about lucio fulci's reputation as a director. too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. true, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream american production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. don't torture a duckling is yet another story! this film is a pure gem of the italian shock cinema! i easily dare to call this film a masterpiece
