this is the best 3-d experience disney has at their themeparks. this is certainly better than their original 1960's acid-trip film that was in it's place, is leagues better than "honey i shrunk the audience" (and far more fun), barely squeaks by the muppetvision 3-d movie at disney-mgm and can even beat the original 3-d "movie experience" captain eo. this film relives some of disney's greatest musical hits from aladdin, the little mermaid, and others, and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show. this is a totally kid-friendly movie too, unlike "honey..." and has more effects than the spectacular "muppetvision"
