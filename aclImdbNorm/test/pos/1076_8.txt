a very interesting documentary - certainly a lot more than sideways, a pseudo wino drama - where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. according to the documentary - and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on parker - only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world: robert parker of massachussets and michel rolland, a french wine industry expert based in bordeaux and also known as a "flying winemaker". the director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different regions of france, from sicily to argentina and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the mondavi family to uncover the wraps on the globalization of wine making and marketing. a must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made documentray.
