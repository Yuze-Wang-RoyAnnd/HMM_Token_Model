this is one of the best and moodiest vampire tales ever! i love this movie really. the character are great, even the locations and the story. indeed the picture isn't a big budget production, but it is absolutely worth seeing.<br /><br />ok there are some faults (especially the names of the castle and the locations) in this movie, but such mistakes are typically and are almost in every horror movie.<br /><br />the scenery fits perfect to the story and is close to reality,i can say that honest, because i visit them once when i was in romania in my vacations.<br /><br />in my opinion this is the best part of the subspecies series.
