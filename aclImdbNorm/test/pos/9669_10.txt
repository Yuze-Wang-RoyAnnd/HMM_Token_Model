ignore the comment before mine. the show is comic genius, most underrated show ever. 3 reasons why. reason 1, the flashbacks are hilarious, who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so hard it hurts and isn't that the idea of a good comedy programme? people who think this isn't funny just have no sense of humour. who cares if they are random, its a t.v. show, you can do what ever you like with it and people say its not realistic, neither is a cartoon, its animated. reason 2, the jokes are just generally hilarious, seth mcfarlane and the other writers are soooooooooooo funny, everything from the star wars references to making fun of celebrities, i love them all. and reason 3, the story lines are just brilliant and funny, they set up all of the jokes with their crazy nature and wackiness, just all the more funnier.<br /><br />i caught this one late night on bbc2 and have never gone back, i have all 7 seasons, plus the kind of movie thing (stewie griffin: the untold story), i have several t-shirts, posters and my collection is still growing. i've never got a collection of any tv show before but this was so funny i just had to get everything. <br /><br />just watch season 3 and trust me you will be hooked for life, the funniest show ever created and i hope it never ends!
