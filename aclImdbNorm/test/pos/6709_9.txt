a lot of people say the end did not make sense, but it did. with the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off, having picked up a lot of lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. enough to re-energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. it seems they do not have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. <br /><br />vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous, but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. all you can ask for is consistency. the viewer has to suspend disbelief, even for scifi. <br /><br />the only problem is having to be a sword or stake, not bullets. that puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci-fi. so that is a problem. <br /><br />the only major inconsistency i found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and carlsen go up to the ship. i assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown. <br /><br />what about all the humans killed? do their qui forces ("souls") go up to the ship as discrete entities, are does all the lifeforce get merged into one, for use as ship sees fit? in other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could be re-incarnated as bat creatures. <br /><br />the basic concept is no more ridiculous than star wars "force" or even re-incarnation. <br /><br />this movie was over the top, kitchen sink (dawn of the dead meets alien meets dracula), but in many ways profound. it was also a beautiful love story. the beginning and end were ethereal. it both began ("what is happening to me") and ended as a love story. <br /><br />most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.so what? bizarre is an art form. as far as being ludicrous, it all fits. the plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens just killing people. maybe they didn't need patrick steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very far out, surreal, scene. <br /><br />another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. but the end fits perfectly with the beginning. people are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core. its a lover story,from start to finish. it starts with carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. so it fits perfectly. most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is precisely why i love it. <br /><br />instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 of them going back to ship, to be reborn. way cooler than the hero kills monster end, but that is exactly why it bombed. it was not a straight-up horror or even scifi/horror at all, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and end. all those souls twinkling on the ship. and the crystal room pulsating with new life. <br /><br />most people can't deal with a love story that is also alien meets dawn of the dead meets dracula.
