showtime is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. the plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. but i laughed. a lot. credit goes to the inspired pairing of de niro and murphy. they have great chemistry. murphy delivers the one-liners, de niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. this movie will get a rush hour-like reception from the critics. don't listen to them. if you're a fan of de niro or murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.
