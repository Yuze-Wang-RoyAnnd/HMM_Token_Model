this movie deserves the 10 i'm giving it.<br /><br />but it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas' or 'psycho'. this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh,over and over again! it's the most horribly written and directed movie, yet it doesn't fail to entertain. it has the most amateur effects, yet you enjoy every moment! i saw this movie today on tv, and i didn't want to move away! read the following dialogue to know why!<br /><br />(whole college is standing around manisha,who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness)<br /><br />bad guy 1: please forgive us! <br /><br />bad guy 2: yes,we won't do it again. <br /><br />(no response from manisha) <br /><br />akshay: come on,forgive them! <br /><br />manisha: i don't know... <br /><br />akshay: you are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can get aroused by you! and these are living young males! don't blame them!<br /><br />pancholi: yeah manisha.. <br /><br />manisha(to suniel): what if they tried to rape your girlfriend??? <br /><br />suniel: i'd break their hands,legs and kill them.but anyways,just forgive them..<br /><br />akshay: yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty!<br /><br />now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! this movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! the bad guy (munish) can do basically anything..he can blow a sandstorm from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again. <br /><br />every actor takes turns to speak..one line from akshay,then from suniel, then from arshad, then aftab, then nigam. it's the main rule followed by the director, so that equal screen time is given to each guy. and then there's the all powerful pendant, which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed! all these things make it an enjoyable movie, and i can watch it over and over again. i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one..<br /><br />the only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny.
