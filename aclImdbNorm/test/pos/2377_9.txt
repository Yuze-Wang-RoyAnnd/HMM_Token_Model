ok, this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. no, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). the tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. the moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup. everything up to then is even less unequivocal.<br /><br />highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who don't mind following foie gras with a hot dog; caution to those with more refined palates.
