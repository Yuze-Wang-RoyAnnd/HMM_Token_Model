"back in the day" is an interesting, but flawed effort. ja rule stars as reggie cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. he meets his old friend j-bone (ving rhames) who tries to force reggie into a life of crime. reggie also falls in love with alica (tatyana ali) who is the preacher's daughter. now he has to choose: love or crime.<br /><br />ja rule does a competent job as reggie. at least he's trying to act. ving rhames is perfect as j-bone. he brings a lot of energy and menace into the role. joe morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self, but he doesn't do much. the same problem for giancarlo esposito as reggie's dad. he needed more screen time. i don't want to say this, but pam grier is pretty awful as mrs. cooper. she overacts every scene and brings the movie down. tia carrere and frank langella are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot.<br /><br />in the end: you should see it for the skilled performances of ving rhames and joe morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing.
