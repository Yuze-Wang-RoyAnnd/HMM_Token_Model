i have just seen a very original film that i would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' however, i guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `nurse betty.' renee zellweger stars as betty. she is a kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera. because of this, she goes on a journey to los angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover dr. rubell. to add fuel to the fire, she is also being chased by some ruthless `one life not to live' hitmen who think she has stolen their drugs. you could say that is how nurse betty spends `the days of her life' throughout the movie. this very `ungeneral' situation eventually leads her to the `hospital' set of her beloved soap opera. however, the only problem is that betty thinks this is all real. it is like her mind is in `another world.' ok! enough! i will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. i have already registered my vote for renee as a best actress oscar nominee. also, greg kinnear's performance as dr. rubell was as good as it gets in his acting biography. to sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for `nurse betty.' ***** excellent
