boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997. i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it. i'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance/disaster epic titanic again. the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow-minded the academy is. only atom egoyan's the sweet hereafter and robert zemeckis's contact came close to being as great as boogie nights. no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as tarantino's pulp fiction -- until now. paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. just as tarantino gave john travolta's career a kick, p.t. anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs. boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle, heather graham, and john reilly. overall, a wonderful film. the best since pulp fiction. maybe even better.
