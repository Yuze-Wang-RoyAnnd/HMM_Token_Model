why all the negative reviews??? you didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you??? what we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. not an oscar contender, just entertainment. you can really see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays. i still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new. crazy and scary thoughts when i saw this for the first time; i was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you. but, who's to say it can't happen??? i'm not the type of person to nitpick a movie to death, analyzing it until i'm blue in the face. that's not my style. average acting, suspensful and once again, very entertaining. sandra bullock as angela bennett is so cute. this is my favorite movie with her in it because she's like the computer genius, which i find very attractive. of all the movies that were released in 1995, this would have to be my favorite, although, i didn't see it until 1996. my rating, 9/10 because it did slow down a little.
