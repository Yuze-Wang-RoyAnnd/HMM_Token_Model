worth the admission price for the rock-off alone!! any d fan will love this movie (even though it's a tad short) and cameos from john c reilly, ben stiller, tim robbins, meatloaf and dave grohl (just about recognisable) prove that the d rock hard enough for anyone. even dio... the sasquatch/mushroom scene is going to become an instant classic (i don't want to say any more and be accused of putting spoilers in here). fans of the original hbo series will see a couple of nods to the d's early on-screen appearances in characters such as lee and the open mic host. i only wish that they had played a few of the songs from the first album and the omission of 'the government totally sucks' from the pod album is also a shame. other than that this movie rocks. obey the d!
