i saw this last night in fort lauderdale. in general it was funny and i liked the characters especially sabrina. the acting is good and the story line was ok except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like (what?) i wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better.<br /><br />the film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout. it has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for ash christian i thought it was good. you might want to wait for the dvd on this one. but if you get a chance to see it give it a shot
