i must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. but to start it off, i got "spanish judges" on february i think. it was mention it was the last copy, but as i see, it wasn't back-ordered. but either way, i have it. i thought it was good. i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, matthew lillard (i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. man, what a good actor.<br /><br />the story it about a con artist known as jack (matthew lillard) who "claims" to have merchandises called the spanish judges. if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, i won't even say what they are. i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. he needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, max and jamie (vincent d'onofrio and valeria golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece (mark boone junior). he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars, as she said. so they (mainly jack) call her "mars girl". everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. a game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal.<br /><br />there was some over acting in it (matt and valeria, as well as tamara, were not one of them). there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. some of the score was actually good. the theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? one more comment on matt: damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man.<br /><br />i know this is a review, but i need to make a correction towards necro, one of the reviewers: valeria golino is not a newcomer. according to this site, she has been acting since 1983. to me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as charlie sheen's italian love interest in both the "hot shots!" movies. but good review.<br /><br />although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good (which is why i gave it 10 stars above), i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it.<br /><br />8/10
