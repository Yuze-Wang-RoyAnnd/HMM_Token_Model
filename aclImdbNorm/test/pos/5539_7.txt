if you're looking for a not-so-serious mob movie, with a female as the lead, you're in the right place. pfieffer has acted much better than this. you can see she has matured beyond this picture.<br /><br />when i first picked this movie up, i expected pfeiffer was poorly miscast, however, she plays her mob wife role to the hilt. not a bad performance from baldwin, either.<br /><br />if you don't pay attention to the hair, you might enjoy this movie. but don't take it too seriously...
