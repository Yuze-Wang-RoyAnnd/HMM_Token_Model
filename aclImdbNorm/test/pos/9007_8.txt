the new voices scare me! kuzco doesn't have to pass some frickkin' academy to become emperor again! it's the same thing over and over, isn't it? this is a kids' show, right? yzma turns kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. he learns a lesson. everything is the same!!!!! david spade and john goodman never returned... *sniffle*! nothing changes 'cause disney won't do anything 'bout it. it's probably one of the most retarded shows ever! the first movie was so damn better! malina's probably the only person i like. kuzco's such a crybaby! kronk is retarded! and yzma's retarded-er (if that's even a word)! what i meant to say is... how could you, disney... why?
