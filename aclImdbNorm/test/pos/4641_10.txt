midnight madness is a movie that is unfortunately highly underrated and unappreciated. with a flood of classic "edgy" teen/college movies, this one was forgotten. as a child i would watch this movie over and over again, luckily i had it on video. this movie shows a more tame, but most exciting side of the eighties. in the cynical society we live in this day and age, with drug abuse being the "coolest" thing, it's good to see, once in awhile, a fun, innocent movie that is midnight madness...that is if you can find it.
