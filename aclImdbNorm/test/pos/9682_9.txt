"family guy" is probably the most ballsy sitcom ever produced. it relentlessly skewers everything it can think of, from tv shows to family drama. best of all, it's one of the few tv shows on today that's actually funny.<br /><br />the show revolves around the griffins: peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, even though peter considers himself to be that. chris, the fat teenage son who has just as few brains as his dad. meg, the black sheep of the family that is the but of everyone's jokes. stewie, the baby who has plans for killing his mother and taking over the world. and brian, the family dog, who is frequently the voice of reason, but is frequently corrupted.<br /><br />"family guy" employs many tactics to get laughs from the audience. most notable are the frequent cutaways that spoof what has just been said. they are effective because of the impeccable timing, and in how they play out. "family guy" uses spoofs to get humor as well, most commonly from 80's tv shows. what really makes the show so great is that a person doesn't have to be familiar with what it's spoofing. i'm sure it would help, but the material is funny enough in its own right. but the show doesn't stop there. not only does it spoof just about everything, it skewers its own spoofs! the show is filled with off-color humor. the only reason why people aren't up in arms about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race, sex and other generality equally. there is nothing sacred here, and no one and nothing is immune from "family guy's" satirical jabs.<br /><br />putting on musical numbers in a film takes a lot of time and effort, and it's a very big risk. but "family guy" contains some great songs. all well-written and performed, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous one, "the freakin' fcc" is both catchy, and hysterical because it hits the ratings board where it hurts).<br /><br />the voice characterizations are right on the money. seth mcfarlane is tremendously talented. he provides the voices for peter, brian (which is his own natural voice), and stewie. not only are the voices consistent and creative, he can alter their pitch at will, so it really seems as if they are spoken by three different actors. alex borstein brings a nasally drawl to lois that is perfect for the character. seth green is unrecognizable as chris (had i not looked on imdb, i would have never known that it was him). lacey chabert originated the character of meg, and while she was good, mila kunis really elevated the character with her sharp voice. kunis gives meg a new, sharper edge that she didn't have with chabert.<br /><br />"family guy" has been compared to "the simpsons," and that's entirely understandable (and not just because they are produced by fox). both are satires of blue-collar life, and while "the simpsons" is good, "family guy" contains are sharper edge. the show is utterly fearless. there is no real sacred cow. the show lampoons handicaps (physical and mental), ethnicities, tv shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including s&m), and some that's just beyond description. not everything "family guy" throws at the audience works, but as a whole, the show is consistently amusing and frequently hilarious.<br /><br />if there's any flaw with "family guy," it's that the jokes run on far too long sometimes. particularly with the "awkward moment" jokes, the sequences are stretched for so long that not only does it cease to become funny, it becomes so irritating (and long) that a fast-forward button is warranted. these can be effective at about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes stretches these to beyond two minutes. one could argue that the show rewrites its rules to suit the plot, and it often does (for example, brian frequently acts like a person, but he still acts like a dog when the story requires it). but that's not a problem because the show still works.<br /><br />some people have argued that the show has stopped being funny. while i agree that it's not as edgy as it used to be, i think the blame lies with fox, not mcfarlane and his crew. the show originated with fox, but after some lackluster ratings and viewer turnout, it was canceled. however, dvd sales were large enough for it to be picked up by adult swim. the show became an instant success, and it was once again bought by fox. however, because the show is so big now, fox is afraid to let the writers experiment and try new things. while it's still funny, the humor is not as fresh and edgy.<br /><br />definitely check this show out. it's awesome.
