man with the screaming brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but i'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where yegor and william battle for control of william's body, is straight out of evil dead ii). there are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, "what are you looking at?!" the movie looks like a sci-fi channel original, probably because it was. the acting is actually pretty good. i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. ted raimi handled the standard "bumbling assistant" role admirably enough, and bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending american jerk. (now that he's writing his own films, you'd think he'd give himself a role that he hasn't been typecast in already.) man with the screaming brain is a bizarre, nonsensical b-movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.
