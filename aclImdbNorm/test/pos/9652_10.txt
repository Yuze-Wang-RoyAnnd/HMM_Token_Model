this is the best french movie of the year ! i saw it twice and i found it great both times. i didn't think it boring at all even though it is very long (3 hours). i'm seventeen so i obviously didn't get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in french history, but it doesn't really matter since i still really enjoyed the film. it's actually quite universal : people of my parents' age can identify to the characters and so can people my age. garrel seems to perfectly understand young people, the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world. maybe that's because the character played by louis garrel (his son)is actually meant to represent philippe garrel himself. well anyway, great movie, no action (have to be honest on that point) but so strong feelings that you can't possibly stay indifferent to it. if you're looking for a relaxing sunday-evening movie, don't waste your time on this, you'll be disappointed. but if you like cinema, you'll like les amants r'eguliers which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50's and 60's by the nouvelle vague artists.
