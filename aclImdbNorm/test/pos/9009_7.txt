spin-offs, for somebody who don't know, are not usually successful because most of the original characters are absent.<br /><br />here they are and you couldn't ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon, not meant to do anything but entertain.<br /><br />j. p. manoux, replacing david spade, does an admirable job of retaining kuzco's ego and yet not seem as annoying as spade's character (a character spade has done for decades and gets on one's nerves after a while). he has a softer voice but it fits somehow.<br /><br />eartha kitt, reprising her part as yzma, is brilliant. she hasn't really been given much accolades since her turn as batwoman centuries ago, except maybe for her vile part in boomerang. it's funny how much the character looks like her, though.<br /><br />and patrick warburton. there is no way that he can't be funny, except when he was thoroughly wasted in men in black 2. i have been a fan of his since seinfeld but unlike that character, he plays a genuine likable guy who is sucked into doing not so nice things.<br /><br />the animation is really beautiful as all disney usually is but sometimes the character design is a little too sugarcoated. oh, well. two out of three ain't bad.
