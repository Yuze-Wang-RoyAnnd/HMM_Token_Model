this is a very touching movie. this is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. a villager (arun nalawade) brings his grandson, parashuram, to the city to get his eyes treated. but comes to know that parashuram (aswin chitale) has some rare cancer of eyes and has to undergo an operation and will lose both his eyes. the movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing. the movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. though the movie is in marathi, language is not a barrier at all.it proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs, superstars and usual masala. excellent performances. this is india's entry for oscars 2004. hope it gets the nomination at least. would rate 10/10.
