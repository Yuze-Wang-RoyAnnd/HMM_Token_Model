part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeare's classic plays, this version of hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of shakespeare's most over-rated plays and hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. i feel no sympathy for him, and i didn't after watching this.<br /><br />even when you have great actors like the great derek jacobi in the role of the dane, and patrick stewart as claudius and jonathan hyde as rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. and when a good actor like jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible. i just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying, and this killed it for me. that said, he does get the "to be, or not to be" speech right, as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play.<br /><br />the supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably lalla ward's loopy ophelia and stewart's well-detailed interpretation of claudius.<br /><br />at four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks. check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch.
