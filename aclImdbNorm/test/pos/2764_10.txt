i saw this flick on the big screen as a kid and loved it -- cheeziness and all. recently, i found a copy on video and checked it out again. badly made, sure... schlocky fun, most definitely. it still packs an entertaining punch. it's much more fun than the dull disney version ("alive"). the only thing "alive" did better were the special effects. if you're a lover of b-movies, i highly recommend "survive", not to mention all the other rene cardona jnr movies... and the mexican wrestling flicks made by his father (rene cardona snr). "survive" is long overdue for dvd special edition treatment. are you listening, all you kind folk, at anchor bay...?
