i blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and i dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob. absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />a great effort on the part of ann margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off. the role really deserved an oscar.<br /><br />you truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system. <br /><br />if you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
