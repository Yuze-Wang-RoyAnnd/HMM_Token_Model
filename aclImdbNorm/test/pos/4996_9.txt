what has hurt this film is everyone and their aunt matilda is comparing it to its illustrious predecessor, which is always going to hurt any show. if you take it as a western, it's a darned good show. we discover how our characters in 'lonesome dove' wind up in the situations they start up in (such as: why do two texas rangers, who live on adventure, wind up in a dead town? and how did gus manage to lose the love of his life?) the performances are very good, and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road. the actors did a very good job. the cinematography was superb, and while the music didn't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past, that was an impossible task, and it was still fine.<br /><br />it also helped that we had three episodes, which you just don't see in a miniseries anymore. heck, it's downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these days.<br /><br />fans of the western, rejoice!
