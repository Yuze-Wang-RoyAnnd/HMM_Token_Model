i'm czech and soldiers (not only pilots) who escaped czechoslovakia after nazi's invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me. this movie from director of academy award winner "kolya" (1996) is a tribute to these men. it's first big-screen movie about czechoslovak wwii soldiers since "nebesti jezdci" (1968). i think "dark blue world" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music etc. movie is half in english and some actors are britons. but greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence. it's great chance to show people all around the world (and to many people in czech republic too...) that czechoslovak role in wwii was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign.<br /><br />leading characters are older and wiser frantisek and young karel. they escaped together from czechoslovakia, they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman... maybe it's a clich'e but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including great dogfights). i don't want to compare "dark blue world" with "pearl harbor", someone will like ph more and someone will like dbw. but if you like happy ends, dbw is not for you. so, i think it's very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of czechoslovak history.<br /><br />btw, main theme "dark blue world" is from czech 30's and 40's composer jaroslav jezek. he wrote this theme when he lost his eyes...
