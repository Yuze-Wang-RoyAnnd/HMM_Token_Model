this film, an early william wellman, has an important message, particularly today. it posits the notion that sometimes there are things more important than your own personal safty or well-being. the film, which has walter huston as the lead, is stolen by the performance of "chic" sales as grampa. he's the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch. you'll recognize some familiar faces if you watch many movies from the '20's and '30's. wel worh your time to watch if you get the opportunity. recommended.
