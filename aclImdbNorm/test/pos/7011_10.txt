it's funny how time went by and never saw this movie...'till last week, when i was like under a spell. i saw it twice in a week and it still wasn't enough. it's a great movie and i will love to see it again. the story is great and it really moved me. i would love to live such a story. the actors are great, the music too and you can dream about your own love story. i just hope that someday i will find the opportunity to learn to dance like johnny and baby. i feel like dance connects people and brings them together. i think people should learn to dance...it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. it's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
