i thought this was a great action flick. a very good role for geena davis. she is a very versatile actress. one of my favs next to angelina jolie. i actually watched the long kiss goodnight right after seeing the new tomb raider movie. it got me thinking, charlie or lara? which one would win in a fight??? either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. especially when they're kicking butt. i just hope to see geena in another film soon. seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long. it would be especially nice to see her in another film with samuel l. jackson. now they make a great duo. watch this film if you haven't. you won't be disappointed.
