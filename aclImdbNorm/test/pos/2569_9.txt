this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. sex and love. women's emotional abuse of men, men's physical abuse of women, sexual child abuse, fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.<br /><br />i promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect. music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant.<br /><br />and the dvd has some great features, including samuel jackson's background of learning to play guitar and feel the blues.<br /><br />this movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers.
