any movie that has a line of dialogue that goes something like this...."judy's getting ready for her date, butthole!" has to be good! i found this on dvd unrated, unedited and was pleasantly surprised, a lot of hard work was put into making this movie. i actually enjoyed this more that a lot of 80s movies i have seen. great addition to my movie collection.<br /><br />the buildup was great, sets up the scares for the rest of the movie. loved the gore and the t&a. i never thought eyeballs being gouged out would look like popping boils, the color of the eye splatter was gross! i keep thinking that "rog" looked like tiger woods but more black, anyone agree?
