this movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art, which is good. but it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting. i think if i wrote it i could do without the drama surrounding the wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning minnie driver's character. i think that all too often hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when, with an adult themed movie such as this, the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable too. overall, it's a very well done offering and well worth seeing.
