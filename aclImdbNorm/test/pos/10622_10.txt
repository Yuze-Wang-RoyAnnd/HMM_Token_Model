this movies made me suffer and i loved it! loved it! it haunted me for days. i think erika is the kind of character you simultaneously loathe and lament. the most terrifying sex scene ever caught on film. this is the best of haneke's work so far. he is the only living director to redefine pace since kubrick. the violence in this film is gorgeous. in a word, the film is about self-hatred. in a sentence, the film is about trying to find love in order to stop hating yourself and finding that that is a hopeless hope.
