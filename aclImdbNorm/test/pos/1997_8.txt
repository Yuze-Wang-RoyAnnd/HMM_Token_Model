i've watched the movie actually several times. and what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the burak altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. not even those silly model named deniz akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie... burak is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through. even though this is kind of horror movie, he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too. i bet most of you all saw asmali konak the movie and tv series, those two would go for an example... all i'm gonna say is you better watch out for the new works coming out from burak then you'll see.. keep the good work bro, much love..
