the 1970s opened the door to the largest, most diverse era of film in the history. some films were great ("the godfather", "the conversation", "mean streets", chinatown", "the french connection", "five easy pieces", "jaws", "mccabe and mrs. miller") others were not so great ("the getaway", "the outfit", "badge 373", "joe", "the taking of pelham one two three", "brewster mccloud", "castle keep") and others were barely worth the price of admission.<br /><br />yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to today's corporate hollywood. where every film is given a big weekend to recoup its cost. or go straight to hbo and rental.<br /><br />what "decade" does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film. perhaps personal. perhaps not. sometime with a clutch of extras. sometimes, in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up. long before the corporate overseers, suits, committees and lawyers ever became part of "the system".<br /><br />the commentaries are superb. especially julie christie and dennis hopper. though as you listen, you'll slowly discover just how many big directors today (coppola, scorsese, ron howard, dennis hopper, peter bogdonovitch) got stated as "roger corman commandos". working long hours with short pay. shooting a film in under a month. learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves. turning in product that was on-time and under-budget.<br /><br />see "decade" for its message. and for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those wondrously turbulent years.<br /><br />though, i would not complain if ifc decided to devote another documentary solely to that most under-rated grand pioneer of film, roger corman.
