...the world may never know. (the film that did take the "best animated short" oscar that year, "anna and bella", is very good, but it's no "big snit". both are available on expanded entertainment's "world's greatest animation" compilation, in case you'd like to compare.)<br /><br />"snit" and its director, richard condie, have attracted so much attention that there's little for me to add. i'd like to note, however, that the film contains one of my very favorite single "shots" in an animated short, the one where the man opens the door to let the cat out. i don't want to give away the actual events depicted here, but the first time i saw the shot i was whipsawed from one mood to another, then seconds later to still another. that shot has never failed to affect me that way since. for this shot, and for the way condie builds up to that set of moments, "the big snit" deserves the tag of "masterpiece".
