the simpsons of course started off with christmas special "simpson's roasting on an open fire" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to bart mending his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates. the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out. overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the character's exactly as they became 20 years later. so watch this episode in a pack of season 1 and enjoy early simpson's doing what it was meant to, making people laugh. i rate this episode 73%.
