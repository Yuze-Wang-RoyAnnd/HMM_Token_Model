john parrish is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the wilkison's over at anchor. the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully parrish and his workers, he has a change of heart, particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worse.<br /><br />originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration, chiefly because of the cast that was involved. when you got edward g. robinson, glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie, you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel. sadly they don't get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple revisits, or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice?. well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture. i think yes it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from, it is, when all is said and done, a plot that has been milked for all it's worth, and then some. but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production.<br /><br />glenn ford as parrish is as cool as an eskimo's nose throughout, and it's always great to see babs stanwyck playing a bitch because she's good at it. while eddie g, when one gets used to him being in a western, is fine in what is an under written part. robinson, who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee wilkison, broderick crawford got injured, is the one who is short changed the most by the makers, even supporting characters such as the devilish wade matlock {a grinning delight from the reliable richard jaeckel} and judith wilkison {a radiant dianne foster} get something to leave an impression with. but for what it is, robinson's crutch toting "bad" guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons.<br /><br />not shy on action and gun play, it's with the twists and almost shakespearean tragedies that rudolph mat'e's film rises above the mundane, with all of it gorgeously framed by burnett guffey's stunning cinematography. lone pine in alabama has been used on many a western picture {see seven men from now for another glorious use of it}, but here guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn. the violent men isn't a great western picture, and perhaps a better director than mat'e could have really given donald hamilton's {the big country} novel an adaptation to be proud of. but for every niggle and irk i personally had with it, i found two more reasons to actually really like it, so that it be, it's recommended, for sure. 7/10
