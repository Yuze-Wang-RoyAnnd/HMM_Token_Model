to me, "anatomie" is certainly one of the better movies i have seen. i don't think "anatomie" was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science. if you watch it with that in mind, it turns into a really good film. the only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the english version. how can you expect any non-german person to listen to these unbearable german accents for two hours? let native english speakers do the talking or use subtitles instead!!
