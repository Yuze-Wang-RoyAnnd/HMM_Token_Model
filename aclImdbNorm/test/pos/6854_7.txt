i liked this film a lot. the actors were great, particularly potente, who is different in every role; f"urmann, who is also able to play anyone; and loos, who spices things up (she is also a talented singer - she sings the song "my truth", heard when one character cranks up the stereo in the lab).<br /><br />anatomie is a good horror flick, which pays attention to its characters. it is also very gory at times, and the set design is innovative. it is too bad they had to make a sequel, which is nowhere near the original.<br /><br />on a side note, two other things definitely worth mentioning. the dvd is not dubbed, which makes for a better experience of the film. also, make sure to keep watching after the final credits start rolling.
