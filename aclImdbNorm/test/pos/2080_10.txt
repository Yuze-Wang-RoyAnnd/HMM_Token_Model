i've seen various hamlets, and i've taught the play. as i watch jacobi, i'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. he deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding hamlet's character. he illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. at the same time, however, we cringe at the horror hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else. and we shudder at hamlet's own betrayals, because jacobi is not afraid of the baseness to which hamlet can descend. in short, jacobi gives us hamlet in full, and hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature. that's why i'm satisfied that jacobi's hamlet is the finest performance i've seen by an actor.
