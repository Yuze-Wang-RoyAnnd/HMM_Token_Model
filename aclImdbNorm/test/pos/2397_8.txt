i was very impressed with what eddie monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me. i say this because i know this independent film had a limited budget/resources, but despite this, it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of work.<br /><br />enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which i can't help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come, eddie monroe didn't fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing. it's a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard.<br /><br />many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future. someone told me that paul regina recently passed, and if this is true it's a real tragedy since his stoic performance in eddie monroe is remarkable.<br /><br />kudos to fred carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one!
