i cant see how some people cant find this film funny i saw the end of it on sky movies in 2001 thought i would by the dvd since then i have laughed my balls of with lines like rik mayalls laugh "hahahahahahaha" and eddies "hello night porter" when they never get any phone calls overall i think this film is very very funny.
