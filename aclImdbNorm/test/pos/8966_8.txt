charlie wilson (two time oscar-winner:tom hanks) is a easy-going congressman... who loves to party, enjoys the company of woman and especially drinking his booze. when charlie's old friend and ex-girlfriend joanne herring (oscar-winner:julia roberts) wants charlie to visit afghanistan, which that country certainly need of help. charlie is shocked of what he seen, especially from all different ages are killed or hurt from this war with the russians. he decides to help the people and the rebels to fight the russians, who started the war. charlie, joanne and one renegade cia agent by the name of gust avrakotos (oscar-winner:philip seymour hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the largest covert operation in history.<br /><br />directed by oscar-winner:mike nichols (the birdcage, regarding henry, wolf) made an lively, entertaining sharp satire war comedy that is based on a true story. hanks, roberts, hoffman in a oscar nominated performance and amy adams as charlie's loyal assistant are very good in their roles. despite the excellent true-life premise, "charlie wilson's war" never really catches fire and it is not as wickedly funny as you liked it to be. director nichols and screenwriter:aaron sorkin (a few good men) keeps things moving and the characters are well liked throughout.<br /><br />dvd has an sharp pan & scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd's only special features are the behind the scenes featurette with the cast & crew and a real-life featurette with charlie wilson and others. "charlie wilson's war" is a good movie that could have been really great but it's not. but this movie is smart enough to please for those, who enjoyed well written or well acted adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
