of course i am going to think it was a great movie. i recognized several people i didn't see during filming also. i was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. i also changed this one scene. they had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. the director said "it is taking to long, what would you do gower." i said, "we need to go in and hook the arms and drag him out backwards. that way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set." i also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the assistant warden of security. i am also a current employee with the tennessee deaprtment of corrections as a supervisor at the riverbend maximum security institution. even though a lot of the movie was a joke, the part i was in was reality enough. also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper i use to work with at a club called "the classic cat".
