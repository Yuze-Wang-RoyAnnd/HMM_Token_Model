i cannot believe how perfect this movie is. great cg graphics, good storyline, and the fights, oh the fights!!! this movie was great!! the characters. they look real enough to be considered real. they definitely resemble the ones from the game perfectly. the scene in which....well all the scenes, made my jaw drop. fantastic 10/10 graphics the story. perfectly explained. plus the way aeris comes to help cloud at many different times in the movie. they explain it very well, and make your jaw drop from how perfect it is. but the repetitive fights do take some story out, but that is only a minor thing. story 9.5/10 everything else, great. the movie was just amazing. i really do not know what more i can say except that this movie was pretty much perfect. i loved it!!!
