i haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and i have been searching for it since. at the time i was 12 and the story excited me; and now, the ending eludes me. it was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention john's vocals and taupin's lyrics. the story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. i am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run. if this movie didn't excite your curiosity, then you were just too old. i look forward to seeing it again (even at my age)! if nostalgia is in your venue, i'm sure this is an interesting movie to see. it's innocence is simply astounding and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable.
