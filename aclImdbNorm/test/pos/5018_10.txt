it's a movie with a theatrical message blended with some clever moments. films like these are the stretching grounds of great actors, they enjoy tossing the ball in open pieces like these. the angel that wasn't what we see in old books and churches is quite a nice change. it is echoed in kevin smith's piece, dogma, almost in the same slapstick vein.<br /><br />-=0) watch this film for a good day after you suck it all in. could it be that so many films are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this? possibly one of the most fun pieces i have seen in a while, i ran into this one on vhs in a trash can because someone's basement was flooded this summer, and i grabbed a handful of tapes.<br /><br />whether in a trash bin, or on the silver screen, mild comedies like this are fun, you just don't have to tell everyone at a hip nightclub that you like it, or a swank political party. just keep it for yourself, and i'll bet plenty of people will borrow it from time to time.
