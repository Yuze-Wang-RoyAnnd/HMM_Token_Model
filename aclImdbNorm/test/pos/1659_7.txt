this 1955 heist film follows tony le stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. he teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, cesar from milan (played by jules dassin, who also directed. he only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the u.s. and couldn't work in hollywood.) the brilliance of this film is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. during all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe. this increases the suspense and draws you in. they get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels, but a jewel offered to a dancer by cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. they set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake. great heist/gangster movie, but i prefer j.-p. melville's films in this genre.<br /><br />this movie is like some lemonade i had last night. i had gone to a caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar. it also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons, leaving it fairly sour (which i like). the sugar cane juice imparted a subtle, slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar, and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as i sucked it down. 7.5/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
