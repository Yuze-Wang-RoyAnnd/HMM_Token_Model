often considered argento's last "great" film, this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it (though i have yet to see "mother of tears"), but to call it his last "great" film might be stretching it a bit.<br /><br />the directorial and stylistic flourishes - the hallmark of all argento films - is indeed present, with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best (the "peephole" sequence is especially memorable), and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding (the fluorescent lighting is beautiful).<br /><br />however, the narrative - which is hit and miss in all of argento's films - is missing here. there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences, with one following the another, leaving no real time to fully construct a right, focused mystery to be solved. all of this results in a climax that is... well... anti-climatic, as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly care.<br /><br />regardless, this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes. i wouldn't' recommend this as a starting point for argento's films, however (for that, i would recommend either "deep red" or "suspiria"), but if you enjoyed those, or even any giallo, then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire.
