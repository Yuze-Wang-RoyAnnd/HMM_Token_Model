this isn't the video nasty night of the demon as there are more than one. actually, there is only one, but it multiplies.<br /><br />after it inhabits suzanne (scream queen linnea quigley), she passes it on to goth girl angela (amelia kinkade) through a nice long kiss.<br /><br />next, we see linnea showing us her quigleys in the bathroom. she shows a lot more as jay (lance fenton) thinks he is in for some fun.<br /><br />soon, everything literally goes to hell as bodies drop one by one and are possessed. judy (cathy podewell) and max (philip tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. max isn't much help, leaving it to judy to figure a way out.<br /><br />the makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept this from being even better was the extremely long build up to the action.<br /><br />the old man (harold ayer) who appears in the beginning will be back and get his just desserts.<br /><br />linnea quigley may be the scream queen, but cathy podewell definitely showed the greatest lungs in this film.
