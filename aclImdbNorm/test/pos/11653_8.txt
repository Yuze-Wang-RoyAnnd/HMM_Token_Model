this is the most human and humane of movies that i have seen in a long time. the ironies abound, susan sarandon as a nun, tim robbins and susan sarandon in a movie that doesn't preach but neither does it condemn. it is cinema verite at it's best, and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events.<br /><br />which of the two is more amazing, sarandon or penn? it is easy to say who is more likeable, but it is hard to say who is more convincing. they are simply magnificent.<br /><br />you may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful. whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider.<br /><br />at the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect. that is what great drama does, it gives catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
