since the plot like vertigo or brian depalma's obsession, till to the score by peter chase that reminds the sounds of bernard herrmann, this little pearl seems to be sight from fews. remarkable playing by romane boeringer and vincent cassel in a bohemian paris portrayed from the famous thierry arbogast. a little cult! it is a pity that the only version available on dvd are the french one and the english. directed by a controversial artist as gilles mimouni, it could be considered a little homage to the cinema masterworks. it is a french movie, and as all of them, not for all, we could say a d'essai cinema. even if not so publicized, it could be remembered for several reason.
