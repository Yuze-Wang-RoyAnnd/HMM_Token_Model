the outer limits is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me with very strong emotions. there are, undoubtedly, some stinker-episodes, but it's essentially an old pulp-comic turned into a tv-show, so that can be expected. for the most part it's excellently done, well produced and directed, and often featuring some big-name talent who seem to enjoy working in a solid translation of short fiction to hour long television format.<br /><br />the outer limits tends to focus on rather large ethical/philosophical/moral questions and rarely ends without the voice-over intciting serious thought.<br /><br />from time-to-time, the themes are hammered in a little bit too heavily for all but the most thick-headed viewers. additionally, while a certain level of distrust of the government is conducive to an effective democracy, you can unluckily catch several episodes back-to-back that border on the absurd with regards to distrust of the army/cia, etc. one further note is that any large group with power (the roman catholic church, evangelicals, the people's republic of china, and so on) are cast in a bad light in frequency ranging from once to often.<br /><br />while the show can beat a dead horse if it's watched enough, the overall quality is astounding, and i'm grateful that sci-fi has decided to continue airing it until they produce a season-by-season dvd set (and i can afford it.
