i have watched every version of this play that i can think of, including several on the stage, and sir derek jacobi is absolutely the best hamlet i have ever seen! <br /><br />he has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. the way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. he (as hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life. you believe that he is in pain, you believe that he is angry, you believe that he is not a little mad. you believe he is hamlet.<br /><br />of course, some of the thanks obviously goes to shakespeare, :) but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage, it doesn't really matter how well written a play is.<br /><br />if you like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. if you don't like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. you will come away with a new appreciation for shakespeare if you do. the nuanced performance that sir derek gives will leave you breathless.
