i caught this show a few times when i was young and it was playing tilt, my parents loved it and now in syndication i feel what they feel. this show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. this show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.<br /><br />i still cannot believe jonathan glassner and brad wright did this. those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. the show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. this is what was not there in the new twilight zone. rod serling coming in added to the scariness, forest coming in lightened the mood. <br /><br />the ending whether good or bad made for a scary time. you could never predict what was going to happen. i am still trying to find the seasons on dvd.
