this film is a great comedy drama. christopher walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager, and his commentary will keep you laughing. robin williams plays a great role as a quick wit "jon stewart" and will amuse you if you are fans of comedy central. the show is good, because if the viewer has half-a-brain, they will see it as a very needed sub-cultural attack on the policies of the current republican government and a criticism on the american democratic process..., not to mention the means by which most politicians get elected.<br /><br />i was amused at the sub-plots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining, without any of the usual "oh-brother's" i would agree the film is less comedy than marketed, however, without question better than 90% of the garbage in theatres at present. just my thoughts...don
