i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. since then i've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when i ordered it from moviehunter. sorry to say it doesn't hold up. this glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. i love burt bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and i even bought a cd of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. just doesn't fit. michael york is lost here. sally kellerman tosses off a fine performance but olivia hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the himalayas. the best performance is charles boyer as the head lama.
