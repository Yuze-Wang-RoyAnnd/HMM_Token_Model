saw the movie last night w/o knowing anything about it (nothing else out seemed interesting and i had a buffalo connection to this movie - ub grad). it was a very enjoyable movie. liked the pace (it picks up after a slow beginning) and story. well written plot and good character development and relationships. highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see movies that have interesting stories. found myself talking about this movie afterwards over a few beers - most discussions don't last more than a few minutes.
