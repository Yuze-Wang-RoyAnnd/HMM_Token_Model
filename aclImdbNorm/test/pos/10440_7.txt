reality before reality tv? copy of "fast times at ridgemont high"? a precursor to "say anything" that's grittier? i can't decide, but the soundtrack *is* the 80's--blondie, journey, reo speedwagon, devo, lionel richie, and u2--i can't believe this, they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today.<br /><br />i remembered this like a teenager--mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism. why? i was a horny teenager in the 80's. watching it again, i just can't describe how much i love that rose, play by kimberly richardson, turns out to be the voice of "pepper ann" in the 90's, and she was almost 30 when she was in last american virgin, playing alongside 16 year-olds--fantastic! complete cheese, reality, fantasy, and comedy--with a sincere cherry on top.
