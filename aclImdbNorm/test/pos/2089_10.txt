a great film. every moment masterfully conducted by toyoda and his crew. the actors give credible performances all around.the visuals are haunting,beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the japanese country and city landscapes.the sounds,courtesy of japanese band 'dig', are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. it's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on. <br /><br />all in all, they worked everything out perfectly....well, if they were to give any justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. <br /><br />the real greatness of 9 souls is the compelling story. the prison break movie maybe something of a lost genre these days, and road trip movie losing it's appeal due to the way the world is getting smaller. but this story easily mixes something fresh to those two genres.<br /><br />9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society. will society accept them? will they be truly free of their dark pasts? and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /><br />each convict has an interesting history. their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates. a sense of brotherhood among them keeps the story high on drama and supplies it with hilariously comedic situations. and due to the nature of their backgrounds, violence is always something waiting to happen.<br /><br />after all that, all i can say is go give it a watch.
