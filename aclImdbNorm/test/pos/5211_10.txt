for the main criticisms of the movie... the love story: that wasn't a love story. those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone. the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy. it added a feminine touch, but come on look at american movies...no where close to love story. there was no storyline: does war have a storyline? i think that is a silly criticism. the storyline is this. they start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died. death is the ultimate end to any story. just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline. <br /><br />there was a horrid truth in this movie. i wouldn't necessarily call it "anti-war". it had a political statement of course, but the movie wasn't all about the politics. in fact, except for a few occurrences when the captain? showed up, there was never a stifling air of nazi germany. they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party. the fat cats weren't gonna go into russia!<br /><br />maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit, but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier (i'd say exactly of almost any nationality and war)and what they must go through. it was a losing battle, of course the movie is going to be depressing. and to the person who said that it was gutsy (and silly) to even portray germans as victims: there are victims on all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you that).<br /><br />this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary. a few problems with it when arguing for just one, but it instills the best of both worlds. watch it as such. beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically, emotionally.<br /><br />i'm waiting til they make a movie about iraq. it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, i want to see who has the guts to do it first. (jarhead doesn't count)
