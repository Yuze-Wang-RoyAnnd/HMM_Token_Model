i saw this movie yesterday night and it was one of the best made for tv films i've seen. it was very well directed and the acting was superb, very convincing. the music was good and the cinematography was beautifully shot. take out the hopelessness out of requiem for a dream and you get wasted. an excellent depiction of the world of drug addiction and its consequences given in a very open way in wich anyone can relate to. cudos to mtv for giving us a good flick for a change from !*$*% like crossroads.
