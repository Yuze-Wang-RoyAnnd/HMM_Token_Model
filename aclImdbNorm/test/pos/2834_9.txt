gregory peck and gig young are competing for the same girl and after peck sends young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. feeling guilty, peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the indians. peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, ward bond, lon chaney jr., neville brand among others, are excellent. the script is derived from a novel by charles marquis warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer. the idea of using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later including "the dirty dozen" made in 1967.
