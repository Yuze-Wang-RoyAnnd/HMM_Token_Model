i'm totally agree with garryjohal from singapore's comments about this film. quotation: 'yes non-singaporean's can't see what's the big deal about this film. some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually 'get' it.' it's still not quite the truth and as a malaysian-chinese, i do 'get it' although i don't speak hokkien because we do have the similar 'problems' in malaysia too. i know that it's really hard to understand and to accept this as a reality but it is definitely not a 'no real story'. i was pleased to see this film outside malaysia because it will and definitely be banned in malaysia too. which means either you get it in 'illegal copied vcds or dvds' or hope that someone to be kind enough to 'share' it in the internet. this is not an 'another violent teen drama.......' because it portrays the reality which exists in singapore (and in malaysia too) in an interesting way (sad+humour). i was just a little sad to know that this film got about 20 cuts in censorship. what a waste!
