most of the brigitte bardot movies i've seen have failed to take full advantage of her captivating screen presence. unfortunately, she was given few really good roles in movies of undeniable quality, which was a real oversight. she deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way. as genevieve in "love on a pillow" we had a clear exception to the trend of light, fluffy vehicles, for it was an interesting, artistic film by any reasonable measure, and in it, a 28-year-old bb was at her most alluring. "une parisienne" is another, featuring an extremely captivating brigitte in an interesting, well-crafted comedy that explores how an ambitious lady's man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife. there are several good performances here. her playboy husband, michel, is one, "the prince," played by charles boyer, is another, with entertaining efforts by a good supporting cast. as for brigitte bardot, the way she looks in this movie is the way i remember her as a kid in the fifties. she was 23 in 1957 and way ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress of the period, including marilyn monroe. her curvy, coquettish sexuality, amply displayed in several bosom-baring, skintight dresses, simply jumps off the screen. she was more hip and cute than the women of america are today, nearly fifty years later. obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics, they come off like a bunch of clueless lesbians. in stark contrast, the sex kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent, and clearly independent long before it was fashionable, yet while fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity, she used it for a higher purpose than mere self-interest -- she believed in love. a still photo simply could not do her justice. you had to watch her slender yet voluptuous form (with its 20-inch waist) lightly cross a room. you had to see that wild blonde mane, gaze into her big, brown, seductive eyes, and listen as her full, pouting lips spoke french. in a closeup at the end of this movie she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful orbs twinkling. what a babe! for fans of brigitte bardot, "une parisienne" is not to be missed.
