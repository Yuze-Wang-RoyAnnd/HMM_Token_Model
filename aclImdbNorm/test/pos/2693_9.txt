this is one of the funniest shows on tv today. it hits the mark 99% of the time. usually after watching a sitcom after a few years, the actors become to cartoonish, as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play. these actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles. the chemistry is still there, the writing has not gone down and i still look forward to watching it. the family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season it is one of the few shows i watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching.
