bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct american animation company, filmation on the back of he-man: masters of the universe and she-ra: princess of power, in 1983 and 87' respectively. the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall bravestarr, who possesses the strength of the bear, ears of the wolf, speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk, and his trusty sidekick, a talking horse named thirty- thirty, who carried with him a gun aptly titled, 'sarah jane' and with the help of deputy fuzz and judge j.b serve to protect new texas from the evil tex hex and his band of outlaws.<br /><br />set in futuristic texas, this was and still is to this day, one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city, in the us- hence in the south- thousands of light years ahead in the future. considering this was made in the 80s, the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a sci-fi based outlook. bravestarr didn't just evoke morality and good verses bad, as well as teaching children lessons about life, but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldn't take things and life for granted. and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon, many of the story lines, themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. in addition, marshall bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a (ethnic)minority background, to make an impact on tv.<br /><br />the sound effects were amazing, the music was great, the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong. something of which the same cannot be said about today's cartoons, sadly.<br /><br />whilst bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of he-man, it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics. suffice to say, i preferred bravestarr over he-man because of the diversity of the story lines, characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves, were more what i would say realistic and identifiable in contrast. for some reason, they resonated more with people because like for instance,in 'the pledge' where a kid dies from a drug overdose, the fact that there wasn't a happy ending was important- in the sense that when kids watch that episode, well, in fact anyone who watches that episode, will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs.<br /><br />bold, brave and at times thought-provoking, bravestarr is definitely that- bold, brave and thought provoking. a cult cartoon classic for many years to come, it dared to take some risks, but it had well and truly paid off in the end. it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever, and rightly so<br /><br />8 and a half out of ten
