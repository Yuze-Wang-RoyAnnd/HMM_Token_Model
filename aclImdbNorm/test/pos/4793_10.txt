the topic of religion in bu~nuel films is a point that one, as an eater of films, as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly. one can see to a satirical bu~nuel in "la voie lact'ee", "un chien andalou" or in "l'age d'or". is very hard and effective in its critic, but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like "nazarin", after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author. and much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for bu~nuel thinks, but is better not called in this way, i think that there's not any contradiction in its work, only that bu~nuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films.<br /><br />this beautiful film is based on the novel of benito perez gald'os, which told us the story of father nazario, who lived a humble, simple life dedicated to god and to help everyone. he lived in a simple and poor region. there lived too beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned wife. she don't find any sense of her life without her violent, macho man. she have a kind of repulse to him. in the other side is andara, one of the towns prostitutes. father nazario has been stolen again, he blames to andara's cousin. andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest, who don't believe in violence. that night, andara find that her cousin is actually a thief, she have stole her bellboys. andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. with this, andara search mercy from the priest. nazario decides to help her, knowing well that this could be against his church, obviously this thing going to have some consequences. since here, nazario going to be a pilgrim. without nothing, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. but andara and beatriz want to be with he, and be like he, to serve god.<br /><br />if is the sweetest bu~nuel film that i have seen so far, is too the most spiritual. is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here, we don't see a bu~nuel against the power of church, we see a bu~nuel whose film is about church but not in the typical - and great - satirical way. whethever like it is, i don't think that the right word is contradiction, actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues (as his "voie lact'ee") i found it more a spiritual film but that don't try to touch in diversity the catholic religion as maybe he touch, and laugh of it in another films. "nazarin" is of father nazario and its perspective front god and the same religion but all of this is at the end, analyzed in the spiritual life of this man.<br /><br />the other two women are, not a contrast, but as very well another two perspectives of faith. first we have beatriz, the mistreated woman, that lose all the faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. this little girl was very sick. at side of her was too andara, the prostitute who run of the justice. in the family of the child, just religious women, there a big pain, but faith becomes in father nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town. he bless the child, a say later she is fine. the priest want go on walking, but beatriz and andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to god with father nazario. after some complains, father nazario decide to be with them, discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith, god, religion and the person in necessity, the people who must request to charity to survive. this last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending. this ending we listen the drums (similar to that in "l'age d'or) and a father nazario, walking over asking about this things, when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe, as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest. meanwhile, the two women must take away of the father, andara for its crime (beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail) and beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man, in spite that he treat her bad, just because she don't accept that she fall in loved with the priest. father nazario - and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church- walk to contradict the church, the religion that he serves.<br /><br />father nazario is that then, is a (soft for much, but not for me) critic for some thing in religion (father nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime, of a sin) but most of all is one of bu~nuel analysis of faith and life, and he really got it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and unforgettable film, that is, without a doubt, one of his best.<br /><br />*sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.
