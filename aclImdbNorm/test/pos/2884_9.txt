in dramatising wilde's novel, john osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown dorian's essential wickedness. if you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson's "dr. jekyll and mr. hyde", but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas rls took the scientific route. both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end.<br /><br />the actors in this bbc movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders, in his role really projecting wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. you'll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying, but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. peter firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don't get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display.<br /><br />it's a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications.
