on its surface, this is one of the most classically entertaining action/comedy/romance films i've seen in a long time, reminding me of pleasurable old "saturday-afternoon" movies that had just the right balance of unexpected twists, well-timed humor and integrated action. beyond this, though, there is our knowledge of this film's context. it has the same elements of "casablanca," but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behavior. this adds a strong note of irony to the humor (we sense that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future). this is a film that you will not regret watching.
