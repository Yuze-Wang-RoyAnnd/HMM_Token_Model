many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting, casting and styling of this film. it appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral question (euthanasia).<br /><br />this film is, bar the final scenes, meticulous in stressing ramon's belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that, for him, a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living. we, as viewers, see an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for its physical limitations, a life fully lived. central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that ramon's life is not worth living - and that is him.<br /><br />to watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense. the priest's visit is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the spanish catholic church's response to the issue of euthanasia. however, the sister's parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful 'pro-life' sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film. we are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love. as the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision. <br /><br />i do not remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this.
