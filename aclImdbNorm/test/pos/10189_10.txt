i recently visited the magic kingdom as an adult with my mom, her best friend and my adult sister. disney world is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just children, but when you see quality shows like mickey's philharmagic, you realize that the magic of disney is for everyone! it was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again. and then a third time. it was absolutely breathtaking. i would encourage anyone who goes to disney world to check out this show, which is not just a show but a world wind, fun filled ride with donald as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble!
