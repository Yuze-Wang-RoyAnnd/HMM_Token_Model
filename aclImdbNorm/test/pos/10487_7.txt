price of honor aka price of power is an ambitious western melodrama, light on the action, which seeks to tell an old west version of the jfk assassination. in 1881, the president travels to dallas and is shot from a window while parading thru town in his carriage. corrupt officials have carried out the murder and have a humble slave take the rap. our hero, the earnest but bland giuliano gemma, aims to unravel the conspiracy. an engaging story, audacious for its subject matter, but entertaining despite the paucity of shoot-em-up action. the film is a 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the dvd, which is overly dark with poor sound. look for a good copy.
