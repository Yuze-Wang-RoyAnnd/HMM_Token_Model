the dreams of karim hussain are to be feared. when the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment, and various abominations are released. religion won't save you, nor will mother nature or your own family. hussain's dark poetry, because that's what this film really is, destabalizes all institutions of sanctuary.<br /><br />`subconcious cruelty' is a current crowd pleaser on the horror\fantasy festival circuit. the film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. the protagonist's desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic. from here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackles mother nature. hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness. nature is exposed as blood-drenched and violent in hussain's frightening enlightenment.<br /><br />`subconcious cruelty' is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life, lust and madness this very worthy film explores. cj goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up, as do david kristian for unnerving sound design and teruhiko suzuki for score.
