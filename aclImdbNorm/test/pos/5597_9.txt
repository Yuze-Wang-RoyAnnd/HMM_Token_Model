this film is probably hal hartley's best one. the subject, of a unusual originality, is treated (that's usual with hal hartley) with great humor. this characteristic isn't at all the only quality of this film: the fussy frame composition (everything is parallel, until the smallest details), shooting angles, lighting, giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images (jesus' coming down couldn't be filmed in a conventional way), the falsely "poser" acting, are qualities that make this bible re-reading, carried out in the form of an apocalyptic delirium, essential.
