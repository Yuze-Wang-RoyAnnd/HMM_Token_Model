i thought nick gomez's look at the gritty streets of new jersey, where car-jackings are at an all-time high, was both thought-provoking and entertaining. this is just as good as movies like boyz n the hood or menace ii society or above the rim. i thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable, it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric, whether on purpose or by raw coincidence. i liked this movie a lot, an underrated gem i found on tv and glad i caught it. go watch this movie if you get a shot. if they don't have a dvd, they should release one. well done nick gomez. imdb rating: 5.9. my rating: 9/10
