john carpenter's the thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. what makes the movie so great? it's hard to put my finger on it. everything just seems to work in the thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place. the film is even superior to alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell. the fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films. a truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.
