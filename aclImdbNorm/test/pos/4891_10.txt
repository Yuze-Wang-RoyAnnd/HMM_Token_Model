as an american fan of the league of gentlemen i had to wait months to finally see this film when it came out on dvd, but it was well worth the (excruciating) wait. "apocalypse" is fantastic- funny, freaky, clever as hell, full of in-jokes and cryptic references to the television series; basically everything you'd expect from the gentlemen.<br /><br />the plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so i won't bother re-capping it, although i will say when i first read it i was a bit hesitant. obviously this device- fictional characters entering the real world to confront their makers- has been used before, notably in wes craven's underrated "new nightmare" and stephen king's "dark tower" books (where king himself was a character). the gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall, though, and even add a new element: a second fictional world ("them days"). soon all three realities have weaved together, and the result is exhilarating: geoff tipps being knighted in the middle ages (and trying to court queen victoria wood); the real league of gentlemen in royston vasey, being confronted by characters like pauline and dr. chinnery; david warner summoning an homunculus outside of bernice's church. i've heard that some people disliked the "king's evil" sub-plot, but i found it hilarious, especially reece's character (who seemed to be channeling judith the "witch" from series three).<br /><br />speaking of the characters, i was relieved to find that, although hilary briss, geoff, and herr lipp were planted firmly in at the film's core, other, more familiar characters were given their due. bernice's confessional in the beginning was hilarious, hearkening back to the quicker, more sketch-oriented feel of the first series. pauline and mickey have cameos (no ross though- strange), although i would've loved to've seen more of ms. campbell-jones. papa lazarou is accounted for, as are tubbs and edward. all three are used very sparingly, giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel (and just what the hell did papa hack up, like an obscene hairball? according to the dvd commentary, a "wad of greasy pubic hair").<br /><br />the film looks incredible, but then, what's new? the music, as always, is breathtaking. i was thrilled to hear joby talbot's new interpretations of the theme music, and his slight re-working of the majestic, lovely piece that closes out both "apocalypse" and the last episode of series three.<br /><br />i have some minor complaints- it would have been nice to see more of the old, familiar royston vasey, and i felt the stop-motion creatures (beautiful, by the way) were a bit underused. both of these issues, however, can be justified by the film's budget, so they're understandable. still, as much as i loved bernice's new church, it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street (the gentlemen's original vision, according to the commentary).<br /><br />overall, "apocalypse" is astounding, especially if you're a fan of the series. i can't recommend it highly enough. 10/10.
