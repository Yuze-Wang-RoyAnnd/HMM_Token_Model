unlike some of the former commentators, i was (and am) an avid fan of the carpenters. face it, christmas would never be christmas without the carpenters. that said, i believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting karen's life. the movie was enjoyable to see on primetime tv, but the content fell a little short. i suggest that you all look into getting some of the carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. you cannot believe how awesome a drummer karen was. cynthia did not capture the extent of karen's talent. also, karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. my choice for playing karen is hilary swank. i would love to see a more substantive story, because there was more to karen than meets the eyes when listening to we've only just begun. i have tons of unreleased carpenters' music, and it is absolutely excellent. (her singing of california dreamin is to die for).
