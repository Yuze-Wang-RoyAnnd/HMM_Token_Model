what to say about a movie like rock star? a lot actually! this is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam. it is also a movie i, as a major hard rock fan enjoyed-no-loved actually-while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic. oh well....<br /><br />i loved this movie-and would see it again and again-but i know that's purely based on my own personal tastes-rock star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. it was a great time for metal heads. and it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that(long forgot by many non-rock fans.) time effectively, as i think that rock star has done. that is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. you will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that? as far as setting the atmosphere rock star gets a 10 of 10. it also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. if you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past, then this is the movie for you. it is also the reason why i loved this movie so.<br /><br />but it isn't a great movie. i understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally, i'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one. the problem with rock star is the character development.<br /><br />what is wrong with the character development is this, there isn't any. none. the movie has certain scenes-few and far between but they are there-that do touch on greatness:warning brief scene spoilers: 3 examples- 1)when izzy makes his debut on stage(including the fall he takes)<br /><br />2)the first "after show" party with emily(anniston and izzy.)<br /><br />3)backtracking a little-in the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole "business as usual" tone sets the stage for what's to come. it's played very effectively.<br /><br />but the problem is, nothing ever does come. there is little to no character development of anyone in this movie, peoples' persona's are merely touched on, but never fully explored. i don't think that's the fault of the actors/actresses,particularly anniston who tries hard, they just are not given much to work with. it's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the "formula" feel into true movie depth. rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. and , though, those scenes i mentioned were outstanding and very believable, sadly much else in the movie wasn't.<br /><br />another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and i agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about anything. why does izzy leave at the end? because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? it tests the limits of believability. and, frankly the end was just corny. made no sense and had no reality to it at all.<br /><br />watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said: ok, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. by the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. and you wonder why so much detail is left out....<br /><br />i hope i'm not being to hard on rock star because i truly loved it-but not for the right reasons. i would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. instead i loved it for it's 80's period feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life.... although many others loved it to, i suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan, like i did or some who play. i'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good, well told movie, instead of a clich'e. i think, one of the problems was the length. i myself, hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is done really right, the length is not even felt-there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was-that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />so-to wind down-this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie. see it for fun. see it for entertainment. see it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it was life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.
