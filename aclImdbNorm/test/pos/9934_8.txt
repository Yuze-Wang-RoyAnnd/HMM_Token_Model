after the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young understudy, betty, is brought to the forefront. that's very lucky for her, with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch. what is his connection to the opera, and what is his fascination with betty? <br /><br />i love dario argento with every part of my body. and i'm not an orthodox fan, i think. many people, particularly critics, praise his earlier work ("suspiria" and "deep red") but really frown on later films, such as "sleepless", which i liked. my favorite, "phenomena", is usually vastly underrated. "opera" tends to fall somewhere in between. some consider it one of his last great films, others see it as part of his so-called decline. i loved it.<br /><br />the picture is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics, i love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is someone i can feel for (not unlike jennifer connelly from "phenomena"). and the imagery... wonderful. great cinematography, and some amazing kill scenes. the concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink... brilliant. my assistant tina thinks this looked fake, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. and some great effects, like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? awesome.<br /><br />jim harper calls the film "stunning" and calls attention to the "innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders." i agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. mike mayo likewise calls it "visually fascinating eye-candy" and lauds the "crisp editing and flowing camera-work". it's really a wonder that this is not one of argento's more highly-praised works.<br /><br />argento returned to the opera with "phantom of the opera", which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter asia and julian sands. even more interesting, this same year offered the release of michele soavi's "stagefright", which (like "opera") has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation. both are great films, with soavi's more on the slasher side. (soavi actually served as second unit director on "opera"... you can make your own conclusions.) <br /><br />my only complaint with this film is the length and pacing. while it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. the first one takes over a half hour, and then we get down times between them. the lead actress should be in constant terror, but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again. not cool, dario. we need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.
