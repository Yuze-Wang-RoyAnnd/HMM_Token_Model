spike feresten is a comic genius. 'talkshow' demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like letterman and the daily show successful. his likability is palpable. he seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable sitcom path...thank god. his comedy is reminiscent of the award winning arrested development (cross your fingers that 'talkshow' has a longer life span). the topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else, yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around. i particularly enjoyed the sketches..."unfair target" will be a cult classic in no time. set your tivo's people...this is a show not to be missed.
