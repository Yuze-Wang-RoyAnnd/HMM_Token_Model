this movie is truly worth seeing - robin tunney excels and henry thomas proves that he's one of those rarities, the child 'actor' who grows up to become a real actor. the characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they could have been unconvincing - but all the actors are simply astounding. the cast of this movie has to rank up there with that of "girl, interrupted" (both movies coincidentally star the brilliant clea duvall). the score and music selections fit perfectly, and there is plenty of action to prevent the movie becoming just a character study. if you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but i will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.
