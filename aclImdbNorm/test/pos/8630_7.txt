i wanted to see this movie because i am a very huge abbott and costello fan, and when i saw it, i liked it.<br /><br />this movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. i mean i laughed at a lot of the funny parts and i just plain enjoyed it.<br /><br />though it is not of the best of the perfect straight man and the perfect buffoon, you should see this if you really love abbott and costello.<br /><br />out of all of the abbott and costello movies that i have seen, i can't say i've seen one that i hated. this is decent, funny, and entertaining. abbott and costello at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years.<br /><br />all in all, i liked this movie, it is not one of their best ones, but i liked it.<br /><br />7/10
