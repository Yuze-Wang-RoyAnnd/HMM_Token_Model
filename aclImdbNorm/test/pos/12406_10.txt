the efficacy of this picture was best proven on the intended target audience, namely teens. my 14-year-old son became so engrossed in this film that i rate it considerably higher than its imitator "mad city." it sparked debate in our household on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty vs. doing the right thing. for that alone, i rate this film a 10! parents should watch it with their teens and discuss it afterwards.<br /><br />i very much liked the smart dialogue and consistent acting. i thought that james remar was adequate in his role, but the teenage cast really carried this picture. other imdb users have praised corey feldman's performance, which truly is inspired. all in all, i give this picture my highest recommendation. go get this one!
