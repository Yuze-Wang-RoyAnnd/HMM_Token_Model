i consider myself a huge horror movie fan. one night i wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of. then, i rented milo. i was so surprised by this movie. it scared the hell outta me. that's not something i can say very often. usually halloween only scares me.<br /><br />two other friends watched it with me, and were left with a disturbed feeling. a good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. if you are unaffected, then what's the point.<br /><br />this movie was original. it didn't follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. that's why movies like valentine bombed for me.<br /><br />of course, many are left with unanswered questions, as most horror movies do. it is worth the rent though.
