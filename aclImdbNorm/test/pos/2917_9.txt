having read all of the comments on this film i am still amazed at fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in dvd. yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, but it was the 2nd film by fox made in real cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. i saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things egyptian, culminating in my visiting egypt 4 years ago! amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh? in high school i read the book and made a promise to myself to one day take that dream trip. now, true this film was made in the "old school" style, meaning that egyptians were portrayed by pink skinned and blue-eyed brits. however, has anyone seen the current hbo series "rome"? everything old is olde again. one can't imagine why in this day and age we are still casting actors mincing around as mayfair aristocrats in roman drag. not one actor on rome could pass for an ancient italian. that being said, the amarna period in egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. this film is immensely appealing ( to borrow a word from nefer) for its historical information (beer! brain surgery! iron!) and its gorgeous cinematography and score. i have a dreadful taiwan dvd version which i watch over and over again praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available. for anyone else interested in this subject i highly recommend the historical novel "a god against the gods" by the author of advise and consent. if anyone of you film buffs out there knows how to contact fox to urge them on, please let me know!
