before i'd seen this movie i've heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how "horrific" it was. not to take any credit away from this movie, i think it wasn't all that horrible or even shocking. it's just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town. and a good one at portraying the point.<br /><br />there's some great acting here and a well-thought of manuscript. paavo westerberg is a renowned writer in the finnish movie scene and he's the best in what comes to describing the contemporary finnish culture (albeit he's not the only one writer for this movie, but i dare say he's the main-writer anyway. correct me if i'm wrong).<br /><br />the casting is excellent, except for jasper p"a"akk"onen (the pseudo-main character, who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene), and the sets, the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie.<br /><br />this movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous finnish band's very well known song (eppu normaali's "tuhansien murheellisten laulujen maa", which very roughly translated to "paha maa") throughout the whole finnish society lead to a sad, dark end accompanied with booze, lonesomeness and the bad choices. and it's the side of everyday finnish life about 80% of the population have no awareness of, unless movies like this are made.
