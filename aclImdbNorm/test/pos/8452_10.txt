i thoroughly enjoyed this film when it was first released, and on each occasion i've seen it since. the political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. the decades since the release of the film have demonstrated that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter.<br /><br />however, i think the most impressive element of this film is jack lemmon's performance. it is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work. he has the gift to be able to communicate so much, at times without saying a word. next time you watch this film, check out jack's face at the times he is not saying anything. he does not need to speak (or worse yet, to mug) to let you know what's going through his mind.<br /><br />i am calling this a spoiler, because of the impression it made on me when i first saw the film: in lemmon's last scene in the film, as he is lying on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. the terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images i have seen in any film. it is perfect acting, because it conveys instantly the threat about to occur--if jack's character is so terrified, there is certainly something awful about to happen. and it does.
