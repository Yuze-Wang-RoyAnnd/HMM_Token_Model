i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day. i love this type of comedy. it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here. i was rollin. i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title "seeing other people". the title caused me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did. i laughed so hard that it hurt. now it's part of my collection. i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart-ass type of comedy. i will be watching this one over and over.
