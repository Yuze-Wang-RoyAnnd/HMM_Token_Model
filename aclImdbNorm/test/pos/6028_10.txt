i must tell you the truth. the only reason i wanted to see this movie was because of rose mcgowan. i think that part definitely worked out...pretty well actually. however, the film was very good too. some parts of this movie are really good.<br /><br />the film has great action also. the mystery is pretty hard to figure out and rose [mcgowan] does some "oscar-worthy" acting towards the end of the film, but i don't want to give anything away. adam beach and jurgen prochnow are also great in the movie, along with some of the other stars.<br /><br />if you like mysteries, or action movies, or just like rose...i totally think you would like this movie.
