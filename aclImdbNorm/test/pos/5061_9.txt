rendition is a film not to miss with solid writing from kelley sane and with the direction of gavin hood that takes us on a story which is a ride through a man's journey through hell. once again, meryl streep in a convincing role of the cia today and great performances from a cast of superlative actors in reese witherspoon, jake gyllenhall and alan arkin, along with actors of middle eastern descent who add to the reality of the story.<br /><br />in rendition you see how "terrorism can breed terrorism" and as the film progresses tying the story to what is playing out in the middle east is reality brought to the screen. the external shots add to the intensity of the story and peter sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the "ass kissing" way of how american politics are conducted. too bad there has not been a larger audience for this film, as along with the valley of elah and lions for lambs, rendition plays an important role in showing an audience how the fight for and the protection of democracy can go seriously astray.
