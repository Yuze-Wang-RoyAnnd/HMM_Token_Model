on many levels it's very good. in fact, considering that this was a low-budget british indie by a first time feature-director with a largely neophyte cast, it's a magnificent achievement. i don't know how much it cost. the figure of lb8,000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is. the point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that great special effects, terrific production design, effective props and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix. even having said that, much of the script was great. the characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. this is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless blanks but these were ten characters - mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things. throughout the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. if the whole film was like the second act, it would be stunning.<br /><br />before the ship blows up, twelve people make it to individual escape pods or 'e-pods' which blast away from the ship. they're not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped, cramped and have no real idea where they're going - but that makes sense. i like the e-pods - they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice, roomy escape capsule. i also like the way that we are specifically told, later, that they are designed for ship-to-ship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet. that said, it doesn't look to me like there are 116 unused e-pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e-pod - but in he gets. (and it has just occurred to me: shouldn't the captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there?) anyway, the e-pods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same all over. we have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up, firing flares into the sky to locate each other.<br /><br />the captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try and contact 'captain behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. but they cannot do this from the planet, they need to get into orbit. the engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti-grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. it can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. the captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team. that's kid. i really liked the way that he now points out that his name is david and the captain starts using it, treating him with dignity and respect. that was good storytelling and good characterisation.
