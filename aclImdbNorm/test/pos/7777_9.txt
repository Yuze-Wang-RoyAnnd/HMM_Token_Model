it's a shame this movie didn't get more play in theatres. it's a rich, textured love story with believable, all-too-human characters, who are too busy gaming and protecting their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it. one of the most pleasurable aspects of this movie is its setting in chicago, among hip, artistic, literate, middle-class african-americans who discuss poetry, music and literature. another is his royal fineness, larenz tate -- and if you are even half a fan of his, you need to see this film! his boyish cockiness and vulnerability are perfect for the role of darius. nia long also shines as nina, who longs to tell darius she loves him but is afraid the break "the rules." a great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your sweetie!
