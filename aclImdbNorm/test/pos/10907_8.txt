this is truly a funny movie. his dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes i can recall. i thought the "i am gay" scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic, though it was funny. while watching it for the third time, i started to pick up on a little small segments that i had missed. one was when matt dillon's girl friend, a classic ditz, tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before. kevin klein made this film successful along tom selleck. this was also the first time i could appreciate debbie reynolds; she proved that she can be funny. she confirmed this in the tv series 'will and grace.' one discovery that i found after the third viewing is lauren ambrose of '6 feet under' fame. she sticks out with her red bangs, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. bob newhart is also very funny at the high school principle.
