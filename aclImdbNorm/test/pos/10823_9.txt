one comment said it wasn't a comedy...mistake! it was a delightful comedy of a period of history that doesn't lend itself easily to that genre. very busy...and active film from beginning to end. often the shots out the window of the train, or car, were just beautiful. an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater. all the french historical figures, like charles de gaulle and petain and the some of the people involved in the french resistance were included in the script, which might send those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of france under the german invasion might want to research. the characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent. recommend it, 9 out of 10.
