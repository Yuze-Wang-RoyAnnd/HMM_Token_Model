sharky's machine is a crime drama set in early 80's atlanta. it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city. the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to it's knees. sharky's link to bringing down this syndicate is a high-priced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie. the action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack / score are pretty good. the acting is b-level but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collection.<br /><br />overall 7/10<br /><br />peace <br /><br />buggieblade
