"a fare to remember" is a totally derivative, almost ridiculous movie, but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie. it stars a pretty newcomer, challen kates, as a high-powered ad executive who, right before her wedding, has to rush from l.a. to seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation. she has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money. this is the first dumb thing - were there no atms anywhere? she must make a fortune. at any rate, she meets a cab driver (warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky (the client's product), he's there to take her to the airport. all flights are canceled, so in order to get to l.a. for her wedding, she hires him to take her there.<br /><br />along the way, they bond and learn from each other. it's a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it - it combines "six days and seven nights" and a few other films. but the chemistry between the stars is good, they're likable, and the acting is good. look for jerry springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a cameo by karl malden.<br /><br />this is a nice film to take in over the holiday season. it's on lifetime.
