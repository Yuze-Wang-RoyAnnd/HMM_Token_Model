a very funny movie. michael douglas' "do" is worth watching this flick for if for no other reason. i'd like to see him do more of these low life roles. he was terrific, as were all the performers.<br /><br />the film struck me right off as an american roshomon, only funnier and easier to watch because it was in american and didn't need no stinkin subtitles!<br /><br />in a funny movie with a laugh every minute or so, two of the best were with john goodman (not someone i am crazy about) - 1. he is telling the priest about jewel doing something he liked and says "i had to wipe the smile off my face." the visual shows he is not smiling and clearly is a guy who never smiles, but probably doesn't know it. 2. the scene at the end between goodman, all suited up for jewel in his cop uniform, and grappling with the be-leathered reiser hunched over a table... and the two of them then protesting that they are not gay to another character who happens on the scene - this alone deserved a special comedy academy award.
