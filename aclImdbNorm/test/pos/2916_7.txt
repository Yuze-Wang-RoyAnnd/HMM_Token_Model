i'll start off right at the beginning by saying "i like this movie." it's sweeping, it's grand, it's gripping and it's fun. sinhue the physician,sits in front of his small stone hut writing his memoirs. and what a story it is! taken from a river and reared by an elderly couple who doted on him, he becomes a physician to the poor. he befriends horemheb who sees glory while sinhue sees healing. and both run into the future pharaoh anknaten (forgive my spellings), who endures an epileptic fit.<br /><br />and this pharaoh has another "flaw": he believes in one god instead of a pantheon of gods. back then, this was totally revolutionary. sinhue and horemheb grow up. one night, sinhue sees a woman who makes him lose his senses. he gives up his practice, sells his parents' home and even their tombs just to spend a night with her. does he? i won't tell. meanwhile, merit, a tavern maid played with sweet simplicity belying strength by jean simmons, falls in love with sinhue. she falls under his spell and under the spell of the belief in one god.<br /><br />victor mature overacts perfectly as horemheb. edmond purdom is sincere as sinhue the lost physician (does he find redemption? stay tuned). even bela darvi, the woman who steals sinhue's heart isn't as bad as everyone has said. the fact that she was daryl f. zanuck's mistress had nothing to do with the casting - right? yeah, right...still, she wasn't that bad _ i've seen worse. i think she did better in "the egyptian" than many of today's young actresses have done in anything. i said it before and i'll say it again -- i like this movie. i recommend it. it makes you think despite some hammy acting. have fun with this movie; it's worth it.
