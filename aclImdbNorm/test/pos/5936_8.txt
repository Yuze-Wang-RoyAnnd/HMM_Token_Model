the 2005 edition of the royal rumble came live from the save mart centre in fresno, california. the two top championships of the wwe were being defended, the undertaker was battling heidenreich in a casket match, shawn michaels was taking on edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last october and of course the every man for himself over the top rope royal rumble match itself. who was going to take the price this year? chris benoit? edge? eddie guerrero? edge? john cena? batista? edge? shawn michaels? there was no shortage of contenders.<br /><br />it was batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy, or should i say, a botched finish. batista and john cena were the final two men in the ring. batista was supposed to dump the young smackdown! star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went toppling to the floor. the referees acted on their feet as we had an arm-raising contest similar to that of bret hart and lex luger back in 1994. this brought out the chairman of the board. vinnie mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring. it was unusual to see vince mcmahon sitting, legs out, telling the two men to restart the match. batista then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped cena to the floor sealing his own future with a championship match at wrestlemania 21.<br /><br />the undercard for this years royal rumble had a very solid line up, with many of wwe's biggest stars competing in matches. each brand had two big matches each.<br /><br />raw opened the night with the match between shawn michaels and edge. this was a good technical contest. back and fourth all the way until edge got the pinfall. this was a smart booking decision and kept edge as a contender to the world heavyweight championship.<br /><br />the second match of the night was the feud ending casket match between the undertaker and heidenreich. the match was not a classic, but then again have their been any classic casket matches? it was entertaining. especially when snitsky got involved and then kane popped out the casket to a great pop. the undertaker surprised no one when he got the win, slamming the lid on heidenreich and this mediocre feud.<br /><br />the first of the two championship matches of the night was john bradshaw layfields defence of the wwe championship in a triple threat match against both kurt angle and the big show. this match was very good. again, not a classic but entertaining none the less. jbl took the win after pinning kurt angle. his celebration was short lived however when backstage teddy long informed him at no way out he would defend the wwe championship in a barbed wire steel cage match against big show. not a very nice way to spend a sunday night.<br /><br />and of course there is no show without punch. punch of course being reigning world heavyweight champion triple h. his rematch from unforgiven 2004 with randy orton was lot better than the original encounter. it's a pity because they just don't seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did. orton played the concussion role very well and went down in defeat to the game.<br /><br />so the first big one of 2005 was a good one. it achieved its goals. feuds ended and new ones began. we were now officially on the road to wrestlemania 21.
