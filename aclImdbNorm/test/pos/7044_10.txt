meatballs works its way into conversations, like no other movie. especially during summer. whether it's the song about the cits (counselors in training) or the cut-downs or the inspirational rudy the rabbit or it just doesn't matter speech...it pops up! poor mickey/morty, who knows where he'd wake up next!?! such a great snapshot of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-pc is really funny, no matter who you are! wheels and spaz are favorites, as is the hot dog eating contest with the famous line "what..? no mustard?" oh, how many times i've reiterated that line and been the only one laughing! thank you to the writers, actors and directors! applause, applause!
