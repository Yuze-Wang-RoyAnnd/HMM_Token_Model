i rarely even bother to watch comedic movies or television these days. they're insipid, vulgar, and, most importantly, not funny. this one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. it's worth watching, and i don't believe it would be dated in any significant way. classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created.<br /><br />i would love to see this film again; it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar "summer school" on television recently. like that slightly newer film, "meatballs" is funny without being cruel, overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor. the key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character -- maybe even a virtually life-saving change -- and how they both grow up in the space of a summer.
