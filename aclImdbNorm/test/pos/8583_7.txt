the english are a little too evil, the scots are a bit too<br /><br />heroic. the dialogue is overly dramatic at times, and the<br /><br />transitions between scenes could be smoother.<br /><br />still, "the bruce" has the feel of authentic, if unpolished,<br /><br />history ... even if it does play loosely with some important<br /><br />facts.<br /><br />sandy welch is no gibson or branagh, but he makes a stalwart<br /><br />bruce. and brian blessed chews the scenery in delightful<br /><br />villainy as edward i.<br /><br />while lacking the budget needed to make the final battle truly<br /><br />impressive, they still marshalled an impressive crowd for the<br /><br />english and scottish armies. it is, according to filmmakers, the<br /><br />"largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in<br /><br />the british isles."<br /><br />allowing for a few failings and shortcomings, the film still<br /><br />does a convincing portrayal.
