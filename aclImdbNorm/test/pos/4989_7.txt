too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by mcmurtry about the texas rangers vs. the indian. this screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline. it ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to lonesome dove.<br /><br />the series main characters were in truth cast very well, the filming locations were excellent, but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book.
