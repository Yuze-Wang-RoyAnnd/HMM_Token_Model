i don't ever remember reading sarah, plain and tall in school, but when my son told me about it and said they watched the movie in class, i wanted to see it too. i borrowed the video from the library and watched it as a family. it was a wonderful story. however, i didn't know until a few months ago that there were sequels. i finished watching those this week. i discovered one small oops: in the second movie, skylark, jacob is reminiscing when he was a boy, and tells sarah "my brothers and sisters and i would dream...". in winter's end, those "brothers and sisters" don't exist in conversations between jacob and his father. but it is a very small oops, and i only caught it watching the trilogy, the second time around. great movie, a must see for good wholesome family viewing.
