this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch, i mean it wasn't great but it was one of the better horror movies of late. it seems to have been low, almost state benefit budget size but it has it's charms like the lovely ladies in it. the atmosphere was good also (which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days). the acting was your typical 80's low budget affair, that being in case you don't know is that it is "dud" acting. but that is what lucio fulci's movies were full of, they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc. they more than made up for in the horror & gore & atmosphere for the movie it's self.<br /><br />it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable, i watched it all the way and i love horror movies. i've seen movies where i just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward it if it's on video, or skip scene's on the dvd. this movie didn't make me want to do that, i sat and watched it all the way to the end, without wanting to skip parts.<br /><br />i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy kreuger as your babysitter, not. but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection, maybe.<br /><br />the music in this movie was top notch stuff, ideal horror music so it was. i've seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better, thank goodness though this movie didn't have nay of the metal music in it.<br /><br />i've been a die-hard metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music spoils it, the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing. so i'm glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy, well done.<br /><br />it could have use "profane grace - epitaph of shattered dreams" on it though. as it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except "really" creepy keyboard tracks. like track one "forever sleep" you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it. ever track on that cd is the same, ideal horror music at it's best, it would have suited this movie perfectly.<br /><br />the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed/killed (or so we are led to believe) and hung up as a scarecrow, only to get free and try to escape later. every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed, a big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one i mentioned above.<br /><br />i wish that hollywood (mainstream side of things) would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie. as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called paul anderson of the "resident evil" mince.<br /><br />well done guys, it is not bad, not bad at all, i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie (behind the scene's) not many movies do this kind of thing, which i thought added a little to the movie, as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me.<br /><br />rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9/10, rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9/10, rating for the score for the film 9.5/10.
