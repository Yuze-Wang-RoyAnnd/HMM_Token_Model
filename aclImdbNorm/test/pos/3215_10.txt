wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, lauren graham and alexis bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of lauren graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a "monster" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like lauren better! anyway it's a real delight seeing them on screen, "sparing" with words! in the words of the immortal jim carrey "b-e-a-utiful!"
