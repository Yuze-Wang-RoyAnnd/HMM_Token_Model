there are a select few cartoon films where animals or something "not human" is portraying human beings and i think that this film is one of them. apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. although - it's good someone did not - i feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)<br /><br />this film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a disney film. it mentions alcohol*, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack "tresspassing" humans and it shows a male cat called (abraham delacy gieuseppe casi thomas) o' malley, fancying a female cat, in a surprisingly human and adult way.<br /><br />as a cartoon film - or just a film in general, i feel this is pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good. the film (in general) is set in france and you meet a family of cats - the mother duchess and her kittens marie, toulouse and berlioz. you also meet the kind (rich) old woman who adores the cats, the butler edgar and an old man (who has clearly lost his marbles) called george. the kind old woman discusses her will with george and edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it. he is incredibly cross with this - and has an evil scheme in mind...<br /><br />a very cute film for every age - enjoy "aristocats"!<br /><br />*not including "basil the great mouse detective" and a few others maybe which i cannot think of at the moment.
