this movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. in a lonely danish town, two old sisters live remembering a far youths, when, due to a strict puritan education, they had to reject happiness. lonely, then, the live in a dignified austerity, until babette, who flies from paris, frightened by the horror of the war, arrives. in few time, she will be able to turn the goodness and love she received when she arrived. a good lottery prize lets her organize a great banquet, following the best rules of french gastronomy. all neighbourhoods are invited (all fanatically puritans). they accept, but they pact to not show any trace of pleasure or enjoyment, as it would be a sin. however, the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat, that they become seduced by the sensuality of french gastronomy. the banquet end in a very felt, though quietly, happiness. the love between humans has awaken. the miracle of rise the human kindness due to the pleasure of the sense has begun. the movie is surprisingly good, but it is not for all tastes. during most of the movie, nothing happens, all is so quiet and so peaceful, that during many minutes, you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the town. but, as the movie develops, it becomes more precious, when babette wins the lottery prize (after 30min movie), the show begins. the author is able, with a perfect directing, to show us how babette prepares the banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful one (love), all told in a quiet delicious way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. then, as the banquet goes by, the quality in showing us how the mood of all eaters changes due to the meal, only with first shots, with impressively filmed scenes one after another is simply astonishing. in addition, the tact with the colours and the photography is also superb, almost every scene of the movie is like a picture, so work is involved there. if you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important, this is your movie. if you happen to like good meals and just love the good gastronomy, probably, you'll feel amused, as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you. an oscar totally deserved. the only problem is its slowness at setting up the story, but, i can forgive it (i hope everyone too)
