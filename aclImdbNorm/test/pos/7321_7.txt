directed by the younger brother of great director leo mccarey this is a pretty good short from the three stooges, nominated for an academy award. here the stooges are doctors named doctor howard, doctor fine and doctor howard. they are not the brightest doctors but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they handle for duty and humanity.<br /><br />i liked this short. it is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though. one joke that is repeated more than once works every time. the part where they must operate the hospital's boss is terrific. to say more would spoil some of the jokes, so you must see it for yourself. just another fine short from the three stooges.
