i went to see this movie at a book signing in lexington, ky last night. after a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with mr. bruce campbell (you have to say it all, not just bruce or mr. campbell ;d), friends while the books were being signed, and a qna session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed.<br /><br />so as not to spoil anything, i wont go into detail...but i loved the movie! mr. bruce campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel. the characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (what movies do *you* know of that are based in bulgaria?) and the setting was both near-original and fun! on top of that the humor that is portioned throughout the movie that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie.<br /><br />while this movie dosen't have as great of a general appeal to people as some, it is a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of (as mr. bruce campbell put it) 'b-movies' that are listed as 'a-movies' (bewitched, dukes of hazard, charlie and the chocolate factory? come on guys!).
