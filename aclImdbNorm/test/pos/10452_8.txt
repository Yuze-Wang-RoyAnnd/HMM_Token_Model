this is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made.<br /><br />i saw this growing up and it was, and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "fast times" but just as great.<br /><br />there is a serious side to this movie, as mentioned by other reviewers it starts as a comedy and morphs into a drama about halfway through. that's the beauty of it though and what sets it apart. you get it all. humor(not unlike that of "fast times" ), drama, and a great great soundtrack.<br /><br />i personally think every kid about to enter high school should see this, it would give an idea about the journey their about to embark on. cmon-what kid watching this, wouldn't be able to relate to someone in the movie? the fact that it becomes so serious halfway though is also cool and just superbly well done.you don't even see it coming. definitely a lot of surprises.<br /><br />spoilers:don't read anymore if you don't want to know.<br /><br />great, knee slappping humor.(who could forget the scene between gary and camilla?). i can still hear it:"oh my big strong burrito!!" priceless!!<br /><br />some of the scenes between gary and karin are hard to watch(particularly the final scene of coarse). there are so so many women like karen out there who would have made the exact same choice she did. think about it-how many women reject men with hearts of gold(like gary) for jerks? i know i've done it-and so have many females i know. this movie will inspire discussion and, despite the countless times i've seen it, still leaves me filled with admiration for the film makers and performers. everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what's more likely more then one person.<br /><br />lastly, the music used is just great(a lot of cars, u2,lots of obscure(now) songs from the 80's.-an 80's purist's dream.)<br /><br />but make no mistake, it is not the music that makes this movie unique, it is the story itself, plain and simple. one of the best of it's kind and a teen movie classic.
