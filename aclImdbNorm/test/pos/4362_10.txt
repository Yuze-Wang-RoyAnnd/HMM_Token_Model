little dieter needs to fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the g"oteborg filmfestival. as i was extremely tired that evening, i was hesitant to see it, but the raving overall score of 9 here at imdb made me go there.<br /><br />it was 80 minutes of pure life-force! experiencing dieter denglers life through his own telling was enchanting.<br /><br />see it! and if possible... see it at a cinema!
