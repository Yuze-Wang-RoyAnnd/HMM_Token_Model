i first saw this movie at a video store and, being the bam margera fan i am, had to rent it to see what it was all about. since i have a huge and stupid (note the word stupid) sense of humor, i found this movie absolutely hilarious. some of the parts are pointless and random, but that's what makes them so amusing. you'll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie. i was really impressed.<br /><br />i was also surprised at the acting. these people actually did a good job. nothing oscar worthy, but well enough to get past the amateur level. teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situations used. i wouldn't suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa.<br /><br />all in all, the acting was great, the script was hilarious, and the story is really something you can relate to.
