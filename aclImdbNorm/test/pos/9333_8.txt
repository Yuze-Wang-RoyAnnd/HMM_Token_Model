although i am not a michael jackson fan, i like some of his early songs and some from jackson 5 too. 'thriller' is one of his great songs and it comes from the best-selling album ever with the same title. as for the video, it is awesome, one of michael's best, but also very eccentric and weird.<br /><br />there is a story behind this video, but it's so complex that even i can't fully understand it. it's freaky. the freakiest things are jackson's transformation into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and those dead people dancing.<br /><br />the video is very dark, thrilling, chilly and original. there are great sceneries and settings. the music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic from the good old pop from the 80's.<br /><br />i like vincent price's soliloquy. he does a great narration with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laughter at the end is awesome! my favorite videos of the 'king of pop' are "billie jean" and "don't stop 'til you get enough" (both among his best songs).
