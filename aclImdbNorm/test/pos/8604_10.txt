this is a pretty faithful adaptation of masuji ibuse's novel, "black rain." like the book it is very moving and thought-provoking. the story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece successfully married. they are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness, after walking through hiroshima on the day of the bombing. well filmed, well acted, moving, tragic, horrifying and funny.
