i saw the film in its original theatrical release in austin texas. the old paramount theatre (i don't know if it still exists.) went all out with speakers around the walls connected accurately to all six channels. at 15 years of age, i was blown away. the concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and film at that time.<br /><br />i vividly remember at least three outstanding scenes where the surround sound made a huge impact. (though please forgive me if time has warped my memories with inaccuracies.) the first was a travel by the camera through catfish row, alive with the sites and sounds of daily activity. you saw each one first, such as a blacksmith for example, then as the camera passed them by their sound would continue to be heard passing left or right down the side of the theater to the rear. the second was a marching band that was seen first in the front, then it marched past the camera splitting left and right. not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own directional path, it also changed in timbre as it played toward you, to the side of you, and then away from you. and if that wasn't enough, they also accounted for the doppler effect for each instrument as it went by. the third scene was near the end of the movie as porgy is leaving catfish row for new york to look for bess. he and about half the cast members pass by the camera as they leave the village with the same sound effects as the marching band. the other half of the cast/chorus sing along with them and also wave and voice goodbyes to porgy and their other friends. the friends' replies can then be heard from the sides and the rear.<br /><br />surround sound was used with splendid effects throughout the movie. i think i remember a rock or something thrown from a pier and hearing it land in the water behind me. little things like that were evident to theater-goers lucky enough to have the full six channels -- things that would just seem mundane in theaters without it.<br /><br />i stayed in the theater for several showings. you could do that then. and i went back several more times before it left town. i never saw the movie again. it literally begs for release on dvd with restored picture fidelity and surround sound. i do hope someone somewhere has preserved it. please, gershwin family, allow it to be released before it is lost for good to other generations.
