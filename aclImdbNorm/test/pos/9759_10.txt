jean paget, joe harman, and noel strachan--all are unlikely heroes and survivors. petite but strong jean whose strength and resolve help save lives, marching hundreds of miles and with calm self-discipline and persuasive powers, joe harman ("oh my word") who took risks for jean and the other prisoners, only to suffer the worst pain imaginable, and noel strahan, who trusted jean regardless of the odds. her good humor and hardiness inspire everyone around her, and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded. the beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure. despite the length it was never boring to me. these ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story. someone borrowed my vhs a few years ago and i never saw it or them again. learned my lesson, mates, and will buy another copy when it can be found. it's a shame the miniseries is not on dvd.
