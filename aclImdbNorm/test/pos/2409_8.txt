i'm not sure how i can make ten lines out of this question, but i'll try.<br /><br />when julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music. what was the name of the song that was playing and who played it? <br /><br />i love that song! and i watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song.<br /><br />i did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack but i sill can't find the song.<br /><br />it might be because the song they were dancing to wasn't a complete song and just partial.<br /><br />i would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it.<br /><br />thank you.<br /><br />frank
