this wonderful film has never failed to move me. the colour, convincing cast, and stunning scenery all make big contributions. this production, unlike the later remake by carlton, is more impressionistic, and presented more from the children's own perspective. it focusses on certain episodes from e. nesbit's charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary "warts-and-all" style that carlton adopts. above all, the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas underpins the story throughout, adding extra emotional depth. the net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of "the railway children".<br /><br />one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! yes, maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horse-drawn carts, but what about the quality of life in general? consider the foul-mouthed celebrities who now "grace" our tv screens. their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. consider, too, the fragile "here today, gone tomorrow" aspects of so many of today's "partnerships" plus all the single mothers - whatever happened to that institution called "marriage", when people accepted each others' flaws but still remained together, loving their children? these details add extra piquancy when watching this marvellous film.<br /><br />i hope that, as generations pass, children will still be able to enjoy this film. not to mention certain adults!
