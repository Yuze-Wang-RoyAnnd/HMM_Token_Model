aside from the discotheque scenes that epitomize the swinging sixties (especially with everyone dancing to instrumental versions of monkees hits), i am surprised how well this lightweight farce holds up 37 years later, but indeed it does thanks to the breezy execution of its deception-based plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads. directed by the redoubtable stage-to-screen expert gene saks, this 1969 comedy is about julian winston, a successful manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor, who pretends to be married in order to avoid long-term commitment with his young girlfriend of a year, toni. in response to toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, julian agrees to marry her, but toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience. enter julian's devoted nurse stephanie to play the wife, and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and de-couplings.<br /><br />as julian, a relaxed walter matthau dexterously plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner, but he lets his two female co-stars walk off with the picture. in her big screen debut, a pixyish 24-year old goldie hawn is still retaining her giggly "laugh-in" persona but provides unexpected savvy and depth as toni. she and matthau have great, unforced chemistry in their scenes together. screen legend ingrid bergman, still serenely regal at 54, is obviously having a ball playing stephanie, initially starchy and quick-witted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the story evolves. i particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp. there is nice supporting work from rick lenz as toni's bohemian neighbor igor and jack weston as julian's smarmy actor buddy harvey. billy wilder's longtime collaborator, i.a.l. diamond, provides the sparkling screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stage-bound origins for saks, who is not the most cinematic of directors. other than a couple of trailers, there are no significant extras with the dvd.
