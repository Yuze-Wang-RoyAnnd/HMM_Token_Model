the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. starting with both "breathless" and underground american cinema (such as kenneth anger), films became more and more experimental. all of this accumulated when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with "easy rider". one of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "head" was made when the monkees career was seriously waning, which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made.<br /><br />the plot? well, there really isn't one, as many have said. it involves the monkees going from one surreal scenario to the next one. however, these sequences are all obviously lsd-tinged and basically mock how the monkees were sick of being confined to their light pre-fab reputation. its a shame that the film found no audience. the teeny boppers who loved them had moved onto a new fad as they always do. the psychedelic / haight-ashbury crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a monkees movie. its all their loss. this film may be plot less, but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together. the crew later made both "easy rider" and "five easy pieces". the film was later revived at a 1973 raybert retrospective and it gained a very positive response, which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time. ironically, the monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their later 80s reunion.
