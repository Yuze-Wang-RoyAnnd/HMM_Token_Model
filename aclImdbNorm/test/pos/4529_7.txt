this is the thirteenth falcon film. tom conway has lost none of his humour and style, and is not showing signs of getting tired. the film has a very satisfying story, with lots of red herrings, suspects, and dames. madge meredith is the good girl of the story, she plays it adequately but by no means sets the screen on fire. myrna dell is a bad girl, and she puts on an excellent face of stone, with eyes of agate, and you are just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible to cheer herself up. edward brophy is back as goldie the sidekick, but surprise surprise, his manic over-acting has stopped, and he is actually under control. this is a fine tribute to the directorial skills of william a. berke, who had done so many westerns he probably was not prepared to take any nonsense from a brooklyn dummy. the result is that for the first time, possibly in his career, brophy was toned down enough actually to add something to a film rather than try the viewer's patience with the irritating behaviour of a retarded but unruly six year-old. it all goes along very well, and is thoroughly entertaining.
