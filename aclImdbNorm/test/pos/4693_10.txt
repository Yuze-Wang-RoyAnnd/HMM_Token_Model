this htv series is beautiful. i strongly recommend watching the movie. it has got everything it should: remarkable script, strong characters, beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere. add some ambient score from clannad and you receive unforgettable picture. i love every adventure movie from htv i saw: return to treasure island, smuggler, adventurer, but robin of sherwood beats them all. i would like to thank the whole htv production team and richard carpenter in particular for giving me plenty of adventures and excitement. i have got the dvd release in my little movie collection. i regret very much movies like these are not made anymore.
