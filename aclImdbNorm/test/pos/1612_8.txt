thomas mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film "a death in venice. " although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director luchino visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a composer. as such, the author/composer, gustav von aschebach (dirk bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. after a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. he decides to go on vacation to venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. however, while staying at the picturesque seaside resort, he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy, tadzio (bj"orn andr'esen) who eyes him with curious interest and is immediately smitten by him. although gustav is captivated by the wondrous youth, he nevertheless must find some private time away from the boy's governess (nora ricci), while having to cope with a invading plague which seems to have infested the city. the movie dialog, like the novel remains subtle as are the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist. in the end. the audience unlike the book is hampered with innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy. their affair is never given wing, substance or opportunity and were it not for the brief resolution in the book, the film allows only the possibility of 'what if.' nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment's peace to obtain that which is forbidden, elusive but definitely criticized by prying eyes. great story and a bogarde classic. ****
