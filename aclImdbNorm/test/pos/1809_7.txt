this typical teenagers movie is one of the best, beside the story is good, the music is well accompany the movie all along. <br /><br />although i do not enjoy classic movie unless it is classic and better written script, this one is exceptional. maybe the hair style and language should be change a bit, in the 80's i believe offensive language is still rarely heard.<br /><br />
