pot-seeking pre-teen joshua miller (as tim) throws his sister's doll into the river while daniel roebuck (as samson) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing danyi deats (as jamie). the doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the "river's edge", for any passerby to see. viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. stoners keanu reeves (as matt) and crispin glover (as layne) are found most camera-worthy. the friends wonder what to do about their guilty, beer-guzzling killer friend.<br /><br />veteran-in-the-cast dennis hopper (as feck) keeps the youngsters' heads fed. mr. hopper once killed a woman. he lives with one of those life-sized sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. ione skye leitch (as clarissa) is a more living doll, and she is waiting for reeves to kiss her. their copulation is notably cross-cut with a flashback to the opening strangulation. an actual teenager, in her first feature role, ms. leitch is the daughter of sixties-singer donovan. make other quirky connections on your own.<br /><br />you can read a lot into the movie, or not, depending on your mood. some of the characters' backgrounds may be a little too subtle. most obviously, the killer teen was teased; note his weight, attitude, and "toilet"-connected nickname. some of the characters' relationships and motivations are too vaguely defined, but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting; and, director tim hunter, photographer frederick elmes, and writer neal jimenez are obviously skilled.<br /><br />******* river's edge (8/27/86) tim hunter ~ keanu reeves, crispin glover, dennis hopper, joshua miller
