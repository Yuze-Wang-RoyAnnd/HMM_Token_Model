i don't know what it is about the crew from cky, but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity. haggard is so incredibly dumb and funny that it's almost comedic excellence. sometimes it makes absolutely no sense, but who cares?<br /><br />it made me laugh my ass off. a must-have for the cky/jackass aficionado!
