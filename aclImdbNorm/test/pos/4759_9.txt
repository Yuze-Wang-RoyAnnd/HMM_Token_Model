i was born in '68 with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv (as a kid in the 70's). i always loved this movie (and the french connection) and would always try to catch it whenever it was on (checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time). i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say, i still love it!!!! roy s. was a great actor from the 70's (jaws is one of my all-time favs, marathon man etc) and although the 7-ups is not an oscar-worthy film, it puts you precisely in a time a place (ny, early 70's, as did french connection) and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time. and yes, the car chase is one of the all-time best.
