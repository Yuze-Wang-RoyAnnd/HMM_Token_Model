very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's objectives in flushing out the terrorists.<br /><br />the story is interwoven where two families are adversely affected by the terrorist events.<br /><br />this is one of meryl streep's best roles in years. she plays a cold, calculating, cunning director of the cia who allows these things to go on. she is out of the george bush-dick cheney school of handling the war on terrorism. had her part been expanded, miss streep certainly would have been up for an award at oscar time.<br /><br />jake gyllenhaal is our hero. a cia agent who really can't take what's going on.<br /><br />we have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed, finely paced film.<br /><br />alan arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator. mr. arkin seems to get better with age.
