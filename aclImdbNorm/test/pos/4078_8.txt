i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films . for me tvms usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn`t need tissues it needs insulin . so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv schedules i sat down waiting to be bored senseless . i was surprised.<br /><br />no strike that last sentence , i wasn`t surprised i was shocked . here is a tvm that grips you tighter than a great white shark , in fact deadly voyage doesn`t deserve to be relegated to the tv schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what`s more it`s - unlike papillon and sleepers - completely true <br /><br />for those who don`t know the story !!!!! possible spoilers as to plot !!!!! sometime in the early 90s a bunch of africans stowed away on an ukrainian freight ship bound for france in order to work there. of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the africans after discovering them hiding in the hold. all except one african , kingsley ofusu , who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship , but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away .<br /><br />just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is . what a remarkable story , and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true . it`s very well written , directed and acted , especially by sean pertwee ( why isn`t that guy a big name star ? ) , and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . i look forward to seeing again .<br /><br />but you`ve got to ask yourself how can a tvm be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time ? oh hold on , i`ve just had a disturbing thought about jerry bruickhiemer doing a remake with tony scott directing and with denzil washington playing kingsley , brad pitt playing pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc. let`s keep deadly voyage a superlative tvm rather than a poor blockbuster
