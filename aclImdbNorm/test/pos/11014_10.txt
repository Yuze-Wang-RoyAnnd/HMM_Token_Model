one of the best movies i ever saw - a classic "matrix" movie. for many years, i have been trying to get it on vhs or dvd - to no avail. the german movie/tv industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions (and this is fassbinder, after all!) rot away and collect dust in some archive rather than distribute it commercially (and make a lot of money with it if that is what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking). though, the wdr once told me if i paid dm 200.00 to check the copyright (non-reimbursable), and then dm 8 per minute of copying, plus the cost for the materials, then they will consider preparing a (single!) copy for me. some way to sell something! the same problem we have with many other tv movies or series like "so weit die f"usse tragen", "sonntagseltern", "kellerkinder", and others. excellent tv series - never to be heard of again. germany, wake up!<br /><br />update from march 2007: last year, i finally could get a dvd copy from the "mittschnittservice" of the wdr for about 50+ euro. great!
