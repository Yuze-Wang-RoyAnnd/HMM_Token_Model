campfire tales (1997)<br /><br />an excellent peace of work. everything about this film is just perfect.<br /><br />the film has a great cast as you can see from imdb. the reason i brought the film was because of christine taylor and the love for horror films. lets get to the main parts<br /><br />1. there are 4 teenagers in this film , after crashing their car they decide to tell some spooky stories 2. there are 3 stories and the main plot ( the 4 teenagers are the main plot) 3. the best story is " people can lick too"in my opinion. the least scary story is possibly "honeymoon" or the 2nd story (can't remember the name"<br /><br />4. "people can lick too" is about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl( over the internet). he starts chatting to a girl called amanda and then enters her house . very creepy stuff this story will make you think twice of chatting to someone online. basically a pervert enters her house and things go creepy.<br /><br />5. the main plot is sweet and simple, teenagers crash, tell stories, try to freak each other out. but there's a very cool twist at the end.<br /><br />the only bad part of this movie is, the teenagers crash their car into another couple, but the kids don't bother seeing if the couple are ok. they just talk about the couple who they've crashed into.<br /><br />the men and women who made this film made it to scare people, not to make money. unlike "scream" and "i know what you did last summer", this film is created to scare you. "scream" and "i know what you did last summer" were made to make big time cash.<br /><br />even though this movie wasn't pushed as publicly as scream was , it's still 10 times better than scream and "i know what you did last summer".<br /><br />the characters in this movie are great and have realistic characteristics. the cast who play theses characters are great. christine taylor does a fabulous job with lauren, doesn't go over the top with the acting. the dude who plays eric (laurens younger brother) also does a good job of showing men or teenage boys can also get freaked out. screams is like a spoof movie, the murderer is a joke and the kids are dumb <br /><br />unlike scream and "i know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people, not a goof of a movie, should of been more noticed.
