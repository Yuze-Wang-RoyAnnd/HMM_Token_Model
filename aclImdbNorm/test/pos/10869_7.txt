i learned a thing: you have to take this film like a funny period comedy, if you don't want to be disappointed. the film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy. i think the over-hype damaged it: the too much glorified monica bellucci appears in few scenes and isn't so good as they wanted to let you believe. she sounds unnatural, false: the best actress in this film is sabrina impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect tuscan accent and shines together with massimo ceccherini. elio germano is very, very good: the most promising young italian actor, according to me. daniel auteuil looks like napoleon, but i preferred other actors. so, the most hyped performances were also the worst.<br /><br />costumes and production design are okay: sure, american period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets, but the italian ability rewards the lack of money. a nice period comedy, in short, with a first-rate casting (except for bellucci and auteuil).
