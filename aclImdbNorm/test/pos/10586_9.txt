set in bam margera's hometown of westchester pa, 'haggard' is a semi-true story about the life of ryan dunn and his buddies falcone and vallo.<br /><br />dunn has been dumped by his girlfriend of 2 years, glauren, who is now seeing a beer swilling, long haired metal head named 'hellboy' and this is driving dunn insane with jealousy.<br /><br />in a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is going on between glauren and hellboy, dunn pays his friends vallo and falcone to break into her house and produce evidence of the affair, with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned! i found this movie very funny, maybe partly because i am a total jackass and cky fan, and it has to be said that a lot of the humour will probably be lost on those that do not have prior knowledge of margera insane brand of 'comedy'.<br /><br />the movie contains much that will be of interest to skaters, not least the cameo appearance of skateboarding legend, tony hawk as a police officer. there are also cameo's from bucky lasek, brandon novak, jason ellis, and bam's long suffering parents, april and phil.<br /><br />the dvd extra's include music video's from cky (featuring bam's brother jess on drums), and bam's favourite band, him (bam's character in the movie takes his name from him frontman ville vallo) there is also a documentary and a "too hot for jackass" skit.<br /><br />in summary, as i said before, this movie will mainly be of interest to skaters and jackass/cky fans, but i do feel that margera and co have made a great effort with 'haggard' and i for one, thoroughly enjoyed it.
