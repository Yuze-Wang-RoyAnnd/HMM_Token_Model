in fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them. he was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat.<br /><br />the merchant of four seasons is one of fassbinder's first movie to make great use of color, from the bright green pears in the merchant's cart to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a fassbinder movie? who'd have thought).<br /><br />his camera work was getting there too, but it was still fairly minimalist. the occasional zooms seem a bit uncomfortable at times and unnatural, but then again, fassbinder was still coming out of his purely avant garde phase. this might be because michael ballhaus isn't behind the camera, but instead the slightly inferior dietrich lohmann.<br /><br />still, this is fassbinder, and you get your fix here. broken dreams shown so vividly and unflinchingly as to alienate audience and drive them into a depressed stupor. just what the doctor ordered. an early classic that shows remarkable progression when compared to his first films released only 2 years prior.
