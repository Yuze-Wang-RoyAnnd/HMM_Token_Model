i really wanted to write a title for this review that didn't come off as corny or gushing but still described my feelings for this show. i can see now that it is not possible. "american family" is one of the best shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching on television. several reviewers here on imdb have mentioned the word "beautiful" when describing this show. never has a word been more fitting. the cinematography for this show is stunning. every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece. the lighting, camera moves, scene composition and colors...i have to keep reminding myself that i'm watching a tv show and not a motion picture masterpiece. the score by lee holdridge and nathan wang brings tears to my eyes. and most importantly, the acting by the all around amazing cast is honest and sincere. i do not feel like i am watching performances...i feel like i'm watching real life. if only real life could be this beautiful.<br /><br />"american family" has indeed raised the bar for quality entertainment on television. i highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it. i could easily chide cbs for passing on this show, but i have to say that it doesn't matter to me who airs it. i'm just glad it's out there for everyone to see. so i do thank pbs for not allowing this show to disappear into nothingness.<br /><br />i have to give special recognition to the way each season's finale ended. the first one was pure creative brilliance and it moved me to tears. i was waiting to see if season two would also end in a creative way, and sure enough it did. again, tears.<br /><br />my thanks to all of those involved. you really have made a special piece of art with this show, and i sincerely mean that. it is a shame that we only got two seasons, but a miracle we got anything at all.
