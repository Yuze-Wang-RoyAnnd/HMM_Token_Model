this is a love story set against the back drop of television news. the three main stars, william hurt,holly hunter and albert brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the washington bureau of a tv network.<br /><br />tom grunick(hurt)is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star.jane (hunter)is the producer who recognises that tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway.aaron altman(brooks)is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her.<br /><br />holly hunter was nominated for a best actress academy award ,but lost out to cher(moonstruck!).she was robbed! this is hunter's film.her character jane is smart,ruthless and totally driven. she is also hilariously neurotic. her performance is perfect.just watch her face when she watches the tape of tom's interview of a rape victim. the scales literally fall from her eyes.<br /><br />wiliam hurt's performance is less showy.he plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud,but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like jane.he gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating.<br /><br />the film comments on celebrity, journalism,integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. it predicted that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures.<br /><br />think about this:this film was released before the end of the cold war and before rise of reality tv.yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news.paris hilton's release from jail was treated like a major news story! to see how prophetic this film is,just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters.tom grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!
