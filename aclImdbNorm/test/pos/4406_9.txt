as someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of north london in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion, this film immediately appealed. throw in my interest in what london was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of tv heaven! on paper the film ticked all the right boxes, and having just watched "the knowledge" the actual movie itself certainly lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations.<br /><br />visually, i was surprised how different london looked back then (i lived in islington in the 90s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). it truly came across as grimy, tatty and down-at-heel. london may still have bad housing estates, but the general feel of the place is much cleaner, brighter and pleasant nowadays (based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories).<br /><br />as for the story and the acting, well top marks obviously go to nigel hawthorne as the vampire. absolutely brilliant! he acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between total straight-faced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the knowledge boys as he puts them through test after test.<br /><br />all in all this was an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that i find endlessly fascinating. but even if you're not especially interested in london circa 1979, you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of "the knowledge".
