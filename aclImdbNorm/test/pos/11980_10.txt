i caught "on the run" at the screening room in new york and was immediately seduced by its true independent spirit. starring michael imperioli and john ventimiglia from the sopranos cast, "on the run" sets us up in a 24-hour wild ride in the city that never sleeps, as we follow the meanderings of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly dragged by his long-gone school companion, just out of jail. in fact he has escaped from it and is "on the run" looking for some action and a glimpse of life amidst the great metropolis. powered by great performances, this movie gives us back the old feeling of 70's pics, with both characters rediscovering themselves as they blaze across town bumping into wild events and locals. an elegy to a certain side of new york that seems to be disappearing, "on the run" displays great sensitivity and humour. i predict it to be a cult classic that urges to be discovered: future viewers should definitely surrender to this nocturnal trip.
