i was so moved by this film in 1981, i went back to the theater four times to see it again! something i have never done for another film. no movie evokes the feelings of growing up in the 60's like four friends. that it so closely approximated my own experiences in the 60's is probably something that many will share. jodi thelen is radiantly beautiful and unforgetable! why she didn't become a major star after this i will never know. the acting by the entire cast is flawless as is steve tisch's script. i always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical. but alas, steve is no longer here to answer that question. i have all but worn out my vhs copy of this great movie! highly recommended!
