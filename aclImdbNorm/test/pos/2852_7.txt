this is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. the true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. the unbelievable story of a guy who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. gosh, is this what life made us be? people deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? "toto, i think we're not in kansas anymore".
