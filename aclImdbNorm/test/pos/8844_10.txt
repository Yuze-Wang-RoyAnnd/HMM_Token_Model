i cannot believe i never added my two cents about this film as yet!<br /><br />this is one of the best films of all time. many critics and movie-goers alike talk of john carpenter's "halloween" for setting trends and being "his best work". those folks have not seen this version of "the thing" because it is right up there with "halloween".<br /><br />john carpenter's work shines in this film. he took a film that was already made and instead of "re-making" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! brilliant.<br /><br />the casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today "who goes there?" in that film. this film had no hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. another brilliant move.<br /><br />i was at the screening for this film when i was on vacation in southern california. the audience at the screening went wild! i carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! we all thought that there was no way on god's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. but by box office receipts, it was a dud because of "et, the extra terrestrial" and "poltergeist" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.<br /><br />this film was what i, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. not kids playing adults. not little miss "big-breasted" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation but real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. heck, being a feminist, i didn't even miss women in this film! and good for mr. carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (unless, "the thing" was actually feminine! something to think about!)<br /><br />i saw special effects of that time i had never seen before, i saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. this is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. today, the directors wimp out. today, the studios wimp out. too much cgi and not enough belief, too much cgi and not enough story, not enough imagination. you leave the theater and in a week -- or less -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. this one stays with ya. that's one of the marks of an excellent film.<br /><br />on many reviews i've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. for films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. this film is not for everyone.<br /><br />i find it horrific that they lable this film a "cult" film. i find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. after john carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of "the thing".<br /><br />i am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. you'll talk about it for years as well.
