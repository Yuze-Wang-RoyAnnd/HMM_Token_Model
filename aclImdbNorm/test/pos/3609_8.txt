warning: if the coen brothers or david lynch define your taste in film, disregard this review and move on.<br /><br />yes, i borrowed the "one line summary" from the book about president ronald reagan, but, among other virtues, this movie emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of honorable human beings. this film is full of honest, decent people, and they have integrity to spare. in a word, they have "character."<br /><br />a small nitpick: unless you know the history of ww ii, you probably don't know that, from captain correlli's arrival on the island to the fall of mussolini, 3 and one-half years have passed. the average viewer might think the romance was of the "whirlwind" variety. that is not so. the romance develops slowly, which gives it both dignity and meaning. the film's deliberate pace may be the director's way of marking time.<br /><br />some reviews have criticized cage's italian accent. the italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good. <br /><br />the history was right on the mark. yes, the germans turned against their italian allies, who, for the most part, were reluctant allies from the start. if you find that shocking, keep in mind that the french mediterranean fleet was blown up by the british in 1940, just after france's capitulation, lest it fall in the hands of the vichy government, or worse, the nazis.<br /><br />the depiction of the italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to an educated and cultured civilization.<br /><br />this film was beautifully photographed, and its story was lyrical. the script was not thought-provoking, nor was it clever, but here was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed, nor would they have been appropriate. <br /><br />the story is tender, and the message is uplifting. the characters are honest, brave, earnest, sympathetic, and likeable. it's a nice little film. 8/10.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
