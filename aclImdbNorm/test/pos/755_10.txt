charlotte beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there. she is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor. is dr. masters all she seems to be?<br /><br />don't look in the basement is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me. the acting is excellent, my favorite performance being by betty chandler as allyson the nymphomaniac. the chills just jump right off the screen. you probably won't have to say "it's only a movie, it's only a movie", it isn't that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which i do. it is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed. axe is another cheap film that is looked down upon. maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and/or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience. but i think that after people see this movie, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish.
