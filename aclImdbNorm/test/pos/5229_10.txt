i first saw this film in video form. even on a television screen, the vistas were impressive. seen on the big screen in its full glory, it must have blown people away.<br /><br />as one or two other comments have pointed out, the story of the early pioneers and how they got around the problems of terrain etc on the road to oregon is as authentic as any film can be. it therefore shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth - something that today's film makers should take heed of - reality is enough.<br /><br />the plot relies on the struggle of man against the elements and hostile natives. subplots are few and simple. but the basic plot is enough. elsewhere i have reviewed paramount's rival to the big trail, fighting caravans. in spite of having a more sophisticated plot, and having better actors, fighting caravans lacks the breathtaking scenes.<br /><br />the big trail should be compulsory viewing.
