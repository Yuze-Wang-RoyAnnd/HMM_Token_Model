everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job. this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i've seen in a long time. the acting, writing, cinematography, music, visuals, everything was top notch. as an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian films and gymnastics), i was so unbelievably pleased by this film. it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board. hearing the q&a with the cast and crew was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what's really important. and the writer did a hell of a job, as well as directing and the editing was awesome. thanks so much for making a great film! thanks also for the line about 'if you're going to slap a label on yourself, it would be bisexual'. i'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight, it's wonderful to see bisexuals getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community, and it was nice that labels weren't even necessary at all in this film. what an ending! just when i thought it couldn't give me more, it did. beautiful work and my applauds to all. i will spread the word, this is definitely a film not to be missed!
