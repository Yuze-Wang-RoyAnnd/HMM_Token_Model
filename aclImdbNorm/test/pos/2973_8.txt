i too saw this movie when it first came out. i was a teenager at the time, and i saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. i remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. the cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. the boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. i thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. i have not seen the movie since and i wander why it has gone to the wayside. i would love to watch it again to see if it was as good as i remember. the elton john sound track was excellent.
