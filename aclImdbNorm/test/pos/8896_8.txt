as much as i hate to disagree with the original poster, i found asterix and the vikings quite good, and a huge step above previous attempts at animating everyone's favorite gaul.<br /><br />for someone not familiar with the famous comic series, the show would be hard to follow, but for those of us in the know, it's a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />first and foremost, the animation is far superior to earlier comic adaptations. you can tell they took the time and effort to really recapture the look and feel of the comics this time around.<br /><br />as mentioned, there are elements of other asterix titles in the movie and i can see how fans of those titles might feel confused or a bit let down, but i was so caught up in actually seeing one of my favorite childhood comics faithfully represented on the screen, any qualms i had were minor by comparison. minor spoilers follow...<br /><br />asterix and his faithful friend obelix travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief, who has been captured by the vikings. the vikings think that by the boy teaching them about fear, they will be able to fly, thanks to some poorly worded advice from their village druid. in the process, the boy meets the viking chief's daughter abba and they fall in love, etc etc etc... if my explanation sounds convoluted, don't worry.. the plot is easy to follow! definitely a great buy.. you can purchase this dvd through amazon france, but be warned.. your dvd player probably won't be able to play it. i had to change the region setting on my computer to view it..
