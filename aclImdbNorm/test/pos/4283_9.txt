how on earth can people give this movie a low rating. unbelievable. the performances of wilkinson and watson are so full of merit that i can only imagine that these detractors were weaned on blockbusters and porn. (if this sounds bad-tempered, it's because i just wiped my original 400-worder just now) i was so impressed by tom wilkinson. all hail the guy. this is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill. his development as an actor from the full monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing; one of the best things to happen in film-making in the last ten years.<br /><br />emily watson is somewhat less commanding, due to that glint in her eye that says 'see me? this cheeky woman, here? you can't guess what i'm going to do next because i don't know either!' it seems to be something she can't help showing us in every role, but still, she's an actor of terrific ability and presence. she is very sexy here, as she needs to be, and fair play to her for this: this is a screen quality that normally, for me, she doesn't have in previous films.<br /><br />as you might expect, rupert everett, required to play an upper-class late-30 something who could give tutorials at phd level in how not to give a toss about heading to hell on account of total selfishness, delivers. he is so thin here, throughout the movie, however, i'm worried for him. linda bassett's housekeeper is also excellent: a smallish role but with a major plot twist to deliver, she makes you ponder how much talent we have in britain in terms of character acting. i want to see more of her.<br /><br />the narrative arc is fine; it's an interesting enough plot, given that no-one in film-making seems to be trying to convince joe public that there's nothing new under the sun, though it does stray towards 40s melodrama in the last 'reel.' but never mind that - this is a terrific 80 minutes worth of anyone who has half-a-brain's money. congrats to julian fellowes on his first directorial effort: o how we need more films of substance like this. he shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel, telling a story with much effectiveness and subtlety. and congrats too on conjuring an immense display of the film actor's art from mr tom wilkinson. what a geezer.<br /><br />t.
