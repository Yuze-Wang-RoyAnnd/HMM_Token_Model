little gus is a ten year old delinquent. he runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. his goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called motorama. he has to find all eight letters in order to spell m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a. dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. he runs into some deranged lynch like characters. most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that god will see it. later gus gets a tattoo and an eye-patch for his injured eye. he becomes one of the most rebellious bad-ass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen. this is no kid's flick! look for cameos by jack nance, flea and drew berrymore. be warned although drew is on the front cover, she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds. also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching david lynch territory, you may want to watch it a couple times. "motorama" was written by joseph minion, most well known for his screenplays for "after hours" and "vampire's kiss" so enjoy this depraved surreal road-trip of fun!
