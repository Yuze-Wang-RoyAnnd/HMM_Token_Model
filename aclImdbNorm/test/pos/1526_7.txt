the good news: the director is reportedly committed to the cause of amnesty international and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. the plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites. the not-so-good news: 'original' is not everybody's buzzword when visiting the movies or video stores. also, noted critics like mr maltin and roger ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a play from stage into cinematic form. if i remember correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale stowe's character has written and which has made her a possible subversive and suspect person in the fictitious place where the story takes place. her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by rickman as the intense, manipulative interrogator. since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether, the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention. in the end, i found the whole thing fascinating. not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. it's nowhere near a masterpiece like kieslowski's 'a short film about killing' or as explanatory as 'dead man walking'. but if you're into those films or any of costa-gavras political thrillers, you may appreciate this one as well. just don't expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences.
