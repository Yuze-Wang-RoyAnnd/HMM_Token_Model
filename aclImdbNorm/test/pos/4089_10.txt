why take a perfectly good original drama, based on a perfectly good novel, and remake it as a quasi-musical? and cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent? somewhat akin to "showgirls" or the two most recent "star wars" films, "lost horizon" is full of unintentional laughs. who can forget sir john gielgud smiling uneasily in his dali lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance to the republican party ("family")?<br /><br />or sally kellerman warbling lovingly to george kennedy, doing her best cher impression as she hops from one rock to another ("every little thing you do")? and my favourite, bobby van embodying the strength of america's education system ("question me an answer")? i can't wait for the dvd release, as hopefully it will contain comments by liv ullmann, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!
