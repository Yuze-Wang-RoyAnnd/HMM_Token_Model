goldie hawn's depiction of a simple young lady caught up in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played with such relish by walter matthau, that she won the best supporting actress oscar for 1969.<br /><br />the film, however, is another tribute to ingrid bergman. rarely, did we ever see her in a comedy and she literally kicks up her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is thrust into a scheme for matthau to tell hawn that they're married.<br /><br />it is such a joy to watch matthau and bergman fall for each other here. theirs is an accidental love affair in the making.<br /><br />as matthau's friend, jack weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well. rick lenz gives ample support as hawn's newly-found boyfriend as well.
