things i like. steve zahn as gus, nails the part, copies robert duvalls mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to gus fans. (some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well). karl urban, looks grim and tough, but can crack a joke and smile too, which t.l.jones did in original series. the gear, the guns, the clothing, all accurate, or very close to period accurate. i'll never forgive costner and duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in open range. the comanches, they are actually riding bareback, rather than hiding a modern saddle under a navajo blanket. and they aren't painted as politically correct peace loving pastoralists, but as a proud warrior people. there are some dumb scenes, but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows.
