a 2006 online poll of japan's top 100 favorite animated television series of all time, conducted by tv asahi, placed this series in fourth place. that tells you everything you need to know. so go and watch it.;) i won't comment on the story, simply because i don't want to ruin anything. i only urge you to keep watching after you saw the first episode. the animation is really good and above tv average. the best thing about this series is, that there is finally something new. i mean it's not groundbreaking but still it offers a fresh new idea and likable characters. you won't regret entering suzumiya haruhi's world.<br /><br />and the best thing a movie is coming soon
