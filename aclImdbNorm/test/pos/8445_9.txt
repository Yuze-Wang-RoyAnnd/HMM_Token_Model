as long as you don't mind paying a little more attention than you normally might for other films, this is one of the best "thrillers" you'll ever see. the film portrays an incident that might occur in real life; nothing in it seems fictional at all, in fact. it also portrays how people might react in real life.<br /><br />in fact, it portrays these so well that is seems like real life. combine that with the lack of a soundtrack, and you've almost got the best news-like movie you've ever seen. jane fonda and jack lemmon are particularly good in this late-seventies masterpiece, evoking concern on her end and genuine tragic pity on his end. i highly recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers.
