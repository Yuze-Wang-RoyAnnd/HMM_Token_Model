okay, so ghoulies 4 is kind of bad. and it doesn't really even have the ghoulies in it. and the acting is bad. the storyline is stupid. but i forget to mention how funny this film is. it is so campy, and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy. there are only 2 ghoulies in the movie, and they don't really seem to be in relation with the ghoulies in the other film. but they are pretty funny. and funny thing, that jonathon graves returns for this one. if you saw the first, he was a character in that. in my opinion, this is better than the first. there are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one which is in a grocery store. "attention k-mart shoppers!" watch this if you enjoy bad movies. it's so bad it is good. and did i mention barbara alyn woods is hot?
