hoot is about these three teenage kids who try to save a bunch of burrowing owls. now to me i thinks that right they stand up to whats right and whats wrong. in this film a kid name roy eberhardt ( logan lerman)moved from montana to florida. and once he gets on the bus a bully name dana matherson starts bullying him finally the next day roy punches the bully and runs off the bus chasing the mysterious running boy. after all that roy finally meets the running boy who's name is mullet fingers ( cody linley) well actually his nickname his step-sister beatrice ( brie larson) gave it to him because he can catch mullets with his bare hands. anyway mullet fingers and roy becomes friends and they join together with beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. mullet fingers is the one behind all the vandalism's that happened there and also later he gets bit by one of the dogs that put there to guard the construction site. so they stood up to the muckle that was driving the bulldozer and everybody got to see the owls it turned out to be a great movie because it showed where kids can make a difference in life by standing up to whats right and whats wrong. thats what is great about this movie. it teaches a lot to everyone about wildlife and how important it is.
