i accidentally bumped into this film on cinemax while channel surfing. i must admit that what attracted me was christopher walken. and the setting was the kind i would like, so i started to watch it. at first i expected a serious drama film, and it seemed like so for a while... until i started to giggle here and there, and before i know it i was laughing so hard all through the film. i really like how subtle and light-hearted it is, but still has a huge impact on the audience. the plot is very simple, and it's far from trying too hard to be funny like many hollywood "comedies" are, yet it almost had me rolling on the floor. a must see for a nice evening rest, or any time in that case.
