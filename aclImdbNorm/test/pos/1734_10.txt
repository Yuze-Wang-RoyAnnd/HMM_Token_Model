i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it, excellent,their entitled to that opinion but the new series isn't quite there yet, it's getting there. it's definitely good.<br /><br />first the good things. the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who "battlefield" was aired.<br /><br />one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who (except when they tried to cancel in the 70's and 80's). however, the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test it's good, it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws. some of the stories "dalek" were very poor. i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series.<br /><br />"aliens in london" was by far probably the best episode so far, it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including "boomtown".<br /><br />now the other bad things, the companion, rose, billie piper, isn't great. she's actually quite annoying but as is dr. who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part.<br /><br />christopher eccleston is pretty respectable, he's started to catch his niche. he tried to play the character, straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows.<br /><br />continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well, paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back.<br /><br />aside from that though the series overall is pretty good, i haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring, so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series.
