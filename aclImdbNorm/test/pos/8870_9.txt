i don't understand this movies distinctly average rating!?<br /><br />i really really enjoyed it, i even stayed up till early morning to finish watching it on late night t.v<br /><br />there are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. danny devito played a gem, quite a feat considering he was directing as well. his down trodden laughable at times character was brilliantly written and was surreal in a absolutely believable way. there are people like that, owen was just on the line without crossing it.<br /><br />billy crystal's comic syle and sense of timing was perfect for his role. his frustration/comedy was interesting and captivating and what's more... you could understand his feelings. to really feel like you know a character is hard to achieve from the writers point of view, to find the right actor to pull it off is an art in itself and both were achieved here thrice over.<br /><br />thirdly, who else could have played momma? there is no one that can play this part so well. there is a style there unlike any other, something you love to watch, i found myself waiting for her to appear on screen... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because momma's character was, again, so on the line without crossing it that it was excellent to watch.<br /><br />and what's more? a happy ending with new found friendships, no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life... without a big hunk of cheese tied on the end.<br /><br />brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great film.
