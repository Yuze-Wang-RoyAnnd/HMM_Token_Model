i've seen jimmy stewart in all the regular roles, but the "spirit of st. louis" was reported to be one of his favorites. a poor box-office performer when released, this film has been largely forgotten today. telling the well-known story of lindberg's famous flight in 1927, stewart seems to be badly miss-cast at first, and his well known voice never lets you forget who you're watching; it feels like george baily all over again. but stewart obviously worked hard on the role and he does everything right, so before long you don't care anymore that stewart was 20 years older than the man he's portraying. stewart's lindberg is so gosh-darn, all-american, apple-pie likable that you get caught up in the story, and you realize that stewart intended to portray lindberg with all of the aw-shucks, yankee-know-how he could muster up. lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the u.s., and stewart seems determined to keep up appearances.<br /><br />flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather dull story moving along, and i was struck by the subtle references to faith that were scattered through the film; lindberg trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly, only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs, or lindberg refusing to carry a proffered st. christopher medal to save weight on the plane, only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after he'd crossed the atlantic. for me, this is a film not about a man's epic journey into the unknown, but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel.
