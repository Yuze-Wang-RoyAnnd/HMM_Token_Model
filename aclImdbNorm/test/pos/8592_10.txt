when it comes to political movies i usually come out feeling empty. they generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of batman movie.<br /><br />but with lumumba it is the first movie i've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence. there were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest. this is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something. especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you, you cannot rule on what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you.<br /><br />that's why i disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad, i think they come of too idealistic, (the belgians want the perfect colony, lumumba wants a perfect unity congo, tshombe wants wealth and riches, america wants the perfect ally against communism, russia wants the perfect aide for communism). and the congolese? they come off used and abused, ( best example in the movie when g'en'eral janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another.<br /><br />this movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country. their intentions might be good (or at least in the characters opinion), but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of congo. i don't think anyone is bad in this film, i just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.<br /><br />overall, it's not just the best political film, it is a great film in general. acting is fabulous (eriq ebouaney as lumumba was perfect casting i really believe him) script flawless, editing perfect pace, and production value higher than i expected for a central african film. a must watch.
