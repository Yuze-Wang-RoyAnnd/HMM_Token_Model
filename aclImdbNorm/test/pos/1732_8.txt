i have just watched the season 2 finale of doctor who, and apart from a couple of dull episodes this show is fantastic.<br /><br />its a sad loss that we say goodbye to a main character once again in the season final but the show moves on.<br /><br />the bbc does need to increase the budget on the show, there are only so many things that can happen in london and the surrounding areas. also some of the special effects all though on the main very good, on the odd occasion do need to be a little more polished.<br /><br />it was a huge gamble for the bbc to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they must be congratulated for doing so.<br /><br />roll on to the christmas 2006 special, the 2005 christmas special was by far the best thing on television.
