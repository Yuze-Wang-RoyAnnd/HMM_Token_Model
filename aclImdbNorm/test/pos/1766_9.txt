i was surprised, "once more, my darling", had not generated enough votes (at this writing) for a "user rating". it's a "screwy" comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years. robert montgomery's mission places him in some very improbable situations, and he's just the man for the job. he maintains his trademark "befuddled" look throughout the film and hysterically, too. ann blyth plays his precocious/eccentric pursuer, who assumes a relationship that does not exist. her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname "killer", but remains cute and cuddly.<br /><br />among the glut of "b" movies from the late 1940's and 1950's, "once more, my darling" is a standout. this one is worth looking for....
