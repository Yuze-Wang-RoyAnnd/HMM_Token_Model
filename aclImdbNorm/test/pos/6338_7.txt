apart from being a clever and well-marketed variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general, i always somewhat considered "supernatural" as a massively giant homage towards the genre through the decades. although not always noticeable to younger viewers and/or people who only have an interest in more recent horror films, each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtler references towards classic and influential titles. from that point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the 'creepy vehicle without a driver' type of films, and even more specifically the 70's milestones "duel" (steven spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "the car". being an avid fan of these two films, i enjoyed "route 666" a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings. the episode opens tense and atmospherically on a remote missourian road, where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel. the victim's daughter, cassie, happens to be dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls the winchester brothers in for help. the brothers can't prevent two more similar "accidents" before discovering the ghost-truck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial dispute of the 60's, involving both of cassie's parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town. some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label "route 666" as one of the weaker entries in season one, mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of dean's character. he's usually the strong silent type, whereas here he's confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here. to a certain level i agree with the racism debate, but it didn't bother me that much, really. the writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck, and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as i'm concerned. concerning dean's emotional vulnerability, i can only state it's admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters. dean's behavior towards cassie sheds a whole new light on him, in fact. besides, what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks. it's an impressive and overpowering vehicle, producing blinding lights and grisly engine noises. in case you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned "duel", you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in "route 666".
