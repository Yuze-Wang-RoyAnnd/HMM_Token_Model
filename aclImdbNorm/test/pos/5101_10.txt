i wish i was first exposed to this in a movie theater when it was first released, as some of the commentors had been. it really is a treasure. to be fair i have not seen any other version of goodbye, mr. chips and neither do i want to. to me this stands as a perfect version. i first saw it on tcm years ago and never forgot it. i had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend yesterday, although i had recorded it from tcm days earlier. there were portions of the movie in which both of us were teary-eyed, it really is a moving movie.<br /><br />and shouldn't that be what movies are all about?<br /><br />the music is beautiful, the film was shot wonderfully. the acting is top notch. and the story is delicate and timeless.<br /><br />one of my favorite movies of all-time.
