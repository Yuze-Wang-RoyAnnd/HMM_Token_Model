a few years ago, while i was renting some movies, i came across subspecies 4, ended up watching it and actually kind of liking it, we need a good vampire gore flick that doesn't hold back. but when i went back to the video store, they said they didn't have any other subspecies videos, unfortunately, the same went for any other video store i checked out. i gave up, until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies films and i got to watch them all last night and i'm hooked. i am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series. i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for, i've been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies filled that spot. radu is one of the coolest vampires on screen and almost gives nosferatu a run for his fangs! <br /><br />radu is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone, his birth rite, the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength. three american girls who are studying romanian history and culture bump into a man, stephan, who offers to help. they stay at radu's castle where we find out that stephan is radu's brother; radu seduces and turns two of the girls, but stephan falls for one of the girls, michelle, and will do anything to protect her.<br /><br />subspecies is a fun series, despite the cheesy effects, it makes it in some ways more likable. plus radu was a perfect villain as stephan was the perfect angel like romantic vampire. the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie. this was also the first in the series, the best part is, the sequels are just as fun. i would recommend this for a scary movie night, watch it in the dark, radu is sure to send shivers down your spine, or even your neck... ok, cheesy joke, couldn't resist.<br /><br />7/10
