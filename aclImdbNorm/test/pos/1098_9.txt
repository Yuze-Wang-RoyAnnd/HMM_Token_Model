this was a random rental at the video store. but i was impressed from the start. wooden camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director. the film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid south africa. the young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. the film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich'es. the musical score to the film adds body to the film without being obtrusive. after watching it the second time, i tracked down the dvd on amazon and have been happy ever since.
