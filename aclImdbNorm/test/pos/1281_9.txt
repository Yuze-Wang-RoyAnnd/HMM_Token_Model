christopher nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. the film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'memento' and quite rightfully so. <br /><br />following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. no fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. the actors, all unknowns to me and i suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. they were all believable and that's all they need to be. the film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it's very rewarding in the end. the film's a little short to be a full-length feature but any additional length would've ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would've been diminished. though short, the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive (imo): an intriguing beginning, an exciting middle and a surprising end. <br /><br />i dare say following is almost as good as memento, his best film by far. the scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films, the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good.<br /><br />this film was made with a mere $6000 but the quality is much higher than most( almost all) million dollar box-office hits. the use of b&w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience, following is primarily nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses :-). and what skills they are...rarely have i enjoyed writing so much as in 'following'. even pi doesn't even come close imo, though it's also very good.<br /><br />this is a film surely not to be missed by any self-respecting movie-lover. if you liked memento, 'following' is definitely for you.
