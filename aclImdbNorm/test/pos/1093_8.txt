it is by far the most definitive film on the police force which i have seen. although not directed by ram gopal varma, it has all the elements of an rgv film. dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). the chemistry between nana and the don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. and so are the small events like an insider not giving information to imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to nana when he is out. the change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully. the first half keeps one absolutely engrossed, moving like a documentary with nana acting like a mentor to jatin explaining to him the intricacies and philosophy of the work.<br /><br />overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in indian cinema. definitely not to be missed.
