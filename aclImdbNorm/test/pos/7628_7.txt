stupidly beautiful. this movie epitomizes the 'so bad it's good' genre of films. <br /><br />the only two talents in it are richard boone and joan van ark, and only boone is any good. it's kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as paladin should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid. while he turns in a fantastic performance, i couldn't help but feel that he so outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that he shouldn't even have been there.<br /><br />the effects in this film are laughable, but fun. the idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is b-movie gold. when the 'triceratops' gets killed, watch how it falls. it's clear that the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best. he falls to the ground, well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit.<br /><br />speaking of 'suits', there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur, in this flick. it seems to have some kind of stealth technology, since bunta (reputed to be the best tracker in the world) twice fails to notice it until it's within biting range of him. i don't know how all the prints are, but in the version i own, the tyranno's roar contains godzilla's trademark bellow.<br /><br />this is loads of fun, to watch, if you like bad movies. i love them, and especially bad monster movies, so i consider this the gem of my collection. if bad movies are your thing, definitely get this one.
