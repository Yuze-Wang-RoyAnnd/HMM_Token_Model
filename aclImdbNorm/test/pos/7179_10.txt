the second film about the adventures of the gaulois pair asterix & obelix is 10 times better than the first. the humor is great (and irreverant) and the script is well executed taken from the original 1965 comic book by goscinny & uderzo. i fell asleep with the first film (although i am a great fan of asterix) and was reluctant to see this sequel, but i am glad this movie proved me wrong. excellent comedy for everyone. highly recommended!
