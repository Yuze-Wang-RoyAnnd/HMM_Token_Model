i am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film. quite obviously, it is an investigation into the nature of modern love. it is suggesting that love is love while the going is good, but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first, and if the going gets tough, they get out and go onto something else.<br /><br />this observation has generational implications, as it is coming from generation x, makes comment on generation x, and in the end is aimed at generation x. it expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that which the baby boomers, the parents of generation x, had engendered in their marriages and family lives, and which gave generation x the innocent and bountiful childhood it ultimately enjoyed.<br /><br />the generation x attitude to love is, of course, flippant, but as decisions are made and commitments are broken, the biggest casualty are the children of generation x. this is made clear at the end of the film, and was so pungent i took a week to recover from the shock i received from this epiphany.
