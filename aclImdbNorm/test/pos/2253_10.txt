"everything is illuminated" is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. it absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. jonathan safran foer is played with candor by elijah wood. he is in search of his paternal heritage in the ukraine. his travels bring him in contact with alex, played very well and with extreme humor by eugene hutz. his grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by boris leskin. if one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to mikke, a real dog who is called sammy davis jr. jr. by alex and his grandfather. they also call him the "seeing eye bitch". the cinematography is spectacular. the colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. it is a film worth the time and emotional investment.
