i just finished screening el padrino in germany. a great film. we look forward to seeing more films from mr. chapa in the future. it was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic. the ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. seeing a film with great quality truly outlines chapa's serious potential and his adept skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. chapa has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "blood in and blood out" and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control. something that few film makers can afford.
