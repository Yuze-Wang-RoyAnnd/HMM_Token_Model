this is a really cute movie. i had a massive sleepover (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. they watched it twice! don't let the rating fool you. you have to be 13 or older to rate a movie on imdb, that eliminates the movie's target audience. if you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13, i guarantee they'll enjoy this movie. <br /><br />sort of a gender reversed "notting hill" set in high school. aaron carter plays a famous pop star who is failing his privately tutored classes. his mom sends him to a "regular" high school with the ultimatum, "pass high school or no summer tour." taking the advice of his manager (former pop star david cassidy) he befriends the smartest girl in school (alana austin) with plans to cheats off her. look for the humorous and insightful janitor (another former pop star lief garrett).
