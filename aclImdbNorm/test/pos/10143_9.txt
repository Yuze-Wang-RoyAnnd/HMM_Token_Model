the man who knew too much{1956}is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in 1934 with the same name. in my opinion, his later effort is far superior. many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn't have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre. in both films the plot is essentially the same, except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in marrakech . it tells the story of a married couple {james stewart and doris day}vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man, that is very curious about their past. it just so happens, he's an agent that's looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader.then he gets stabbed in a marrakeck market because of it being found out that he's a spy,and proceeds to fall into stewart's arms.dying,he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot.stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son.the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day,in a straight dramatic role,as worried and frightened parents.this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals.the direction by alfred hitchcock is top-notch.the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute.the scene in albert hall is a classic.the original is so slow-paced and drab.i don't know how people can compare the two.just watch the remake and you'll enjoy it.i give the movie a 9 out of 10.
