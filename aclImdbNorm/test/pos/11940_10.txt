a stolen shipment of vigoroso, the mexican viagra; a beautiful girl who is trying to rebuild her life and to leave her husband, a boss of the italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old sweetheart. this is the plot of "the shipment", a country comedy located in small town of paradise, arizona. despite its simply and classic story, the movie (directed by alex wright) has its fun moments: when elizabeth berkley (as candy porter), looking at a vigoroso green pill, says: "what"s this? a mint candy?". or when the girl enters the sheriff"s house and finds him completely naked. or when the vigoroso shipment ends up in that lake, at the final sequence... the cast offers some nice performances: by matthew modine as the sheriff of paradise valley, who still loves his old girlfriend; and by elizabeth berkley, who"s character still loves her old boyfriend... the supporting cast, including nicholas turturro, paul rodriguez (as the mexican jos`e) and g michael gray (what kind of teeth...), makes a pleasant work, too. not an oscar material, but not so bad. a fun comedy without pretence.
