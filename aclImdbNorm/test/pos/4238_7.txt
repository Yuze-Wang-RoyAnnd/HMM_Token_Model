this is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. this is a john hughes movie meets the devil's rejects. i really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. i thought jennifer tilly played tiffany really well and brad dourif in chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. actually they're the only good parts of the movie. i got rather bored with katherine heigl and nick stable's scenes. it's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day. but chucky and tiffany were great to watch and i really liked the black humor to it. i thought it made the movie stand out more. if you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out.<br /><br />7/10.
