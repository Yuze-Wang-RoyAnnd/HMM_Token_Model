this film was adapted from the well known sutra on journey to the west where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of buddha.<br /><br />though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend, it did however, managed to bring in romance and fun-filled humorous scene.<br /><br />this real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. one of his student, the monkey god managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time, but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon, locked up in that particular dungeon.<br /><br />the monk awoke in a small village where he found mei yan (the so called ugly serpent daughter) who fell in love over him at first sight. though ugly, she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him. however, a quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with mei yan following the monk. problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse.<br /><br />the rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal, but suffice to say, this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book, it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what journey to the west and the love obstacles really mean.<br /><br />towards the very end, the whole summary could be described with only one word, and that is love. the monk went to show the heavenly gates, the celestial palace and buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers.<br /><br />a wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket. there would be of course, no regrets, at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film.
