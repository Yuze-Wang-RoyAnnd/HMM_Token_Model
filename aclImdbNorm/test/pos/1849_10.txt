i love this movie!!!<br /><br />this beautiful, charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally. the storyline is very enchanting, and it brought me to tears in several touching moments. duchovny and driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. this one's worth watching more than once, and showing to all your friends. i'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?<br /><br />i give this a 10 out of 10! spectacular film! (and this is coming from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies aren't even worth watching.)
