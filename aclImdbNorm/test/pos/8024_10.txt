<br /><br />when i first heard about this back in 1997, over coffee with friends, i decided to check it out. the only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local cinema's.<br /><br />that didn't stop the enjoyment of seeing a simply great movie, with a top notch cast in aidan quinn, donald sutherland, and ben kingsley. the whole movie, kept me glued to my seat. <br /><br />i simply found no flaws in this great movie, i give it my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. i am very proud to have this in my collection.<br /><br />10/10 ( i don't hand this out lightly).
