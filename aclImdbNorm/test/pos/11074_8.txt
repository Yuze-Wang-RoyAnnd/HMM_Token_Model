this is a very realistic movie. it's the most realistic i've seen on urban youth. the actors were great. i will look out for more films by gomez. i had never heard of the film until someone mentioned it recently. i bought it on dvd. i was impressed. i haven't seen anything come close to life as i know it in philadelphia. this comes real close - in fact, one scene where there is an accident (i won't spoil and give details), reminded me of a nearly identical situation in philadelphia. at first i thought gomez took the scene from that real-life event, but then i realized that he made the film a few years before that situation. i also agree with the point that this film didn't try to broaden its appeal by putting in hollywood crap. gomez also directed "laws of gravity" - i am eager to see it.
