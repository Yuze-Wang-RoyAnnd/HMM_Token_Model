man, is it great just to see young and the restless star melody thomas scott as something other than flighty nikki newman! a doctor with a brain no less! and super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous lorenzo lamas instead of victor newman!<br /><br />mel plays a college professor of micro-biology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break, only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus. handy for her there is the hunky character played by lorenzo, who has a daughter just her son's age.<br /><br />mel shines, as does lorenzo with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple. interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism talk. worthwhile seeing, especially for y&r fans.
