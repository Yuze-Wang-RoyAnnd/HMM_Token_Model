i went into "night of the hunted" not knowing what to expect at all. i was really impressed.<br /><br />it is essentially a mystery/thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be driving past. the two become fast friends and lovers and together, they try to figure out what is going on with her. through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool.<br /><br />i really liked the setting of this one: a desolate, post-modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings. very metropolitan. groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity.<br /><br />surprising it was made in 1980; seems somewhat ahead of it's time.<br /><br />8 out of 10, kids.
