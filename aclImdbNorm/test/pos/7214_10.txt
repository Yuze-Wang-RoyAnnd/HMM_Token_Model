i think it was francois truffaut who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies, or the agony of making movies. this flick is definitely of the first type. tromeo and juliet is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. the zany zeal fuelling this shakespearian shenanigan is infective. i don't think i've laughed so hard since i saw monty python and the holy grail. it's that good!
