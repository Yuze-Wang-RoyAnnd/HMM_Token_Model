the english patient not only has it all (doomed romance, tragic war, great characters) but it has it in a way that no other movie does. it is a spellbindingly tale told through flashbacks featuring amazing performances by all involved, somptuous visuals, characters we care about, and the most rapturous love story ever told. a cinematic landmark, the best film of 1996 and one of the very best of the 1990s.
