this film is great! being a fan of "the comic strip presents..." i just knew i would love this film. and love it i do. i finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year. however i was annoyed to find that it had been cut! so i'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version.<br /><br />anyway, the film is about dennis carter (adrian edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (dawn french) by claiming to be a drug dealer. however, dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked! so dennis turns supergrass but the trouble is he doesn't know anything and starts to make up lies and dig himself into an even deeper hole! the irony of all this is that there is drug smuggling going on down in devon.<br /><br />this film is not as funny as i expected but it is still a really good film with some good laughs and a great soundtrack. it also has the best scene ever in a british film (robbie coltrane's walk across the pier set to "two tribes" by frankie goes to hollywood.<br /><br />so if you are a fan of "the comic strip presents...", of any of the cast members, or a fan of british comedy see it a.s.a.p!!!
