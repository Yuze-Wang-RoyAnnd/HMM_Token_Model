david "master of debonair" niven plays the big boss (ivan) who preys upon the unfortunate richard jordan (pinky) by forcing the hapless ex-con to exploit his ill-found new position in a bank. elke sommer (miss pelham) most effectively provides the female interest, whom pinkie cannot simply cannot resist.<br /><br />it seems they were unable to decide on one name for this film so instead they used four .... makes sense ???<br /><br />sadly, this turn out to be one of niven's last roles.<br /><br />overall, this film is fun and well worth watching if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night tv screenings.<br /><br />
