this film is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist, forget that it's set in paris and forget it's noir. the film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. it portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. it's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft. it shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. now all things considered put on top of that a daring 28 minute sequence with not a word spoken and set in gorgeous paris with truly great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and that last scene ...when you look up and see those trees... wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques... it is a master piece in my view and i'm glad to have seen it.
