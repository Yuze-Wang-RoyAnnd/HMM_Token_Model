i think this movie was made as good as it could have been. with only 4 months and a 52000$ budget - i'm surprised this wasn't worse. if you are not to care about the cg or special effects, this movie is great.<br /><br />okay, the movie is not that well made (i'm sure it could have been but, you try to do better in only 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting.<br /><br />don't trust me when i say that this movie is good, cause i also find the 1933 king kong to be good.<br /><br />i must confess that i didn't watch the complete movie either... i might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there...
