when i was five years old, it was my favorite television show. i remembered it was on channel 11 at 2pm everyday. the show's premise was simple with carole and janis as the hostesses of this children's television show. they sang songs and read stories to us as children. it was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over. i remember sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. the show taught us how to count, add, subtract, and the alphabet. for thirty minutes a day now, i learned something new with paula and janis. i remember those days as pleasant memories and now i hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories, inexpensive props, riding the swings, and talking to puppets. the set was ideal and simple but it was carole and janis who made it worth while while. i miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the magic garden. life seemed so much simpler and better. now, i hope the kids today enjoy the show.
