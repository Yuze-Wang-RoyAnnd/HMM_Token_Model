first, let me say that i find films like shawshank redemption and green mile, and most of spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning. although, national velvet on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe-worthy moments, i thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing and bawling throughout the film.<br /><br />the premise of the plot, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the grand national is certainly as implausible as could be, but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory. the characters have depth and grow throughout the story. ann revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an american film. her interaction with the good-hearted donald crisp is funny and sweet. while liz taylor tries a bit too hard to be even cuter than margaret o'brien (she succeeds btw), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. mickey rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainer.<br /><br />this is far from a perfect movie. some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated (the kids' antics, and rooney's scenes at the track and in the pub for example) but it doesn't matter. the plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unsaid. we don't have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments - sometimes more is less. the final scene is a great example of this - the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill in.<br /><br />strong understated performances, rounded characters, pithy dialog, intelligent and internally consistent storyline. we believe in the characters and are moved by their story. yup - they just don't make them like this any more...
