i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art, because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature. that said, the simplistic notion that ingmar bergman's great 1968 film shame (or skammen) is merely an anti-war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex, and highly nuanced, film. compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors, persona and hour of the wolf, shame is seemingly a more classic film, in terms of narrative. but, the key word is seemingly, for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of persona and the gaudy horror film homages of hour of the wolf, it is one of the best films ever made about war- and not as an anti-war film, nor a pro-war film. as such, it has to rank with wild strawberries as one of his greatest films, as well as one of his best screenplays, if not the best.<br /><br />although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it, it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. in it, max von sydow and liv ullman play jan and eva rosenberg (perhaps a nod at the infamous american spies, whom many european intellectuals felt were innocent), two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out, and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island, content to working in a greenhouse. the country they live in is unnamed, as is the island they live on, although the film was made on bergman's small island of far"o, just off the northern end of the swedish island of g"ottland. it seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province. this is all left deliberately hazy, as this war is meant to symbolize all wars. this is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen, as the credits roll. these include quotes from hitler to vietnam era american military figures. after early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life, and then the coming of war, where even old men are conscripted, an aerial attack ravages the rosenbergs' land, as enemy jets fly overhead, dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an agent orange like nature. one plane is hit, and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree. jan, who starts off the film as a sniveling coward, refuses to go and help, so eva goes alone. jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot. it seems he is, indeed, part of the invading, or possibly rebel, force. a bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot, then advise the couple to leave their home, as the invaders are near
