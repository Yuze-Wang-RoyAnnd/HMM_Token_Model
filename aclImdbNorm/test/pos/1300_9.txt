let's face it.<br /><br />this movie is incredibly clich'e, as korean romance dramas and movies go. first of all, there's a pair of long-lost siblings, one of which falls in love with the other. second, there's a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall for and fight over her. third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes his life.<br /><br />still, i like this movie.<br /><br />without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. but because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is engrossing--i honestly couldn't stop watching. kang dong won, despite his pretty face, gives an awesome, heartrending performance, not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun, plus all the supporting actors.<br /><br />i'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
