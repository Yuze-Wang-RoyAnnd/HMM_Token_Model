overall, this is entertaining and odd film. don't try to make sense of it. there are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with, but robert cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this "fugitive"-like story.<br /><br />unlike the popular tv show and then 1993 movie, this fugitive isn't looking for a one-armed man, but a two-armed nazi saboteur by the the name of "frank fry." cummings ("barry kane") gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in los angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it (fry) to clear his name.<br /><br />the first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. then priscilla lane ("pat martin") enters the story, and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog. director alfred hitchcock often did that with his female characters, to the point i wonder if he had a clue how woman talked. lane's character here was a little lame.<br /><br />actually, the villains played by otto kruger ("charles tobin") and norman lloyd ("frank fry") were the best, in my opinion......just fascinating. kruger's acting and dialog was especially good.<br /><br />if you haven't seen this film but saw hitchcock's well-known "north by northwest," you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it. instead of a climactic scene at mount rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the state of liberty. as usual, hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view.
