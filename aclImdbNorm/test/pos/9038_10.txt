this film was set, filmed, and premiered in oxford, miss., the hometown of w. faulkner, the locale of the 1948 book. most of the extras were locals. i've been to oxford, and it has greatly changed. this film features will geer as the sheriff;he was later blacklisted. it was the writers and actors of social dramas such as this film, and grapes of wrath, that were targets of the huac a few years later. i don't recall if the actor playing the young mallison boy (claude jarman jr) did anything after the tv series centennial (1978), but he was terrific in this earlier film. and do not miss elizabeth patterson who later played in little women.
