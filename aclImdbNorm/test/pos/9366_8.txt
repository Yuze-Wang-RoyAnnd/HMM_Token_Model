edward dmytryk's "crossfire" is a rare film coming from the hollywood of the 1940s. this was groundbreaking territory for mr. dmytryk and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, john paxton, decided to do with the novel, in which the film is based.<br /><br />if you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.<br /><br />richard brooks novel was about the killing of a gay soldier. in the movie, the subject matter was turned around to prejudice against jews, a theme that was taboo during that time in the american cinema. it's to mr. dmytryk's credit to have had the courage to get involved with this film project, at all.<br /><br />the movie is an outstanding piece of film making because the way the director presents it. obviously influenced by the film noir style, we are taken to the washington of the post war. the opening scene about the brutal murder of samuels shows such unusual cruelty being inflicted to a decent man, who we don't know yet, or why has been killed, but who didn't deserve to die in such horrible fashion.<br /><br />the basis of the murder is prejudice, pure and simple. we realize how in the mind of an ignorant man, the mere fact of being successful and different, plays in the mind of the assassin. samuels stands as the sacrificial lamb, the same way the gay soldier is the victim in the novel. the parallels are well drawn.<br /><br />this film makes compelling viewing because of the brilliant star turn of robert ryan, as montgomery. mr. ryan was an actor that always played interesting roles, but never so well as in "crossfire". also, there is a great appearance by gloria grahame, as ginny, the prostitute with her heart in the right place.<br /><br />the rest of the cast play as an ensemble. robert young, as the police detective in charge of the investigation plays is a decent man who has known prejudice first hand in his own family and speaks loudly against it. robert mitchum plays a cool sgt. keeley who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it. sam levene is excellent in his small role of samuels.<br /><br />this is a film to watch because of it probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance.
