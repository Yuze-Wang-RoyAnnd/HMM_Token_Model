i first saw this in the 70s on syndicated tv and admired its production values, which were high tech for the time. the remastered video is rich and colorful, far more intense then the pale 35 mm tv prints. this movie deserves more attention: it paved the way for ufo, space: 1999 and even star wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets. sure, the story of an alternative anti-matter planet earth has been recycled a hundred times since star trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious european flair for design: from the rolls royce space engines to the "euro sec" letterhead business paper, jfss or dopplegangers as it was called in europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of europe in space in the shadow of the superpowers. gerry and sylvia anderson's ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the american astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger earth, and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence. a mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great barry gray, the john williams of britain.
