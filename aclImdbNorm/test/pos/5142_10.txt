if you read the book by carl hiaasen, the movie follows pretty much true to form, with a few minor changes for hollywood. in my opinion this is a great family movie. luke wilson (officer delinko)pretty well steals the show from an all-star cast that includes robert wagner and jimmy buffet. the kids in the movie do a great job led by logan lerman, brie larson, and cody linley.<br /><br />brie larson is maybe a little too petite to play beatrice. i pictured a bigger girl, maybe 6 foot, 175 lbs, in the role of beatrice. this might have made her more believable in her role of beating up dana. they should have developed her "tough girl" character more, and had her bite through a tire, or kick a soccer ball through a person. she is very pretty, and i understand why she was cast, she is a box office attraction.<br /><br />this is about as pg as a movie gets these days, no sex, and very little violence. this movie is a parents'dream come true, a movie with a strong environmental message, with kids that have deep appreciation for the beauty of florida and its wildlife. it shows how adults have fallen short in the stewardship of our planet, and that our children can demand better. one of my favorite lines in the movie is when mullet fingers says, "florida could use some mountains like montana. florida is so flat there is nothing to stop developers from clearing it coast to coast". also, the photography of florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialog. as a family movie with kids ages 5-15, this is a great movie! as a bonus parents' will be entertained, especially if they're "parrotheads".
