this film by fridrik th'or, director of children of nature, is powerful. it has great music by sigurr'os and good acting. it shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. there are many good jokes but the humor is dark. if that is not a problem then you should see this film. note though this is not a comedy but a drama.
