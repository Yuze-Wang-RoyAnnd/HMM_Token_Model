when i first saw "before night falls", javier bardem had just been nominated for an academy award. i thought "he's got it!". he didn't. i watched "mar adentro" last night. please give it to him this time... this is an actor. convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. see also "los lunes al sol" and you will understand what i am talking about. he is an absolute chameleon and i swear it's not only the result of make-up work. this movie is so beautiful, so well done, the characters are so real. congratulations to alejandro amen'abar (how about a best director nomination?). i also have to mention the make-up artists. i can't think of another word but magnificent. i really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves. as far as i am concerned, it already has...
