despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of joe d'amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. the author of the original book "emmanuelle: the joys of a woman", emmanuelle arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. her boyfriend, played by zombie's al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married! orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women, one of whom is played by arsan herself. despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "i can see you better naked!", the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less-than-spectacular finale. much like d'amato's emanuelle and the last cannibals, the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe, but don't get your hopes up, there's no violence at all in this film, and not much sex either for that matter. just a lot of nudity and silly dialog. i couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film, if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by.
