it's very easy to figure out why the new professionals was a dud, at least in new zealand: it didn't just follow in the footsteps of the original, it followed bodyguards, which out-professionaled the show considerably with its boss-and-two-agents formula. cmdr mcintyre was a latter-day george cowley: tough on his team, but one who would defend them to the death against others. the shadow the show cast was huge.<br /><br />well, not as huge as it should have been in the uk. here, it was networked in prime-time. it was even marketed in the promos as, 'they are the professionals.' someone else obviously noticed the difference. we were fortunate enough not to have this show released in different regions at different time slots.<br /><br />it was the high production values that sealed the deal for me. as other reviewers have noted, it followed the great british tradition of the one-hour actioner, but blended in personal elements at the same time. there's a slight undercurrent of something developing between liz and ian, though that never distracted one from the real plot. most episodes were based around inflammatory diplomatic incidents, the sort of thing that helps spooks along from time to time.<br /><br />unlike many 2000s shows, the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy-pants photography or over-stylish direction. directors like christopher young kept the pace up and did their job. they made use of good locations, making bodyguards slicker than if it had been shot on back roads and alleyways. it was contemporary, it would still stand up beautifully today, and it was one of the better examples of the british actioner in the 1990s, showing that the uk can still do them better than anyone else.<br /><br />maybe except for the germans and their cobra 11.
