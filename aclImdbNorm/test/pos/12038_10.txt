this is a hard movie to come by in the us, but if you can find it -- and you're interested in the life and music of percy aldridge grainger, you're in for a treat. it's quite historically accurate. richard roxborough's grainger looks astoundingly like grainger at this period in time. emily woof's karen holten is quite a bit prettier than the real karen, but that was an inaccuracy i was happy to discover (!). i think what really struck me though, was how well roxborough captured grainger's outrageous personality. barbara hershey's rose was also a treasure. if she looks considerably younger than rose did at that period, it is more than made up for in how well she captured rose's obsession with percy. it's an easy film to recommend. (i should note that when she saw "passion" my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) grainger and his music, but she was totally captivated by the film.
