the summary line is some men's wet dream for the ideal woman ... ;o) seriously though, back to the movie, which has classic cinema written all over it (pun intended and quite literally shown in the picture, too as you'll see)! <br /><br />how could someone make a silent movie in this year and age? it's not completely silent for once (take the music for instance). with great cinematography is the answer. and it's no wonder that it did win prizes (as another user stated) in this area! but it's also sometimes it's downfall. although the pictures are great, it sometimes delves too much in them instead of moving forward (plot and time wise). if you can cope with that, than you'll enjoy it even more than me. i haven't told you anything about the story, but i'll never do that, because i don't want to spoiler anything for you ...
