i always enjoy watching this cartoon, with sylvester trying to catch tweety on a train, rather than at grandma's house. it's actually a standard fare, but entertaining, especially when tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. when you watch this over and over, like my little boy did (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you begin to notice some things.<br /><br />throughout this short, the position of the baggage car changes on the train, either 3rd, 4th or 5th, and in long shots not at all. the engine has either the number 651 or 814, or none at all. the coal tender has either the number 99, or the letters "s.p. & q.r." on it, or no number or letters at all. the coaches carry the "s.p.q.r." without the "&" in long shots, and then in closeups it has the words "southeast and western."<br /><br />all of this doesn't interfere with the story, but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully. <br /><br />still this cartoon is among my favorites with sylvester and tweety.
