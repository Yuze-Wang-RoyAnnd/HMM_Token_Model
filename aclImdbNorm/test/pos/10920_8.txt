in & out is a comedy with a simple premise. it admirably succeeds in the mission of being funny and entertaining.<br /><br />the comedy in this film ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime, physical comedy exists alongside dry humor, with a nice veteran turn by bob newhart. kevin kline is predictably in excellent form in this film, alongside tom selleck not playing to his expected "square jawed" leading man type. mr. selleck plays his humor well and displays a nice sense of comedic timing. the cast makes this film successful.<br /><br />not all films with homosexual themes are made to advance some sort of sinister, hidden hollywood liberal agenda, in point of fact this film was simply made to entertain, and if any part of this films makes the viewer think, then it was a byproduct of the well-acted work by a terrific cast of professionals. frequently tongue-in-cheek, i found myself laughing at the right moments. a solid "b."
