what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no "stars", with absolutely no bad performances, not one poorly delivered line of dialog, and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm "heart" of the protagonists in the story? <br /><br />it's a jewel, a diamond, a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west. a west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp, but by the spread of the everyday man and woman, farmers and ranch hands, merchants and miners and lumbermen, whores and barkeeps, and entertainers of the day, some looking for riches, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. <br /><br />it is, perhaps, a very spiritual story, though not promoting any particular religion, for even the non-mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr. act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people. and in true biblical fashion, like david and goliath or samson and the philistines, they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan, likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden, and regretting what it is they have to do afterward. it's a sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at.<br /><br />nowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat, whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown stetson, who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope. to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a colt revolver to tuck into his waistband. when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns, i simply reply, "snakes!" after all, isn't the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve? <br /><br />fifty five years later, especially post-911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then.
