an odd beam of light penetrates the bedroom of dr. craig burton(arnold vosloo)and his wife sherry(jillian mcwhirter)as they are making love. about two hours are unaccounted for as they embrace seemingly unharmed. under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist dr. susan lamarche(lindsay crouse), craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens. sherry resists this notion as absurd and is quite happy to relay news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant. ecstatic after their trying for ages to get pregnant, sherry is frightened at craig's persistence of the fetus not being his..this stems from a check on his low sperm count with odds especially high that he could in no way have impregnated his wife. awkward, troubling experiences with the fetus inside her leads sherry to some scary discoveries..her doctor, david wetherly(wilford brimley)finds that the ultra-sound gives some unusual results of the developing infant's appearance, but it's craig who notices that it resembles an alien! sparks ignite cutting out the electrical equipment, even shutting off wetherly's pacemaker! through hypnosis, sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but lamarche believes her problem is psychological not physiological. with no one believing his wife's alien impregnation theory, craig turns to sociologist dr. bert clavell(brad dourif), whose work is in the studies of alien life and abduction. but, bert is reluctant to help craig who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm. tragic results occur as lamarche and others try to keep craig from his goals of "cutting the thing out" believing he is mad. craig will still pursue his task trying to drag bert down this path with him.<br /><br />grim, absorbing horror tale about one man's struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist. thankfully, dourif's character isn't some quack nutjob but an intelligent doctor who wishes to learn more, but his pursuit of the truth of aliens isn't hostile..he does hope to learn from sherry, but isn't incredibly demanding in this goal. the story is told realistically..it's easy to understand why others might deem craig off-his-rocker. vosloo doesn't take the character too far, but expresses the distress of his current situation. how can he save his wife from this hostiles and prove to others that he's not nuts? mcwhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table being probed and molested by these things. crouse is fine in her limited, but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem out of control psychologically. the monster effects are icky and effective. i think the film works quite well and director yuzna deserves credit for restraining himself for this film at least. the final twenty minutes as craig tries to perform his "removal surgery" with a scared bert watching the crazy situation escalate is nail-biting.<br /><br />you know, fans of "fire in the sky" might dig this flick.
