one of the funniest films i ever saw in the theater back in the early '70s, and sadly, it's only been on tv a few times since. this movie should be released on video. it's sellers at his sleaziest, slimiest best as a crooked hospital administrator. great cast, great movie. if anyone has a good vhs copy, i'd love to buy it.
