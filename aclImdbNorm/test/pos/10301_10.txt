this movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. there are only three locations (the school, the store, and the coach's house) that are really used. it's primarily at the coach's house, however. a movie doesn't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.<br /><br />four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up. one is rich, important, and has no real love outside of money. one wants to be mayor again, but his competition is turning him sour. one wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. one is a traveling alcoholic.<br /><br />first off, i love the actors in this film. they've all been household names to me. they proved their worth here.<br /><br />one of the most pivotal moments is when tom, played by gary sinise, blows up on the coach. he yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game. his blows the coach's whistle and yells back his catchphrases - "forgive me father, for i have sinned!" it's amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you.<br /><br />highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn't need shiny effects to interest them.
