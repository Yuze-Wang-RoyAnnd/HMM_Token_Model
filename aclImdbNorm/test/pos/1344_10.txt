it's hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends. i have a bunch of shasta daisy's in the back yard which i lovingly call my "chuckle patch." my friends laugh at me and look at me like i have 2 heads. it would be great to see this series on dvd for us folks who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle patch! where kids tv today is compiled of violent cartoons, characters who do magic, or a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea, the magic garden was real in the respect that it taught us good values.<br /><br />i will hold fond memories of carole and paula, and the chuckle patch.
