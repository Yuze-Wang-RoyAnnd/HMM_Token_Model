deep blood... its one of those movies you here about and you say not another italian jaws ripoff! well, deep blood is far from that. it is a cheap as film making can get and on the other side it is creative as well. in jaws and all the other shark films we all have seen or herd about they all use fake made sharks, well in joe d'amato's film he takes a new approach by using all stock footage for his shark scenes. this is one of the many reasons i like deep blood so much is because it didn't use stock footage.<br /><br />in deep blood an ancient indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark, in joe d'amato's shark classic deep blood.<br /><br />it seems that a native american elder once warned a group of youngsters about this great evil in the sea, and years later, the friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their coastline. now it's up to the remaining few to make sure that this monster is killed, even if it means heading out to sea to do it.<br /><br />joe d'amato directed and produced this film under his company the filmirage. released in 1989 and was later used in bruno mattei's cruel jaws: jaws 5, along with many other shark films. joe d'amato's shark entry is a great film and any joe d'amato fan of shark movie watcher should give it a try.
