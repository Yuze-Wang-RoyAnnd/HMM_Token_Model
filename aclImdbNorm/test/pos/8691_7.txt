why jessie matthews, one of britains top musical stars, was in this movie in between her sparkling "the good companions" and the classic "evergreen" is a good question? when i first saw it i was really disappointed. i wanted to see her sing and dance - she was billed as "millie - the non - stop variety girl" but there was more stop than variety.<br /><br />now i see it as a good little drama.<br /><br />it is about a bus crash and the stories, leading up to it, of the people on the bus.<br /><br />apart from jessie matthews, who is great as millie - sir ralph richardson plays her fianc'ee ( yes, that's right).<br /><br />edmund gwenn - who went to hollywood to co-star in lassie movies and also with natalie wood in "miracle on 34th street", plays a grumpy businessman. gordon harker is his very annoying partner.<br /><br />emlyn williams - who wrote "night must fall" was the black - mailing villain and frank lawton, who went to hollywood and appeared in "david copperfield" and "the devil doll" is the young man in trouble. sonnie hale who was married to jessie matthews at the time played the bus conductor.
