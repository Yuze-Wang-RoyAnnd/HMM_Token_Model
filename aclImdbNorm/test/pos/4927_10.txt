caution: potential spoilers ahead!<br /><br />"steven spielberg presents tiny toon adventures" was always one of my favorite cartoons growing up (heck, it still is). and this movie perfectly captures everything i love about the show and puts it in full-length form.<br /><br />beautifully animated by the tokyo movie shinsa studio (wb outsourced every "tiny toons" project, and this was the best studio to handle the show), the movie starts at the end of the school year at acme looniversity, the renowned cartoon college where buster and babs bunny (no relation) and their teenage toon peers learn from the masters of animated lunacy, the looney tunes. after the final bell, the movie splits off into five different plots. buster engages babs in a water gun fight that culminates with a bursting dam and a tidal wave, sending buster, babs, and elmyra's dog byron downriver on an overturned picnic table in search of adventure in the deep south. plucky duck talks hamton pig and his family into letting him come with them to happyworldland, "the happiest place in the western hemisphere", but he has to put up with an excruciating car ride and the threat of a chainsaw-wielding hitchhiker. elmyra's cat furball finally runs away, but she isn't daunted...not when there are plenty of "aminals" to play with at the acme safari park. fifi la fume devotes her summer to hunting down her heartthrob, movie star johnny pew, in the hopes of getting an autograph. of course, the hotel he's staying at is nearly impenetrable. and shirley mcloon sets up a fortune telling booth on the acme acres boardwalk...and lets her guard down on her day off when fowlmouth takes her to see the horror flick "skunkophobia".<br /><br />all these story lines are sidesplittingly hilarious, and some of them even overlap in the end. the only complaint i have with this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the tiny toons roster - dizzy devil and mary melodie have only one scene, gogo dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the film, and montana max, sweetie, calamity coyote, and little beeper are nowhere to be found. still, they're excusable flaws in an otherwise perfect film. this movie is pretty rare today, since it's over 12 years old and has never been released on dvd to my knowledge, but i highly suggest you track it down - anyone who's a fan of warner bros. animation, either classic or contemporary, needs to see this movie.
