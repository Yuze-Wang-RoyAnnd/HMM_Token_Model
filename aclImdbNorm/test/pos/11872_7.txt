this is a very good black comedy, with a great view on how different people have a different perception of the same situations. the three main characters each met a girl named jewel, played by liv tyler, who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men. each of the three men go through the same situations, but when they tell of them to other people, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. that is a very good concept, probably not entirely original but it works very well in the movie. the plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. the acting is equally good, not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league. the comedy is very black, pitch black in some scenes, and a lot of people will definitely be offended by it, but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it. overall, this movie is not for everyone's taste, but most people who like black comedy will probably love it, as it is definitely one of the better black comedies. 7/10
