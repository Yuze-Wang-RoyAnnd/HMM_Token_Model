i watch many movies, but presently my genre number one is asian horror. i have just bought this dvd and i initially found "janghwa, hongryeon" an intriguing but confused film, since i had not understood many parts of the story. but i saw in imdb board a message titled "explanation of a masterpiece (all your questions answered) faster load", written by opiemar, and i was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story. i would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in imdb to help and guide other viewers.<br /><br />in the end, i agree that "janghwa, hongryeon" is a great korean film, but i do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, like this film demands, and without the great support of opiemar, i would not be able to understand the story as a whole. i intend to see this movie again in a near future. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "medo" ("fear")
