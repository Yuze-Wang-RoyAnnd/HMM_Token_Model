sally and saint anne is a very funny movie. the first time my mom told me about it i was 7 and saint anne had just been the saint i had for my communion saint. my mom knew this, so she told me to watch this with her. i did, and have seen it many times since because it is really funny. aunt bea from the andy griffith show was in it and sally's grandfather was the guy who played santa claus in miracle on 34th street. so, there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too. there is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away, and sally keeps trying things with st. anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. that includes a boxing match with hugh o'brian who plays her older brother. this is a good and funny movie that i still love.
