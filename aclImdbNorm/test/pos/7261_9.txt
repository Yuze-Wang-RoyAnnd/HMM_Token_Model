i've seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it. and what do you know, i actually liked it! it has a new twist of the 18th century england. although the music in the dance scene were obviously modernized and also the colors of liv tyler's clothers (although it is pretty!), it fit quite perfectly.<br /><br />if you just want a good time, you should check this out. very different from other 18th century detailed films.
