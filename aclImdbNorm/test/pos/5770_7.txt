if folks were really this stupid i could be the srw - supreme ruler of the world. in this one knotts plays a dimwitted bean counter for some little jerk water town run by a group of crooked simpletons only slightly brighter than he is. when things appear a bit shaky for the crooks they go for a frame-up of the patsy figg. plenty of laughs as knotts does his usual bumbling, stumbling act. i especially appreciated the extension cord scene; asininity at it's highest level.
