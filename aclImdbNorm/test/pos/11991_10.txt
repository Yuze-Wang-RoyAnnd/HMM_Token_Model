i have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage a travesty an unexceptable sequel is just unfair i mean what else could they have made for a sequel then. cause seriously i think it should have had a sequel (rodney dangerfield) says: hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing goffer and thats it thats the end of caddyshack even though the film rating on first one was (r) and the second one was (pg) it was still lots of fun .<br /><br />(7/10)
