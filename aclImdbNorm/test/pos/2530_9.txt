for me, this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based "z" channel when it was in service. and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one i did not want to accept.<br /><br />moving to los angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the "z" channel in its showing of international films. the three international films that stuck in my young head were "spetters", "beau pere" and of course this one, "pixote".<br /><br />this was the most shocking and saddest movie i ever witnessed in my life. this was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema: to entertain, and to inform. let me be honest..growing up in a small town on the east coast, i had no idea anything like this -- to this extent -- existed. all i knew from south america was brochures of fabulous brazillian vacations and that columbia had a lot of drug trafficking.<br /><br />then comes a film like pixote. sad. disturbing. unflinching. scary. you're watching: children. those that need shelter, love, understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs, sex, robbing, stealing, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc. their survival is hard to watch with other street children, prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how can things like this be allowed to happen in this world.<br /><br />pixote is not a film for entertainment, it is a film of information. it shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these daily street children.
