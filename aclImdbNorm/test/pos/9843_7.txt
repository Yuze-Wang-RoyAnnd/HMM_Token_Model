james cagney (the yankee doodle dandy boy) was just starting his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a boys reform school which is being run by corrupt politicans. the reform school inmates are underpriviledge minors from the streets of new york, like the "east side kids" who were poor and uncared for during the great depression. in the final scenes, there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden. i noticed that they did let the horses out of the barn first. this film is not shown very often and i really can understand why!
