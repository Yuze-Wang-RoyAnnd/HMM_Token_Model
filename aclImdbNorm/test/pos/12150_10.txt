this movie is simply one of the best movies i have the privilage of owning. it took me years to come up with this movie and it was well worth it. the movie is meant to be anti-drug propaganda but turns itself into the opposite while not even halfway through the movie. the relished look on the faces of the players as they receive their bounty of drugs is pleasing to all those who observe. untill the final phase pf their drug induced lives, heroin comes for its say. yikes! this is the anti-drug message that was so fabulously sought. the soundtrack for this movie kicks butt! by far it is one of pink floyds best albums ever! if ever the chance, take a look, listen, and moment to witness a spectacularly made movie.
