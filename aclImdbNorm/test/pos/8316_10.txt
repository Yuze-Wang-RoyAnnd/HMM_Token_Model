spoiler warning<br /><br />i got this dino-documentarie on dvd at christmas 2004. i had longed to see it and was by no means disappointed. the score is memorable ( my<br /><br />favourites were the "sauropod" theme song and the "winters coming" song ). the effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. you actually learn something too ; stegosaurs may have been able to pump their plates with blood. female t-rexes might have gone on a killing spree before laying their eggs. i know there's a lot of people who thought this was based too much on speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess at. and there is a lot of hard-core, undeniable fact as well. we know that some dinosaurs travelled in herds, we know that diplodocus swallowed stones to grind up vegetation in their stomaches. despite this "speculation" the series did extremely well. so well in fact, that it spawned a followup, a prequel and several specials. if you're a dino-fan, then this is for you. it makes jurassic park look small and weedy.
