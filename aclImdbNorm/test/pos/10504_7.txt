<-----minor spoilers!-----><br /><br />a woman gets pregnant, but not by her husband. she develops 'something' inside her, or at least thats what her husband thinks. they go through a lot of hard times, while she is on the brink of a nervous breakdown. the husband contacts an ufo professor, and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her.<br /><br /><-----minor spoilers!----><br /><br />the story could have been a bit better, or at least be made less predictable, but the movie is catchy and it got me and my sister hooked through the entire movie without a problem. the acting is very good, and the filming is much better than normal, if you compare this to your normal b-alien movie. the effects are good, and something is happening every second of the movie. the characters are really likable, and apart from a stupid nurse in on'e scene, they are all very convincing in their roles.<br /><br />i thought it was a good movie, and can recommend it, if you like alien/monster-abduction movies!<br /><br />7/10 - the story could have been a bit less predictable.
