i watched fantabulosa! because over the last few years michael sheen has become one of my favourite actors, and if you haven't seen him in anything before firstly shame on you, and secondly get your hands on a copy of either heartlands or dirty filthy love. this production did not disappoint - michael sheen transformed himself almost magically into kenneth williams, and gave a performance that was as tragically moving as it was skillful. not to take anything away from the other performances but like kenneth, michael truly stole the show. i don't know how he does it, but every performance i have seen michael give he seems to metamorphose until the character he plays is truly, utterly believable, and no matter how hard i try i cannot fault him. must go get my tea, enjoy!
