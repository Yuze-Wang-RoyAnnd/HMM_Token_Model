as a reviewer has already commented, this made for tv comedy is up there amongst the best football parodies ever. but....having failed to video it when it was first aired, i now find that it isn't around in any format. ok, so this has only polled 17 votes to date, but a 9+ average does seem to suggest something special. basically, i suppose it's a case of tough luck if you missed it 'cos it's no longer available to view !! aaaaaaaargh.
