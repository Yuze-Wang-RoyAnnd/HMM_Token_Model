soul calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time. and sciii is my favorite one of the series.<br /><br />the graphics are very well done. much bigger improvement over the choppy polygons in soul edge/soul blade. the characters have facial expressions, hair blows in the breeze and they even blink.<br /><br />soul calibur has always been known for it's interesting plots and characters and sciii is no exception. each character has his/her background story that is detailed and well done. my favorite character is chai xianghua. she's cute, she's funny and she's a strong female character. yeah, i know she wears pink and has a boyfriend (who she ends up saving btw), but there seems to be more to her than that. xianghua, like all the other characters, have flaws and upsides to their personalities, so no character is perfect, not even the good guys.<br /><br />the music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series. it doesn't sound kitchy (the vampire series) nor does it sound like old school porn film soundtrack (mortal kombat). the characters have their own themes and a lot of the themes are done to match the culture of that certain part of the world. i don't think there is a song on this soundtrack i don't like.<br /><br />another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character (create a soul). you could make him/her look as cute or as sexy or even ugly if you like. however, if you found a character customization that you like, remember to take notes, or else you won't remember how you created that character. i found myself being very addicted to cas.<br /><br />overall, i think soul calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time. it has everything i asked for. what more could i want?
