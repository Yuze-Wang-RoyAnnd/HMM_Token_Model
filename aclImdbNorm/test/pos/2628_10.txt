roy thinnes and joan hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama. the lush settings, the haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting film. i had seen it when it first came out on tv. once more it aired when i had a vcr, but i did not have a chance to tape it. would love it on vhs if someone has a copy. apart from the suspense (which is worked in beautifully) i feel the story is unique, and is pretty much true to the book, mrs. maitland's affair by margaret lynn. i would say that it was one of the greatly overlooked best films of the 1970's out of movies made for tv. i have given the film a number #10 rating, because it is done with so much originality. there is a true pathos and air of romance which has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit.
