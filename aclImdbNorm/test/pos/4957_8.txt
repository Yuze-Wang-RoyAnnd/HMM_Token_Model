i think that this movie is actually entertaining, although it lacks some features essential for this kinda' films. first of all, when doug and chappy start their mission, they take off with f-16b, and during the combat scenes, they are piloting f-16a. the second thing i dislike of this film is the ever-repeating f-16 rolling to its right to escape from missiles...why chaff and flares haven't been shown in any movie yet? third of all, once you see the f-16 almost empty of ammo, it appears again plenty of missiles... the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft ain't good either. however, i think that using iai kfir as opponent planes was really good, far better than the f-5 shown in top gun (but this movie isn't as good as that masterpiece).<br /><br />a funny movie, i love planes and i've seen it more than 3 times.
