contains spoilers<br /><br />this is a peter watkins film. if one has seen his bbc masterpieces "cullodden" and "the war game", one will recognize the style (and his voice) within seconds after the start. made in 1971 it is set in a very near future, when the vietnam war has escalated even more and now seems to involve china. nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with violently using drumhead tribunals (outwardly civilian with 'everyday citizens' as judges). because "prison building can't keep up", an alternative is introduced: the punishment park. delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunt in a hostile environment, in this case a 85 km trip through the californian desert at 100^0f. if they reach an american flag at the end without being caught by national guard or riot police, they will be set free, or else they have to serve their sentence (or be dead, as we will see). the film is made in a completely documentary style with three european teams covering a tribunal and the course of two groups already sentenced. scenes jump between the tribunal tent, the hunting troops and the hunted condemned. watkin's scarce off commentary gives us raw background information (time, temperature etc.). the tribunal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one side and a wide range of personalities on the other ranging from real terrorists over 'undesirables' to clearly innocents (e.g. a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies). the defense lawyer (who does take his job seriously) has to take abuse from both sides. what makes these scenes especially eerie is their resemblance to the rhetoric of todays administration to the detail. meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that the 'rules of the game' don't really apply. the question remains open, whether it is rigged from the start or arbitrariness by the troops due to those events that leads to the outcome (i suspect, it is both). at the end we are back at square one with the next group going to "punishment park". this description may indicate a heavily biased (or even demagogic) propaganda movie but that would be misleading. the behavior (all participants were nonprofessionals as usual with watkins) looks and sounds real (the tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real contemporary trials). i'd say that this could be sold as the 'real thing' without problem. with watkins's "the forgotten faces" the reaction was "we can't send that or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore (because this is indistinguishable from the real thing)". with "punishment park" it ought to be the same. effectively banned in the us as far as i know this is a must see that hasn't lost its power or its relevance (especially today).
