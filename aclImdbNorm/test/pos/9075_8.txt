my mom always told me to sit down and to actually watch this movie because it's one of her favorites, i never did for years until i caught one night on tv. this movie was great, i don't even know how to explain it. not only is the cast excellent (julia roberts, keifer sutherland, kevin bacon, william baldwin, and oliver platt) but the story is awesome. it's freaky but not too scary and it makes you think. i was left speechless after this film and amazed of how good of actors and actress all five of these people really are. where did william baldwin go, he's great. this film is a must see for anyone, if you haven't seen it go rent it, you will not be sorry. amazing!
