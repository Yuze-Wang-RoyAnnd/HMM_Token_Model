watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. there never is the perfect crime, and armored showed why. the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. the last hour of the film is very entertaining. matt dillon is still a very good actor. hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age. i would buy this movie. i give armored eight out of ten. not a christmas movie. did i write ten lines yet? nope! anyways, there is not to many action films. armored has a lot of excitement in it, which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy.
