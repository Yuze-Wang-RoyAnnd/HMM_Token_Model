a bunch of sorority girls make a new pledge spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. of course the recently deceased don't stay deceased for long and all hell breaks loose."one dark night" is an enjoyable 80's horror with some ghastly dead bodies floating around that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead psychic raymar.there is no gore and nudity,but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very eerie.the acting is solid,but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that raymar finally breaks out of his grave.the cinematography is impressive and the the mausoleum is a great location for the climactic events.the film takes so long to get going and this is its major flaw.7 out of 10.
