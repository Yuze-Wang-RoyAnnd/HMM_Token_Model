- a group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. in their escape, the bandits split up. the one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. three men have a different part of the "clue" that will lead to the gold. can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? or, will they kill each other first? - the plot is an obvious take-off of leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly. various scenes in the movie are also lifted from other films by leone, corbucci, and more. but, to me, it's done in a way that doesn't show disrespect to the original work. instead, any gun can play lovingly parodies some of the biggest films in spaghetti western history. the opening scene of three men riding into town and the final face-off between the three main stars are a wonderful homage to the sws that came before.<br /><br />- castellari adds a lot of nice touches of his own - the reflection in the spilled wine, the stranger's entrance with the vivid red background, and the playful way the gold is discovered in the end. although highly unbelievable, many of the fight scenes are well staged and directed. two fight scenes in particular (the market fight and the bath house fight) are very nicely done. he is also unafraid to try different things with his camera. tight close-ups, overhead shots, and shots around corners are all common in any gun can play.<br /><br />- another plus is the cast that castellari had to work with. george hilton is always good in these movies. gilbert roland is literally playing gilbert roland. and sw newcomer edd byrnes holds his own with the two sw veterans. the supporting cast features, among others, sw regular gerard herter.<br /><br />- any gun can play should not be taken too seriously. nice touches of humor can be found throughout the movie. if this is possible with an sw, it's more of a "feel good" movie - very reminiscent of some of the terence hill / bud spencer films.
