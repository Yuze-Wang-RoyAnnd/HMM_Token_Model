the theme song often goes through my head after all these years. i was never much of a tv watcher, probably because i was just entering my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life. but from the first episode of lawman i was hooked, and it is the only tv show i've ever scheduled my week around.<br /><br />intelligent, believable, well-written and well-acted, and john russell is still to me the most beautiful man i ever saw. (peter brown was no dog, either :o) <br /><br />i agree that it is one of the most underrated tv series of all time. i hope i can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch.
