pretty funny stuff. charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the trenches of world war one. daring because, after all, the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business.<br /><br />the gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear jerking. one successful scene follows another, as chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water. (that's where we got the term "trench foot" from.) probably the most ludicrous episode has chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling any number of german soldiers as they try to execute an allied soldier caught behind the lines. edna purviance, chaplin's main squeeze at the time, is a woman who cooperates with the americans and is saved from execution too.<br /><br />chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period.
