in the 60's cleveland television audiences could watch a episode of "flash gordon" as part of the ghoulardi show (11:30pm friday). this was the best mockfest material any of us in junior high had ever seen. we would have regular "sleepovers" (although we did not call them that) just to get in on the fun of watching this stuff with a group of friends. then the next week we would quote our favorite cornball lines from the latest episode.<br /><br />watching it today provokes much the same reaction. but if you can stop laughing at the dialogue, the lame creatures, the silly costumes, and the horrible spaceships long enough, there are some good things i did not appreciate the first time through. the production designers built some excellent sets, both the rooms and the laboratory devices. charles middleton's "ming the merciless" character was the all-time best screen villain, certainly up to that time and arguable better than anyone since. jean rogers is staggeringly beautiful.<br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
