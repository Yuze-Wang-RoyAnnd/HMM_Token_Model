this was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore which made it great, i would see it 1,000 more times, and paris hilton, d*mn she fine in that movie. but anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) adults like it to. you would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, it is awesome, i cant stop bragging about it. ever sine augest when i heard about it i bragged and bragged and in school i gave out flyer's saying may 6 house of wax see it. i got my whole school into it. but anyway, i would definitely saysee it may 6 house of wax, be there it be slayed.
