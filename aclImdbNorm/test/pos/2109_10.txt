without doubt, grand champion has the most impressive cast of "aaa" level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun, "g" rated family adventure. this is a must buy for every video collection! director barry tubb skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4h competition for the "grand champion" cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. joey lauren adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old emma roberts, whose on-camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt, julia. you can expect a lot from this young roberts-prot'eg'e' as is already proving itself in her new, hit nickelodeon series, "unfabulous."
