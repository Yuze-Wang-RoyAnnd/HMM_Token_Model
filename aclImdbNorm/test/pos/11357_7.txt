i'm from ireland and i thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any brad pitt or other american doing the accent. furthermore, i have rarely seen any british actor handle an american or canadian accent except for colin farrel in minority report. this film is a little film and it was entertaining. no it wasn't a blockbuster hollywood production but frankly i'm sick of that shite. i laughed more than a few times and had a good time. it was definitely worth the rental. the main character is a spoof on other hard british gangsters. at least that's the way i saw it. if you go in expecting a $100 million dollar production you'll be disappointed. enjoy it for what it is- a small entertaining film.
