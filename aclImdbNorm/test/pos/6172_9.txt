i've been a devoted imdb visitor for a few years. this is the movie that finally compelled me to write in a review.<br /><br />i caught this movie by chance (the opening credits happened to be scrolling past when i turned my tv on one morning). i thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons, all of which have been well covered by other reviewers -- the moodiness, the forgotten history of the czech pilots, the subtle charm of the supporting characters, the fatalism of the main characters, and the first person view during the battle scenes.<br /><br />but the element of "dark blue world" that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during combat (and this is a good thing!). while the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them, no manipulative shots of worried spouses/girlfriends were interwoven, every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers, and viewers weren't asked to swallow unbelievable james bond-esque pilot heroics. instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat. as comrades are shot down we are spared tearful howls and the typical (but audience pleasing) revenge based heroics. instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow pilot's fate -- in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and objectives at that very moment. we only briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the background roar of the engines as we, the audience, witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death. and then immediately 'we' need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival.<br /><br />too often in hollywood we're spoon-fed the emotions we're supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer's imagination. "dark blue world" maintains a sparseness that captivates and involves the viewer, allowing us to invest in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />excellent film, well worth seeing.
