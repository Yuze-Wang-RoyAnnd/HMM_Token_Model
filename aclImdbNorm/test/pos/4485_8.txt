odd but wonderfully original movie. genuinely frightening, creepy and ridiculous in equal measures. the setting of a high rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action. the thought of a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough but when the lead naive couple start cleaning up the old bed they find in this room the scene is set for some classic chills. the cast is fantastic. tanya dempsey really gets to chew some scenery after being undervalued in other full moon films. joe estevez proves why brother martin sheen is so much bigger in hollywood - his rolling eyes during the making the bed scene are really hilarious. charles band co-produced with stuart gordon and this really is an exceptional full moon/darkwave release. danny draven also directed hell asylum with dempsey.
