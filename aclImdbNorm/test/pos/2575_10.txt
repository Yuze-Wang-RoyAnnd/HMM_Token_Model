i really think this movie deserves some oscars! i really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from samuel l. jackson, and mainly by christina ricci!! i'm a big fan of hers, right since i saw her in addams family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! i love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...i think she is...and i love her eyes)!! the movie is about many things...people say that is religious...people say that it's about racism...people say that is about drugs...people say that is about nymphomania...well...maybe is a little bit of all that!! but what i truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is...what it stands for...and mainly were it comes from: life...heart...pain...sorrow...and above all...spontaneous feelings!! i hope you get to see it...if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells...this is a good movie to see...if your not...well...see it anyway...cant hurt that much, and you get to see christina ricci acting so horny!! she's a fox!!
