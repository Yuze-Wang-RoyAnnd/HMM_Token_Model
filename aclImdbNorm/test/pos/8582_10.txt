a fabulous film,which i have now watched several times over since buying the video only four days ago.yes i am a colin firth fan and colin was his usual talented, natural gorgeous self.<br /><br />the interaction between colin (matthew field)and fissy(sammy, nimi's 7 year old son) was very special and so natural to watch. they were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings. the scenes which i loved the most was sammy and matt sitting on the wall chatting and matt then falling backwards off the wall in an hilarious fashion (i won't reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot). also very hilarious was sammy quizzing matt about sex, colin and fissy were perfect in this scene and making what can be an awkward subject between adult and child just so natural. colins words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all! just brilliant. credit, of course, must also go to fissy roberts for his delightful portrayal of sammy. he played such a lovable and cheeky child character. the two actors were just perfect together.<br /><br />the interaction between colin (matt) and nia (nimi)was perfectly balanced and i couldn't agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch, displaying love,tension and of course passion. it was exciting to see how their delicate blossoming romance gradually unfolded, also showing how their cultural and social divides affected their relationship and was good to see how colin and nia sensitively portrayed matt and nimi discovering, accepting and overcoming these differences. it kept me fixed to the tv and guessing right until the end of the film. <br /><br />colins portrayal of matt's vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed, so much so, that i found it was difficult to watch when matt was so mean and childish towards sammy because he (matt) felt that sammy was getting in the way of his romance/relationship with sams mother nimi.one couldn't help feeling very disappointed, angry and frustrated with matt for treating sammy this way and this in turn threatening to spoil matts special relationship with sammy and nimi. colins special talent of 'getting inside a character's head' and displaying to the audience the different sides of a character, was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch. i must also mention that colin also has such a good rapport with young actors (see also 'my life so far'a wonderful and not to be missed film).<br /><br />i also loved the relationship between matthew and his wife jenny, both were excellent in displaying to the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly 'happy marriages' are quite what they may seem from the outside. <br /><br />i mustn't forget to mention the reverend whom i thought was very funny, in a serious sort of way! also nimi's mother and family were hilarious as well as bringing across the importance of nimi's culture and her situation.<br /><br />the downside, i can't really find a downside,but to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review, the only negative comment that i would make is that the script writers didn't explain in enough detail as to why matt collapsed in the car, there was only a vague suggestion, from nimi, of something being wrong with his heart. however, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film, far from it.i just needed to rewind the tape a little for a 2nd take.<br /><br />i felt that this film had it all, entertaining, uplifting and i loved the rich colours and sunny scenery.the film warmed up a cold winters day and made me smile :-)) all the essential elements were there,laughter,love,tension,sadness,anger,drama and a warm feel good factor, with, yes plenty of those delicious colin firth moments including a very soaked colin in a 'wet shirt scene',not to be missed by any fan, what more could a girl want;-)) <br /><br />i would strongly recommend this film, specially to any colin firth fans ;-)
