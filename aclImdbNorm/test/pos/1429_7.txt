a proof that it's not necessary for a movie to have a deep many-layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. even if the story could be expanded in many directions, especially in more sociological way (people lust for money) it seems that it's perfect just the way it is. through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen. <br /><br />but the acting for me isn't so good. with the exception of lindsey mckeon the others were average or even worst. in some scenes they just empty-stared in front of themselves. for exception of lindsey which was more convincing. it's a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying. <br /><br />7/10
