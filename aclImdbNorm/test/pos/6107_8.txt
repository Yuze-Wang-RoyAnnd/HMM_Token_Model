boasting the title for the sickest film ever made, pink flamingos is an undisputed classic. sure, the camerawork is shaky and off-center, the story is muddled and slow-paced, and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable, but pink flamingos has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can match.<br /><br />while this film is indeed an offensive one, reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it. only john waters can succeed in making rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagia, and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious. this movie must be seen to be believed.
