i am no ebert. what i am is a compassionate and i have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than i felt for leland p. fitzgerald. sorry if i do not offer a critique, but i see nothing but perfection in this film. i am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things i do, but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren't expecting. i've read that the character of leland was flawed. it seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the question this movie presents. i feel sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers this movie delivers. open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this leland p. fitzgerald show you a world that truly has a meaning. excepcional story with extraordinary acting. ryan gosling deserves to be talked about.
