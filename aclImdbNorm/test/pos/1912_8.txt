being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage, i have stumbled across this little treasure. action, romance, crooked cops, violence. its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right. i was in love immediately. then, a funny thing happened about the second time around. i became addicted. i thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind-of-movie.<br /><br />rudy ray moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. he didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. that's very commendable. it also shows he was making the movie for his self. i don't know how many of you have heard rudy ray's music, but if you haven't he has a whole slew of albums reaching into the fifties.
