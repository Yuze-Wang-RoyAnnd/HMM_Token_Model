with its rerelease by adv films, i've had a chance to watch "the giant majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night horror chiller theaters. guess what? it's a pretty damn good movie!<br /><br />the sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. i loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.<br /><br />this movie is begging for a remake in the new century!
