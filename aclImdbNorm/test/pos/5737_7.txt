why has ram'on(carlos fuentes)brought his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth? that answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father. what they come in contact with is in fact a relived episode involving another group of six, with five of them presumably meeting graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard(paul naschy)which occurred 20 some odd years ago. but, as they seek out a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as that horrifying moment in time replays as the group run for their lives, often in states of panic as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a various bloody ways. will ram'on and any of his pals survive this night of horror or becomes ghosts forever repeating the very same night like those before them?<br /><br />stylish spanish slasher has that professional gloss and potent, shocking violence to match. some witty exchanges between the characters..layered in their dialogue are pop-culture references to american horror films which might annoy some viewers. a demented naschy is really ferocious with the kiddies as he attacks them gleefully..quite a bloodthirsty maniac who carries out his violent acts with relish. i found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience. i don't think these tricks are necessarily needed, but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks. a minor diversion for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave. the twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt, but this might(..or might not)work considering how the story plays out regarding why ram'on's father is shown amongst those ghosts re-enacting those grisly events two decades prior. i will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if scrutinized in detail, but as a slasher flick, it's a breath of fresh air.
