this film was amazing, it was extremely funny and moving. damien o'donnell and jeffrey caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages. james mcavoy and steven robertson made this film brilliant. their acting was excellent, there was this real lifelike feeling between them, that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out. romola garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role. the story of these two physically challenged people and their carer is well put over, and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters as the movie goes on, it was especially upsetting at the end. i would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a truly heart felt movie, warning to the more sensitive viewer make sure you have tissues you will need them.<br /><br />again amazing film!!
