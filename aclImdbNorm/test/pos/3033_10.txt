superb story of a dedicated young teacher who sets out teaching minority children in an area off south carolina.<br /><br />jon voight is just tremendous as the headstrong, dedicated, idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal, who believes in stern discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques as well as a crusty old school superintendent, played with relish by the late hume cronyn. madge sinclair is the principal who loves her babies.<br /><br />as i'm a retired teacher, i could in some ways relate to this excellent film. the ignorance shown here as well as the lack of cooperation with officials is also quite apparent in urban areas.<br /><br />voight realizes that these children need far more than the traditional teachings of a classroom. he has them go out and experience life by themselves by learning outdoors.<br /><br />the end is a definite downer but so true to life.<br /><br />amazing that such backward students had a zest for learning and were well disciplined. i guess that answers my question. the behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment.<br /><br />the ending will just tug at your heart. it was memorable and so well poignant.
