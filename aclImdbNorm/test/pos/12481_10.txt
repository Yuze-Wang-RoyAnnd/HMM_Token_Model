one of the best film i ever saw.<br /><br />the performance of louis jouvet is fantastic. he really 'fill' his part, and this is wonderful. he's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part. <br /><br />and both suzy delair and bernard blier are good as standard french people, trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder...<br /><br />the story is breathtaking and well built. you can feel the ambiance of paris for that period (which is about 1930-40), between two wars... the clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors.<br /><br />all those things contribute to make a great movie.
