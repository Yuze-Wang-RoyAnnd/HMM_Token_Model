a brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history. the influence of this work upon tim burton's "nightmare before christmas" is readily apparent. one can only imagine how starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece.<br /><br />there have been very few animated films of this caliber. it's a shame that more people haven't seen this gem.<br /><br />apparently, imdb now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so this is the tenth line. this must be something new - but i really don't have anything else to say!
