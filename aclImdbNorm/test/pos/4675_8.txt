i enjoyed this movie. more than i expected. it has enough action, intrigue and locations to make it worth your while. while i can't quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader, he's gotten good enough to be a credible manager and that's ok.<br /><br />the superhero of the movie is the mini cooper. it's shown to have the speed, dexterity and muscle to pull off any job. and to handle a maniac driver like charlize theron's character.
