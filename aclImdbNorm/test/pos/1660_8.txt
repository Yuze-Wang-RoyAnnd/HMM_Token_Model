american expatriate jules dassin makes an award-winning french gangster film. the plot involves tony the stephanois, a hoodlum just out of prison, who takes his band of thieves on a $240 million jewel heist. unfortunately, his ex-wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named grutter, an italian safe-cracker named cesar with a weakness for women, and the missteps of his own friend jo cause the successful heist to turn into a bloody race against time as grutter holds jo's son hostage for the cash in typical "crime never pays" tragedy fashion.<br /><br />the "rififi" in the title is explained in a song to mean slang for basically violence and sex, and the full title, "du rififi chez les hommes" means roughly "some naughty in the house of men", which is pretty much where the fatal flaw of the characters take place. leave it to a gangster film to place most of the emphasis on the missteps on the women, but this time jo's wife gets the last laugh (if you could call it a laugh) when she predicts "all of you are just going to kill each other." the characters aren't the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak, but dassin still builds an extremely well-crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the utmost quiet, hide the goods, and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross-country cat and mouse game. in the mix are some very amazing photography and a fine attention to detail in editing, leading to a pacing and visual experience that well overstates the otherwise generic plot. it's not only easy to see why this is held as a classic, it's also easy to see why it's among the top 250 on the imdb: it's suspenseful, visually magnificent, full of sex and violence, and maintains that classy gangster attitude we film buffs like so much.
