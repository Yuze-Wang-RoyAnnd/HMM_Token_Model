is it a perfect movie? no. it is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it features vampires from space, naked beauties and the british army efficiency.<br /><br />when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may. actually, if it weren't for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie, i probably wouldn't have rated it so high, but given her sheer magnificence, i am now actually considering voting it up!<br /><br />lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now. imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci-fi story, but with completely over the top performances. i still enjoyed the movie tremendously (as well as mathilda may), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended.<br /><br />bottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie. oh, and did i mention mathilda may is young, beautiful and naked?
