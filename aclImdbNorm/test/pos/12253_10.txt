tv news producer, jane craig (hunter) meets tom grunick (hurt), an up-and-coming news presenter, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room. romance, however, is cut short, when it emerges that tom is, in his own words, "no good at what i'm being a success at", and jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where tv news is going. the rub comes when tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in washington.<br /><br />jane and tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance, but will jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to - and should she? aaron altman (brooks) is jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante. despite his obvious talent, aaron's career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills - and the classic good looks - to be the success that his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - tom - is becoming. he is also concerned that his good friend jane maybe falling in love with tom, despite her better judgement, as it becomes increasingly clear that aaron has his own romantic feelings for her.<br /><br />this central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a tv news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important.<br /><br />this is where most of the bite comes from with well-observed comment and scenes. one of many moments is a scene where tom meets the network's top anchorman, bill rorich (a cameo role for jack nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. in a film full of great lines and dialogue, long and short, you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two hands.<br /><br />the dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance. brooks gets the best portion of them, in line with his character, but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps over-heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room, should be listened to.<br /><br />hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was rightly (and not alone) nominated for an oscar, and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel-good, rom-com.<br /><br />brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too-smug-for-his-own-good, aaron altman.<br /><br />hurt, whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character, does not always convince that he is quite as dim-witted the character says he is or is supposed to be. he displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but i don't think hurt quite pulls it off. apart from when he tells us he "stinks" or "doesn't get it", hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that. otherwise it is an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations, but brooks and hunter slightly overshadow hurt's performance. it is the only negative thing i can say about the whole film, and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better, or come off any better, when next to hunter and brooks and their performances in this movie.<br /><br />support is ably provided by, amongst others, robert prosky, lois chiles and joan cusack, and there is also a bit-part role for christian clemenson of subsequent boston legal fame, and the briefest of bit-parts for joan's brother, john cusack, whose face you don't even see.<br /><br />james l brooks has provided us with many great tv shows and movies, and this film should rank up there with the very best of them. it may not have won any oscars, despite seven nominations, but it did win plenty of other awards, and turned holly hunter into a star.
