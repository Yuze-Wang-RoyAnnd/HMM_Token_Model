andaz apna apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time.both aamir and salman khan have acted brilliantly while aamir's acting was far better than salman.aamir khan is known as 'mr. perfectionist' in bollywood and he proves it in every of his film.<br /><br />the story moves around two young guys amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan) both are from poor families and are a big dreamer.they want to become rich without bearing any pain.so when they hear about raveena bajaj (raveena tandon) daughter of mr.bajaj(paresh rawal) who comes to india to find his bridegroom , they both fool their fathers to marry raveena bajaj and the journey begins.there is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny.paresh rawal is in double role (teja and mr. bajaj) and has acted brilliantly as he always does.shakti kapoor (crime master gogo) also adds a great comedy.<br /><br />this movie is a rib tickling comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of bollywood.
