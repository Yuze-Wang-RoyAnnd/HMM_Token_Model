definitely worth renting! good clean family entertainment. my 4 and 5 year-olds (and i) loved it. kept them on the edge of their seats. i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. it's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it. parts are predictable, but other parts are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. the movie doesn't have any really scary/creepy stuff, and so i doubt it will give children nightmares. it does inspire children to dream, which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children. rent and be blessed!
