the fact that this film was shown at london's barbican suggests to me that the print must have been acceptable enough for such a showing. now the question is, why isn't this long lost and important film available in dvd (or even vhs)? a large number of persons in europe and the usa have for many years hoped to see this film, if for no other reason than the wonderful music written for it by sergei prokofiev. what does one have to do to get such a wonderful production as this available for a wider public, not just patrons to the barbican at london? having been a devoted listener to prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this film, please, someone 'out there' do the right thing and bring it out as a dvd.
