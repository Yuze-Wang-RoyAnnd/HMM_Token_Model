this film tops the previous incarnation by a mile, taking everything to the next level. as always the jackass guys are purely unbelievable, and i personally laughed harder in that theatre than i have in a long time. like the first jackass, this isn't so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks. it is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. essentially these guys are clowns, debasing themselves for the amusement of others. and its great. the shenanigans are so low, outrageous, and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment.<br /><br />you can't rate this along other movies, its in a class of its own. and it shines. go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is.
