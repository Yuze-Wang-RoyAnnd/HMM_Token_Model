my friends and i saw the movie last night in austin at a showing for agliff (a film festival). this movie was one of the best i've seen this year. it was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and funny as hell! everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. texas is a big state - with lots of small towns - and of course, plenty of teenagers who grew up as "fat girls." i know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level. ashley fink and robin de jesus were awesome - they were so great in these rolls, it was like the script was written with them in mind. and speaking of the script, it was very well written (very believable), and ash is a great actor (his facial expressions alone made me giggle). it is an independent film - but don't let that fool you...it's a good one! seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring.
