a few years ago i saw this remake of the sixties classic with the mini coopers for the first time and i remember liking it a lot. now, about two years later it was shown on television and i just wanted to know whether i would still like it as much as when i saw it in the cinema. well, the answer is yes.<br /><br />the movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in venice, italy. the plan is flawless and the execution perfect. they escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. but there is one problem they didn't take into account: someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. but all but one survive and they are out for revenge. one year later, in los angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...<br /><br />the story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. this is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. the action is very nice, the landscapes and venice are real eye-candy, the story is ok and the special effects are stunning. even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. i must admit that i really liked what i saw and i give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.
