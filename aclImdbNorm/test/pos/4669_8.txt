here's another pleasant surprise. whenever i hear a movie is being remade, i cringe. movies such as gone in sixty seconds, and the day of the jackal, get remade and the results are less than stellar. so, when i heard that "the italian job" was getting remade, i expected it to be bad.<br /><br />well, i had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews, and finally see the movie, and was proven wrong. granted, it's not original, and predictable, but it's sure fun. from beginning to end, you are taken on one very fun ride. the scenes with the minis are great, and the characters actually enjoy themselves.<br /><br />so, even if there are some flaws, who cares as long as it's fun?<br /><br />overall, 8 out of 10. the only points lost are, maybe, the a few details and a slight lack of realism. but, you'll be having so much fun you won't even be given a chance to stop and notice.
