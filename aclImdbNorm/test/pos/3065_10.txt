just like all of mel brooks' other comedies, men in tights is hilarious. but in seeing this as an outrageous comedy, i think many fail to realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are acted so well. elwes is the well-spoken former british noble, lewis is an eternally annoyed king (i hope it's worth all the nooooooiiiise!), deluise is a fantastic godfather, roger rees is a worried and cynical sheriff.... the actors and actresses are so loyal to their parts that the jokes flow forth with ease. yes, we've seen this kind of comedy before, but the only comedy to achieve better character development, in my opinion, is the big lebowski. very very funny.
