a serial killer , carl stargher , has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell . he is apprehended by the fbi , but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water <br /><br />take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it . the magic of mark protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting . if i mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of stargher then sets up a different film entirely <br /><br />this wouldn;'t be enough to make the cell a different class of thriller but director tarsem singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller . the cinematography by paul laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but singh doesn't let it end there , things like costume design where stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller <br /><br />what stops the cell becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative . we see a third character , a fbi man enter stargher's domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing moments<br /><br />it should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable , then involving . one scene where a fbi agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button . you'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one
