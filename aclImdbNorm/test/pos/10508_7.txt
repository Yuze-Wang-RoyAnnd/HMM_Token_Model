it would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before even seeing it - as i did - but this is well worth a look. if you think about it, its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject. casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. vosloo plays it very sensitively involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that befall himself and his wife. special effects are used sparingly but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. also, after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down. the supporting characters were unnecessarily weak (the alien hunter) or menacing (the psychiatrist) which also served to detract.<br /><br />but all in all it raised some interesting issues amongst which was a telling line "how do think animals feel when we experiment on them".<br /><br />the concept of "lost time" was also thought provoking.
