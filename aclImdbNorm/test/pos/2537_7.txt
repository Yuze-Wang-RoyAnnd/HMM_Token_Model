this is no walk in the park. i saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. you will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. i felt like i'd been severely beaten. what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? this is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. and i would hesitate to say that i-me-we are not responsible for this. babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded. how can we be cruel, or self-indulgent, or neglectful of our children, when we see the graphic results of such behavior? he is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society. and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. i am not a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.
