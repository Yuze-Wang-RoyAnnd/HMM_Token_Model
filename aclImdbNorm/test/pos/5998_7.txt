at first i didn't like they way the director was constantly switching from the past (gulliver's travels) to the present (gulliver in the insane asylum). but it really is the best way to film the story even though it took some getting used to. danson is outstanding as the title character and edward fox makes a wonderful villain. worst part is mary steenburgen as gulliver's wife. she never has been hollywood gorgeous and in this film they make her look downright dowdy for some reason. i'll never understand why directors make a woman ugly when it adds nothing to the story! plus you want to strangle her for being so damn stupid in believing the lies bad guy bates keeps telling her. even her son can see thru the bastard. still a good show and i rate it b+.
