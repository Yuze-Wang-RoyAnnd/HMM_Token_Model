after seeing a texas tale of treason, the measly correspondence efforts by cox could not even afford the massive collusion stu directed with no budget. it tells a story about dedication, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. i love it! my favorite parts are the interviews with marci (she's such a hot baby babe and she digs me but she just doesn't know it yet). the japanese clerk muffing his lines, that cracked me up. the sex scene was really cool. i am going to see if stu will come over sometime and do the box light wave thing when i'm doing it with my woman. the intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits. i know thats going to get me some chicks. i hope to see more from antstuie because i know i can expect the unexpected.
