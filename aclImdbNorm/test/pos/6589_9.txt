i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago. i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life. i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings, there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth. this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community. the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness.
