i'm sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything i want to see. my appetite keeps saying, "something like broadcast news." that's what i want. something smart and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing, and a directorial style that doesn't call attention to itself. this may well be hurt's best performance (is this or the big chill, to my mind): however eccentric, hurt is smart, and to play an unintelligent person without making sure -- wink wink -- the audience knows -- wink wink -- hey, i'm not stupid... well, that's fine acting right there. hunter is note-perfect, and albert brooks is a revelation. (and he can read and sing at the same time!) great, great work.<br /><br />
