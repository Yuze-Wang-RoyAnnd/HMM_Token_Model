this is one of my favorite films, ever. the story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. unlike the other disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 dalmations, peter pan, robin hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. this is funny, creative, and always on target. this movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. however, this is not the best animated film ever made. that title belongs to the brilliant toy story. but this is a respectable second, immediately followed by the lady and the tramp.just see it and enjoy what one of the cinema's greatest achievements. and by the by, i'm not a little kid, this is for the older audiences wanting to recapture their childhood. an absolute must!
