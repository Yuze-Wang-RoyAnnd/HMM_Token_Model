this film is more than the story of danton. it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system. it probably helped spur the solidarity movement's union activity. it is more about poland in the 20th century than the french revolution. solidarity began the end of the system. this film itself is historical by it's very existence....the rest is history.<br /><br />robspiere, aka. totalitarian leaders. danton, aka. walensa. when one watches this film, one must remember the snowball which began in poland. <br /><br />actually, it could be useful for seeing the superpower struggle within the only superpower left.
