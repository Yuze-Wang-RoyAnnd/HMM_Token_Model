i saw farewell to harry at the plaza theatre while in new york city and was quite taken. the performance of william hall jr. is tremendous. this is a movie for the classic movie goer. garrett bennett's direction reminds me of early barry levinson and robert redford's work. the movie seems to transcend the typical independent film. it has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique. i saw this with a small audience (400) who were captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last and although i wasn't out and out crying (like the lady next to me) i do have to admit i had a little watering in the eyes...<br /><br />
