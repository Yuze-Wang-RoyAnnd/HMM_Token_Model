others have harped here about james stewart's age when playing lindburg (he was 47 linburg was twenty five.) but stewart does not look his age and the film, for him was a dream come true. an actual pilot and a retired air force reserve general at the end of his life, stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion, which other actors could not bring to the role. added to the cast was co-star murray hamilton, who was also to be featured in "the f.b.i. story with stewart) and such other well known character actors as richard deacon, of the later "dick van dike show" and robert cornthwaite of "the thing from another world" the 1951 sci-fi classic.<br /><br />billy wilder captures the flavor of the lindburg autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of aviation. this story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream. a box office failure at the time of it's release, it has since become one of the great classics of american film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called america's everyman. no student of film history should miss seeing this one. there have been over 500,000 films since the beginning of motion pictures, and this one belongs among the top 500.
