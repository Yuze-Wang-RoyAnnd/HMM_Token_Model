"challenge to be free" was one of the first films i saw as a child. it was also one of the first vhs tapes that i owned. i hadn't seen the movie in years, so yesterday i decided to stick the tape in and watch it. wow. the story is as powerful now as it was the first time i saw it. i think now that i am older i can better apreciate the values that are implanted in the movie. (self-reliance, the value of freedom, and the love of nature) it is a "b" movie, to be sure, but it's one that you'll remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.
