i liked this comedy so much. will smith does not do anything slow. it is always right on target with the greatest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing, and involved in the plot. you are watching a skilled comedian, who plays all his parts well. one fully believes he is who he is playing. i loved him and tommy lee jones in the men in black. this comedy rates right up with that movie. the humor is fast moving, and will smith is as sure of himself as he was in men in black. quick witted, and well skilled in the art of making others score each time, but doing it in a tasteful manner, and with finesse.<br /><br />will smith seems to have honed his comedy routine well. he was so darn funny. i loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled up, and he looked more like cassius clay after a fight then he did himself. then seeing him sipping on the benadryl bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size. i laughed so hard. he knows how to make us all laugh.
