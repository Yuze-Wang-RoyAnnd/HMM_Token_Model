i can't say i enjoyed this as much as "the big lebowski" or "raising arizona," and felt a little slighted, but "o brother" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens' brisk, twisted sense of creativity. the dvd edition contains the featurette, and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques. that surprised me! of course, this movie is not the best example (and i'm only saying this in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. <br /><br />though i enjoyed the coens' previous work, i've never been a fan of old westerns or "the dukes of hazzard" or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn. i guess that's why i didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around southern folk. for all those from the south who are reading this, i don't mean to offend any of your people! i'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like "a bronx tale." when you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature. but all apologies aside, i found the characters fun and quirky. i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing. tim blake nelson was also good. of course, george clooney--who i assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for "the perfect storm"--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent. his performance was good, though. you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter (in a short but sweet role) and john goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).<br /><br />though i don't normally dig country music, i liked the title song "a man of constant sorrow." the dvd also contains the music video for that song. <br /><br />overall, i found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn't have that in-your-face quality that the coens have shown to us in the past. it's a slighter effort, but a good one. i still suggest you check it out. <br /><br />my score: 7 (out of 10)
