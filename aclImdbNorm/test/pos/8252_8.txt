i remember seeing this film in the mid 80's thought it a well paced and well acted piece. i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed, although my office is newish it just 30 seconds away from "the bank". even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls royces.<br /><br />it's look like the dvd is due a region 2 release soon. the region 1 copy i is very poor quality. let's hope they've cleaned it up.<br /><br />only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with.
