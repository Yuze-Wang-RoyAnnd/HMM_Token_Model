lush cinematography, beautifully written and edited, john boorman's beyond rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. it interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me, popping up in my mind's eye with frequency. the story line is gripping, and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically, and in the story line. i've watched this film at least six times, and it really holds up to scrutiny. it is particularly relevant today, given world events. check it out, you won't regret it! btw, netflix does not yet carry it, but you can request that they do.
