i love this movie! it has everything! bonnie hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. david duchovny is just plain hot. and minnie driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with david allen grier, carol o'connor, robert loggia, joley richardson, and jim belushi you have a oscar worthy movie! i'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the dvd, watch it once then put directors commentary on...bonnie hunt is fabulous!
