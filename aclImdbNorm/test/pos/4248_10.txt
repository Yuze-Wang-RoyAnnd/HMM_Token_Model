i have to admit i had never heard of this movie. i caught it last night on tmc. i thought it was hysterical. i laughed so hard and loved the ending. image what a marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with salvadore dali and malcolmn x and then all dropped lsd.<br /><br />funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 iq points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. i had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. i over slept and missed my obligations. still worth it. i would not recommend renting it, i would recommend owning it. it was that good.<br /><br />the only warning i have is that so of the references are dated and might not be gotten by younger people. bare with it and use your head.<br /><br />i would have to put it in my top comedies of all time.
