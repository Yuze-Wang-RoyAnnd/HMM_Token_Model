lcdr tom dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: maverick does not mean "tom cruise". maverick means "non-conformist".), is actually an intelligence operative for the vice admiral of his submarine fleet. the vice-admiral is concerned about our old friends the russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. countries like lybia, north korea or iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into norfolk harbour or mayport, florida. and this was 6-7 years before 9/11.<br /><br />the admiral assigns dodge to assume command of a moth-balled wwii diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the uss orlando, a top of the line fast attack sub. dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears.. err i mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors. despite having "welcome aboard" tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and fair commander, he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner. the us navy could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under-appreciated gem from the creator of "police academy".
