the greatest tragedy man faces is that, capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.from this fact does so much great tragedy emerge. death in venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head-on.it confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms-self denial and decay. undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. its austerely refined look, echoey sound, mixture of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy: as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director. the central performance, at once rigid, aroused, and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence highlights bogarde as if not the best british actor of his generation then certainly the most adventurous. able to hold on to sympathy as his desires take him over and interesting despite the endless close-ups and mahler score playing above him not one for a friday night with your girlfriend but certainly ok if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation.
