this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films, it cannot be marked as very original either: the music, though subtly brilliant, sounds very much like that of american beauty. <br /><br />the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular (as well as sigourney weaver). without intent perhaps, the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much. at times, the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger, more successful "brothers" by having too much going on, or by not delivering the most effective dialogs. here, the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty. but that can be said about most movies ever made, even the best and there is still a lot to like: said music score and (expectable, given the cast) effective performances. of note is emile hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding "into the wild".<br /><br />overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must-sees, which would be topped by: 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little children.<br /><br />after you've seen and liked those, check out this one.
