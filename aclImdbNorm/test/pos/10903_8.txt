in & out, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. i thought that cameron (matt dillon) was wrong to say that howard (kevin kline) was gay. the part i liked most was howard's bachelor party. this was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things, including barbra streisand films. i also thought that emily (joan cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that howard looked good in his tuxedo. my favorite quote of in & out is, "is everybody gay? is this 'the twilight zone'?" that was absolutely hilarious! the one character i couldn't stand was sonya (shalom harlow). this was because she was very conceited and snobby. in conclusion, i recommend this movie to all you kevin kline fans who have not seen it. be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it.
