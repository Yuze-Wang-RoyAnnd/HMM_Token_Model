watching the last 2 episodes i remembered a tv add from my childhood. it showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small saloon, a man enters the bar/saloon, he is thirsty as hell, lips cracked etc...., he has just walked through the nevada desert and hasn't drunk water for days. he croaks to the bartender "gimme a packet of potato chips" while he is eating it we can feel how thirstier he is getting, we hear a voice in the background saying.... "keep building that thirst, build it till you cant hold it any more............. then blow it away with team" the man drinks team (a soft drink) it feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips the thirst is so intense that i cannot hold it any more, season 2 has even more twists and turns then season 1. the ending answers a lot of questions but asks many many more questions hopefully we will know the answer in season 3, but i doubt it because i feel lost has the momentum go a lot further then 3 seasons, if the people behind the camera keep up their good work.<br /><br />i for one will keep watching.<br /><br />from pakistan with love
