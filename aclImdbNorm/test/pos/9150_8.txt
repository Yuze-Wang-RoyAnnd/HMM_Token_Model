francois villon was a real-life poet and rogue who lived in paris in the 15th century. however, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction--from a play created at the beginning of the 20th century. whereas in the film he met and became friends with louis xi, in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues like he was in this film. in reality, he wrote some lovely verse and was frequently on the wrong side of the law--not the combination of a patriot and robin hood-like character like he is in the film. provided you know that the film is nearly 100% fiction, then it's well worth seeing--just don't assume it's a good history lesson.<br /><br />in the beloved rogue, villon is played with wild abandon by john barrymore. i was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. angelo rossitto, who was the plucky dwarf, played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career. slim summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films. mack swain is best known as the silent film foil in many of chaplin's short films and played his partner in the gold rush. all four of these men did a nice job and have no complaints---even with barrymore's rather over-the-top treatment that was rather reminiscent of a douglas fairbanks performance. however, the performance i had a serious problem with was conrad veidt as king louis xi. to call this "unsubtle" would be a gross understatement. he played the role like a high schooler who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical richard iii--skulking about and acting like a demoniacal caricature. while veidt was wonderful in many, many films (both silent and sound) but here he is just ridiculous.<br /><br />as for the story, it's full of lusty adventure and action--like a swashbuckling film minus the sailing ships. the sets worked out well for all this, as they'd been used the previous year for the hunchback of notre dame. both films were set around the same time period.<br /><br />overall, it's one of the last great silent films. there's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance, comedy and action. well worth seeing, though it loses a couple of points for veidt's overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history.<br /><br />by the way, this film was also made twice as if i were king (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original play. however, in total, six films have been about villon and tell, more or less, variations on the same tale!
