if they gave out awards for the most depraved and messed-up movies in the world, japanese cinema would clean up: their exploitation cinema wipes the floor with most other contenders, the most extreme examples being absolutely jaw-dropping exercises in bad taste, nauseating gore, freakish weirdness, and misogynistic sex.<br /><br />guts of a beauty is a prime example of such whacked out filth, offering discerning viewers just over an hour of full-on debauchery and gratuitous violence topped off with some very insane j-splatter goodness.<br /><br />the film opens with a young woman named yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty yakuza, who proceed to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called angel rain. after the gangsters have finished having their fun with the poor woman, she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist hiromi (megumi ozawa) attempts to help. however, the distraught and confused yoshimi ends up throwing herself off the hospital roof, turning into a water melon as she hits the ground (at least that what it looked like to me!).<br /><br />seeking to avenge yoshimi's death, hiromi lures higashi, a member of the yakuza, to her office, and, whilst jacking him off, hypnotises him into attacking his fellow gang members. after higashi goes slash happy with a knife in the yakuza hq, he is severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell of his meeting with hiromi, and then hacked into itty bitty pieces.<br /><br />the psychologist is then captured by the gang, subjected to a spot of forced buggery (whilst simultaneously being forced to give head to a yakuza slut), and injected with angel rain
