there is more to this movie than meets the eye. if you're looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy, you'll be disappointed. but for an entertaining 90 minutes, this is just fine.<br /><br />the cinematography is careful and precise. the sex scenes, which one comment decries as gratuitous, are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters.<br /><br />yes, some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings. but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light, without being sensationalistic (at least not for early 21st century urban standards). and there are many very amusing moments.
