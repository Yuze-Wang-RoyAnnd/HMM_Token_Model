that's right, we've got a 2008 film using themes of "brief encounter," and "the bridges of madison county." it's basically the story of lost loves, redemption and a triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />the performances by richard gere and especially diane lane are very good. gere gives the kind of restrained performance here as a doctor who is searching for meaning, after a patient dies on the operating table. lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a nice young son, who has split from her wandering husband and has also sustained the loss of her father in the same year.<br /><br />scott glenn steals the show in a one scene meeting with gere. he is the heartbroken husband and he recounts his love to his departed wife, it will bring tears to your eyes.<br /><br />fresh from her triumph as an acquiescing mother in "doubt," viola davis appears as an understanding friend in the film and literally hangs her hair down in a rather benign performance.
