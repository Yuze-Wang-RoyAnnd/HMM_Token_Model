flipping through the channels i was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie. i must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately. i love older films and this is or should be considered a classic! one of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl. i highly recommend this movie!
