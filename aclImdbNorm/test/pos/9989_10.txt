i thought that this movie was incredible. i absolutely loved it, even though my brothers didn't that much. the special effects were outstanding, and this movie is about my favorite sport; golf. the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row. this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen. it was everything i would expect out of a movie. i just loved it. also, it was pretty kid-friendly. this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it, anything is possible. i would give it a pure 10/10! it was better than the legend of baggar vants, and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined. absolutely amazing. loved it.
