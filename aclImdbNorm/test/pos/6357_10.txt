first, i must say that i don't speak spanish and usually do not enjoy spanish speaking films... but two coyotes is an exceptional film. there is enough action and hard drama that it doesn't matter that its a spanish speaking film. the subtitles were easy to read and didn't block the action - or the drama!<br /><br />i would tell fans of spanish speaking films and non-fans of spanish speaking films to go see this movie. the action and drama are worth every penny.<br /><br />
