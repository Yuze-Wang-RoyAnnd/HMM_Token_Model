this review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box. so if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it, except that i like it a lot, stop here...<br /><br />the production values are not first rate, but the acting between the leads is, and they give the romance between them more life than shute does in his novel (although i generally prefer the novel). my very faint objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film dumbs-down some of the relationships with secondary characters, and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film, to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device. all this is handled much better in the book, with the result that i find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie.
