totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor. i loved it!!! it is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film, except for nicolas read, who plays an un-dead court jester, to comic brilliance. but being that as it may, i laughed so many times and i have to hand it to the film makers, it wasn't pretentious or ordinary in any way. raping, fighting, zombies vomitting on their rape victims. what other movie has this? not for the quesy, but with a pizza, a bong, and a six pack of beer, you got it made, if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself.
