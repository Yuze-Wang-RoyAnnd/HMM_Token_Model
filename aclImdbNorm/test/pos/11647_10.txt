dead man walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears by the end! you can not watch this film and not think about the issues it raises; how can you justify killing (whether it be murder or the death penalty) and to what point is forgiveness possible (not just in a spiritual way). don't watch this film when your down! but watch it!!!
