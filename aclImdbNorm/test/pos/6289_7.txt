this is the only pauly shore movie you should ever see. o.k., it's the only one i've ever seen, and i think i've made good choices. i normally find shore's shtick kind of tired, but he is very funny in this movie. actually, the script is pretty funny, and shore doesn't overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? tomfoolery? anyway, this is a funny, if ultimately forgettable film. --frink-3
