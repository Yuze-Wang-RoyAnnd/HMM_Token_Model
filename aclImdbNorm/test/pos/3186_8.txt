this is a great tv movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast.<br /><br />the only problem this movie has is that it hasn't stood the test of time as well as it might have.<br /><br />despite this, it's definitely worth viewing, particularly if you are an alan alda or ruth gordon fan.
