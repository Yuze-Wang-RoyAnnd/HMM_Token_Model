in the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. the result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. the narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.<br /><br />our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama. although the stuff of hollywood lurks in the details, doug block treats the story as he would everyday life. for those of us who have always speculated about our parents' life before we came on the scene (or after we arrived, but while we were too self- absorbed to notice they had a life independent of ourselves), 51 birch street gives fair warning: there are wondrous things back there in fatherland, but beware if you choose to enter there.<br /><br />but that caution is for the audience to go slow wandering about in the details of their parents' past. it is not a warning for those offered a glimpse into the life of block's parents. the film is a marvel at making the mother come alive as a vibrant and passionate yet introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions during the 50's. the filmmaker's particular success is to make the viewers actually see the young woman behind the elderly parent and grandparent. we all know our parents were once young and vigorous, but in 51 birch street, the mother is. the father who has been distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing up ultimately remains distant in the film, but that is due more to his own elusive nature than to his portrayal. this biography turned autobiography is dramatic, intense, and unforgettable, sure to send viewers scurrying for a closer look at their own family albums but more hesitant about looking at the backs of those photographs.
