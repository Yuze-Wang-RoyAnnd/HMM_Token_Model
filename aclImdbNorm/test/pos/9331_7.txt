music videos are often completely disregarded in any discussion about film, with most people considering them to be a lesser art form. while a great majority are merely flashy clips to advertise a popular performer's latest hit single, a precious few really do rise above the rest, becoming works of art in their own right {anything directed by spike jonze or michel gondry is always worth watching}. while "art" isn't precisely the word i'd use to describe michael jackson's 'thriller (1983),' it is an intensely-likable hybrid of schlock horror and music, and an outrageously-campy short film that remains remarkably endearing nearly 25 years later. the thirteen-minute music video, both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release, was directed by john landis, a filmmaker i'm not terribly familiar with, though 'the blues brothers (1980)' is a classic, and i hear that 'an american werewolf in london (1981)' is a stupendously entertaining horror/comedy.<br /><br />whether or not 'thriller' actually qualifies as a music video is certainly up for debate, taking into account its extensive length {though jackson bettered this effort with 1997's 'ghosts,' at 38 minutes} and the fact that the title song comprises less than half of the total running time. the video opens with a brief film-within-a-film, as michael, on a quiet and brightly-lit night, reveals to his girlfriend (ola ray) that he is "different" from other guys, transforming into a hideous werewolf as the nighttime clouds part to reveal a full moon. as he presumably decapitates the unfortunate heroine, we come across michael and his girl in the movie theatre, actually watching this drama unfold in a horror picture. when the girl becomes frightened, they both leave cinema and begin to walk home, at which point michael begins to sing the opening lines of his latest song, "thriller." however, when a hoard of blood-thirsty zombies emerge from the local graveyard {their entrance ghoulishly narrated by vincent price}, the situation begins to get interesting.<br /><br />it's difficult to quite put my finger on why 'thriller' is considered one of the greatest of all music videos. it can't simply be that the song itself is a lot of fun, and michael jackson
