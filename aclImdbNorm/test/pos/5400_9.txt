before barton jumps all over my remarks, let's all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses, we all have them.....<br /><br />i loved sigourney weaver & jeff daniels, i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime. downplayed just perfectly and understated. unlike some others, i did not find this @ all predictable.<br /><br />i found sigourney's role refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer.<br /><br />i found it enjoyable and wasn't anticipating recommending this to all and sundry. this is why there are different flavors of ice cream, something to please everyone...
