this film is so different to anything you would have seen before. it's an honest and chilling account of an entire family's battle with a terminal illness. <br /><br />'the closer she gets' is shot in a very unique style. craig oulette films in a very different way.... using different angles and viewpoints, in what i find is a very eye catching manner (perhaps due to his experience with photographic works). <br /><br />his style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing, but what loved ones close to her also have to deal with. <br /><br />a very sad, but extremely interesting and unique film. one i would definitely suggest watching.
