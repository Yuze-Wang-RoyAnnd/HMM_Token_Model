mr baseball was a fun video rental with my fianc'e susan nauss. susan said that she had been looking forward to seeing the movie. ken takakura oda as a tough yet honorable manager makes sense. ken takakura has made so many wonderful asian movies, i correct the one reviewer and say takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like hotari. of course everyone likes tom selleck yet ken takakura is the better dramatic actor of the two. today someone accused me of being yakuza, well i say that my great uncle shadow president jack f kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our cocreators humans are free people fighting all the parts of adversity that president kennedy talked about in his inaugural address. to be honest someone has kept food prices very low in canada on things like bread. in honor of our cocreators please stop eating amphibians reptiles and eggs. i hope that there will one day be a sequel to mr baseball with father ken takakura oda still as manager. thank you to imdb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind president george w bush and i support. support imdb.
