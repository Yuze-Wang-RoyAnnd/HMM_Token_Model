a labor of love. each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. the director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. i have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. the remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me. the casting is as perfect as one can get. vijay raaz, camille and benoit each hold their own. <br /><br />i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good cinema. i can't wait for the commercial release of this movie.
