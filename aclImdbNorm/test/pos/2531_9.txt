this was really a "nightmare" of a film; i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and haven't forgotten it since. pixote is a 10-year old boy who lives in the streets of sao paulo (brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends lilica, dito and chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day...in the first half of the film pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids; one night, lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. the rest of the film shows pixote's descent into a criminal life; he doesn't show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives...but there is, however, a gentle scene in the middle of the film; pixote and his friends are at the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the reformatory was there. i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events...the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend, but for a better life. director hector babenco's "pixote" is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the harshest reality many people -including myself- tend to ignore or misunderstand. this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.
