lifeforce is certainly one of tobe hooper's best films. it has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a typical horror fan's dream. the film is quit creative though and i think that's because of the script from dan o'bannon and don jakoby. nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film.
