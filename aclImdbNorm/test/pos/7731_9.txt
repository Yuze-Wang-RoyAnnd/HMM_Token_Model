an extremely gentle retelling of the shakespeare play (and much more overt about it than forbidden planet). cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with gena rowlands sharing the spotlight. his take on the prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all-knowing expression he brings to the story. this especially comes to the forefront in a scene when, upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, he conjures up a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from stomu yamashta's "go"). this is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe. add to this an excellent performance by raul julia, plus good work by susan sarandon, vittorio gassman and molly ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.
