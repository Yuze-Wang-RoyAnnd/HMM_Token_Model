although the premise of the movie involves a major "coincidence," the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life. i found myself rooting for the characters played by mary tyler moore and christine lahti, empathizing with both, and wanting them to reconcile. sam waterston and ted danson are fine in their roles as well, doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. while the story tends to leap through time, occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. this interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "chick flick."
