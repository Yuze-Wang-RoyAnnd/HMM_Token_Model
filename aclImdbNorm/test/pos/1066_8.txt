forget jimmy stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. i suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and stanwyck's other great christmas story, "meet john doe" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.<br /><br />stanwyck plays a food writer for a mccall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. she's an ace b.s. artist until the day morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a navy hospital. released the last year of wwii, the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality. stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky morgan with whom it's love at first sight. unfortunately, she has to play married to gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in ct, just to fool her boss.<br /><br />s.z. sakall adds a great deal of hungarian malaprop & double-entendre humor in support as babs' true source of culinary talent & una o'connor is hilarious as gardiner's obnoxious irish housekeeper.
