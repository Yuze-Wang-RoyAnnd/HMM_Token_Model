yes, it's "flipper". but writer/director alan shapiro has put together a gem of a version. spectacular above and underwater photography from "jaws" veteran bill butler and haunting music by joel mcneely and crosby, stills & nash make this truly memorable family entertainment. shapiro, whose last film was improbably "the crush", shows himself once again to be an extremely talented -- and versatile -- filmmaker. rent it!
