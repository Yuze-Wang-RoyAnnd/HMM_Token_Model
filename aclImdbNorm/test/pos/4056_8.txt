i first saw "signs of life" on pbs as an american playhouse presentation. it's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent d'onofrio as his brother, daryl. arthur kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges, kathy bates and mary-louise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.<br /><br />the direction is subtle and effective. i've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it. a beautiful piece of filmmaking.
