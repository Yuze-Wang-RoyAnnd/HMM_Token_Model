incredibly hilarious mid-70's italian rootsploitation with lots of non-consensual s&m, lesbian sex, gratuitous racial cruelty etc...few redeeming cinematic qualities, except for the fairly cool theme music with dubby "african" drums and flute. brilliant sample dialog: <br /><br />white slave owner (to white plantation manager): "you're so dumb, i'll bet you forgot to interrogate that n****r midwife!"<br /><br />white plantation manager: "not only did i interrogate her, i did it so well she died before i could get any answers from her!"<br /><br />all the black actors have 70's afros, and say "yes, massa" in a high-pitched voice. the female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation. 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze.
