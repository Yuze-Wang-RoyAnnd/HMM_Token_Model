i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. i taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on channel four but my tape is severely worn now and i would love a new copy of it.i have e-mailed film four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as i know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. i have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. the performances are superb. the film has everything. its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days. it is extremely well paced and grips you from start to end. the scene in the shower room is particularly horrific. i also cannot hear the song badge by cream and not think of this film. this film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is superb. channel four please show again or release on video or dvd.
