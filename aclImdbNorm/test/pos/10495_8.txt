this was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor martin sheen really is. he modestly claims that charlie is a better actor, charlie can't hold a candle to him.<br /><br />i found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwining of the love story with the main plot (and i usually hate love stories). there's a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible, particularly in the early 80's time period, and probably now also.<br /><br />the final scene had me on the edge of my seat. this film roundly illustrates that treachery is often doled out by those we trust, while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and finally, that human compassion can be found where we least expect it.<br /><br />irenerose
