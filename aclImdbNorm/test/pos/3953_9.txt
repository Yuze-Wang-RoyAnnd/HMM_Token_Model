james franco is totally cool in this movie. not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. at the tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole james dean thing but i don't think this true. blind spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. in this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. it's a unique performance. bittersweet and really moving. the lines from his journal cut you like a knife. you sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. the tone is everything. he carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor. i like the other two actors a great deal too. the blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism. some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini-point really. the film is totally solid and franco is way cool all around.
