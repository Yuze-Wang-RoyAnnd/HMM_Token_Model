i know one is not supposed to comment on other users' comments, but i will say that a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew quite a lot about the manhattan project and were annoyed at things that were left out. (from his book 'smoking in bed' it appears the original screenwriter bruce robinson is another such.) i knew very little before watching the film, however, and found it rivetting. dwight schultz is absolutely mesmeric as oppenheimer - a truly magnetic, charismatic presence, an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he isn't given better roles and more leading parts. john cusack and paul newman are excellent as always. one could quibble with various script or direction choices, but as it is the film is extremely intense and horrific at times and overall i give it four stars out of five.
