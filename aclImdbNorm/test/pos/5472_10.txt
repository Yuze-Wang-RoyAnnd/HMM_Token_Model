to those of you who've made comments on this film earlier and hoped to see it again, i hope you did. it was broadcast today (nov. 28th,'04) on lifetime movie network. i subscribe to dish.<br /><br />karen arthur directed william petersen and barbara hershey in this southwestern gothic-like tale, expertly. the lighting, editing and dialog contributed greatly to the film and hershey and peterson were perfectly cast for the roles, both playing sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. the screen play was excellent, as well the supporting cast.<br /><br />not having known ahead-of-time, i guessed correctly the story was based on truth, and now that i know it i must make the sojourn, as santa fe is a hop, skip and a jump from tucson.<br /><br />as an engineer, i was fascinated with the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it (who was he? an angel?). but the storyline, and it's several plots, of how it came to be is what most captivates you. you certainly get a strong sense that god in his heaven was in every detail of this entire drama in history. for you who have seen the film, you know what i'm talking about. for those of you who haven't, i won't spoil a minute of it...<br /><br />bon holiday,<br /><br />bob shank jr, raytheon missile systems, tucson, az
