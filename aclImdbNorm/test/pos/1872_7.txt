i am a firm believer that a film, tv serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor- as to when written, produced or conceived-should be taken in to account.<br /><br />yeh jo hai zindagi is one such series. i remember watching it in the mid-80's on tv and the re-runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90's. and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. that made me buy the full series dvd set and surprise of surprises- the comedy and the moments of the good 'ol days simply fell flat for me. even the very popular "30 years ka experience" "gulaaaab jamun!" and "sofa cum bed" did not invoke the kind of mirth i thought it would. the timing factor: for the 80's, this was the showstopper. the main event. the mother of all tv comedies. and it worked during the age and time! perhaps the same cannot be said right now, but nonetheless, watching the dvd did bring back pleasant memories.<br /><br />i wish the seasons with shafi inamdar and swarup sampat were longer. satish shah has been un-believably good as the heart of the show, with equally effective support cast of farida jalal, tiku talsania and the bengali neighbours. rakesh bedi hams throughout.<br /><br />all in all, an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during the prime times, might not appeal to the younger viewers or first time watchers!
