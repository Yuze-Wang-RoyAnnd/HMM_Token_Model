this is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction. after the movie, ramin bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script.<br /><br />bahrani's camera is silent, he is not judgmental, he almost erases director from the movie by purpose, background is not organized to make the picture pretty, however don't get me wrong; there is a lot of preparation for this movie. starting on personal level, being the part of environment, being to be ignored when you film.<br /><br />main character is a 'real' actor in every sense.<br /><br />i would like to thank all crew for this movie, showing us another country within nyc. i strongly suggest it if you like stories of others.<br /><br />bora kizilirmak
