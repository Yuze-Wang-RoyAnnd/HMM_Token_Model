considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. one could make a case that in shoulder arms, charlie chaplin invented the genre.<br /><br />hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. when you consider that some of the best films involving such people as bob hope, abbott&costello, laurel&hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.<br /><br />in the first world war chaplin along with fellow stars douglas fairbanks and mary pickford went out on bond tours. he was a great supporter of the allied cause, unusual for someone of his left wing views. it would seem only natural that the tramp would be drafted and unfortunately would flummox around and wreak havoc on all.<br /><br />a lot of things you'd see in the service comedies of world war ii got their start in shoulder arms. chaplin had no more imitators because within a few weeks of the film's release, the war was over.<br /><br />but a comedy art form had been established by one of comedy's greatest geniuses.
