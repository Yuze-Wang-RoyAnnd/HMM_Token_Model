i was expecting this movie to be a stinker but i wanted to see for myself, but i was surprised how good of a movie this was. i know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me. it maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times. the plot was good and the morality play was a good one. i liked the realism which was along the lines of "unforgiven". i had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it.
