i loved the film "eddie monroe". the film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. i especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. craig morris has brad pitt potential both in looks and talent. his blue eyes reminded me of paul newman's. fred carpenter took this movie to a new level.i loved the cast. the music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. i loved seeing some of my favorite actors in eddie monroe. fred carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director. he gives his work 200%. the film has great texture. i hope that there will be an eddie monroe 2. i would love to see how nicolette turns out after getting her windfall of money. fred carpenter's eddie monroe is hollywood level.
