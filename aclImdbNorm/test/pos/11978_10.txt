all the people who voted a meager 1 on this movie, this is all i have to say: you guys have not matured enough to enjoy cinema of this kind. it takes a certain amount of dedication to reach that level of appreciation. and that is the segment of people this movie was aimed at. not you average movie-goers by any chance! . back to the movie. this one was a gem all right and definitely an inclusion in the bollywood hall of fame. i'd give it an all time rank of no # 2, surpassed only by kanti shah's legendary gunda. this movie had an impeccable story line and created a beautiful blend between a fantasy and sci-fi. pan's labyrinth would have in fact been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories. and now do i really need to mention the stellar cast and even stellar-er (that is a word from now) performances from them (a special mention goes to mr. nigam for the best debut ever in any movie on this earth). every actor in this movie had been very carefully chosen and the role were tailor made for them (and for their age too, i must add). manisha koirala still looks like she's 18 and wow man, with that figure i would have raped her too. are you wondering where did this rape thing come in suddenly? yes, a rape is what the premises of this movie is based on. and that is so not like your average bollywood type movies. if you are an atheist or an agnostic by any chance, this movie is again a must for you. because this movie can heal your faith. i don't think it'd even be going too far saying that this movie can cure cancer. only the people who need it the most fail to appreciate its power, charm and undying beauty. tchch, so unfortunate!<br /><br />only flaw in this movie: in your dreams, baby! this was flawless.<br /><br />only minor complain: the director failed to star mithun da as well. <br /><br />i won't ruin it for you any further. just go and watch it. today. and if you like it, here are some more recommendation from me. gunda, desh drohi, aparichit, the old ramsay brothers horror movies, loha, indra the tiger and sivaji.
