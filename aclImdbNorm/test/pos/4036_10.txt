i thought that the storyline came into place very well. i liked this movie a lot. if you're going to rag on a bridget fonda movie, you can just rot. i thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. apparently somebody doesn't think so. i rather enjoyed the movie. i'm even thinking of buying it. i want it to be my very first dvd for my room. that's how much i like it. i rather would not start an online argument with someone i don't know & have it be over a movie. if someone could kindly retract what they said about the storyline, i would be more than happy to retract my insult. however, if they feel that i am not worthy of a retraction, i might just feel that they are not worthy of one either. but i can't control their actions, i can only encourage them in the right direction. hey, they don't have to make a retraction, but i would greatly appreciate it.
