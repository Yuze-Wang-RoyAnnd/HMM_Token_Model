i am so impressed, really. i expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else.<br /><br />ok, there's a ton of pretty geeky humor. but the movie is so well done. the acting is quite good.<br /><br />the dialog, while gamer cheesy at times, i guess to cater to the gamer crowd, is not bad at all. at times it's even, dare i say, great.<br /><br />when the female gamer, who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual (min/max) type gets all these additional attacks (seem right, i did not check the rules,) it was cool.<br /><br />the sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie.<br /><br />the story moves right along. the transitions from game world to real world are well done. a male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female, and sometimes by himself. pretty clever, i thought.<br /><br />the guy who decided to play a female, but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs. he even said tag at one point, and the female walked on to play the role ( sorry, i did not look her name up, she did great though.) the guy always trying to "get some", got a bit tedious, but i guess that was more gamer humor.<br /><br />there was just so much to like about the movie. lighthearted. fun! very well done and i am saying that as a movie fan, not a gamer (and i am not a d&d player.) as i said i expected so much less.<br /><br />movies often don't hold my attention, i end up listening to them while working on my computer. this one held my attention. i can't give a movie much higher praise.
