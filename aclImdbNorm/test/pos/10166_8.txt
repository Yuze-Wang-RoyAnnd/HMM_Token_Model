"the man who knew too much" (1955) is alfred hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (james stewart and doris day) on vacation in morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder, espionage, assassinations and the worst of all, kidnapping of their 10-years-old son. the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun. stewart and day have a good chemistry together. the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense. <br /><br />the inclusion of "que sera, sera" proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like "que sera, sera" did in "the man who knew too much". <br /><br />hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin "storm cloud cantata" for almost ten minutes while scene in london's royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both, the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous.
