nightbreed blew my mind the first time i saw it. and it's held up quite well over the years. the sets and monster effects work, are some of the best i've ever seen. nobody i know seems to have seen this film, which i believe tanked at the box office, because of the lack of interest in horror, in the early nineties. it plays like a dark, horrific fairy tale, and is a lot deeper, then you'd think, with a strong message against bigotry, presented by a rich mystical past, that clive barker created. what sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note, that we'll probably never see. my only minor gripe is that craig sheffer is only a passable actor at best, and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part. just a minor complaint though as sheffer does alright. i had a similar issue with scott bakula in barker's lord of illusions, not really a terrible performance, but i just didn't like him in the role as much as i would have other people.
