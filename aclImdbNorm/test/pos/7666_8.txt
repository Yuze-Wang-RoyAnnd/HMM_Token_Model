this show was incredible, but too esoteric for most people. if you had never truly seen a european variety show in the 70's or 80's (or at least a mexican one) the entire show would probably be lost on you. if you had, this show was a dead on skewering satire of the phony spectacle and shallowness that these shows dive into at their worst. helmed by a chain-smoking suave wannabe with a pencil moustache and his ultra-glamorous and immasculating harridan of an ex-wife, "viva variety" is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always descends into in-fighting and acts gone very wrong. the hosts are joined by "johnny bluejeans", a dim witted side-kick who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him, which of course, they don't.<br /><br />the result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general. imagine the arguing that probably happened backstage during the last days of the "sonny & cher show". now imagine it's happening onstage in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure. now add cheesy acts and a euro-riche mentality (tuxedoes, gowns, booze, accents and smokes). now you have "viva variety".<br /><br />have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians? too conceptual? viva variety did this for comedians. way too esoteric for the standard american audience. it was funny as hell. and doomed.
