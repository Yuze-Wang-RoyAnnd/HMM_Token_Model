when you have waited years to see a film that you have heard on the grape vine about obviously your expectations are high right? f**k yeah!but when this baby dropped through my door little did i know what f***ed up visuals would grace my tv and warp my fragile mind. first off karim hussein is a film fan like all of us growing up on a diet of argento/fulci/lynch etc.....and it shows in this film, but in a good way. although i didn't really know what the hell was going on on my first watch of this gem i was just amazed by the visuals,the lighting and of course the performances from everyone who was involved karim must have truly believed that he was going to push the boundaries in film-making(which trust me he does)and that he was going to have a hard job convincing the actors to do the same........<br /><br />so what can i tell you about "subconscious cruelty"?well without spoiling it....its a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness which toils into madness.....a truly unforgettable experience.......<br /><br />keep you eye on karim hussein he can only go onto better things.....<br /><br />i viewed the full uncut print of subconscious cruelty on a double disc dvd from infliction films which is loaded with extras.....please note there is a censored hong kong release out there avoid this version.
