this short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration. <br /><br />after a session at a recording studio frank sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was jewish. he lectured them as only an american icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the nazis. the meaning could not be clearer.<br /><br />both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for columbia records. if you are but a dream and the song written for the film, the house i live in. the latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of america, we'd all like to strive for.<br /><br />sinatra in fact recorded the house i live in again during the sixties for a joint album he did for his reprise record label. the album is now a rarity and it shouldn't be. his collaborators were bing crosby and fred waring and his pennsylvanians with the orchestra conducted by nelson riddle.<br /><br />axel stordahl was sinatra's primary music conductor and arranger during the forties. when he died that position eventually fell to nelson riddle. stordahl does the orchestration for the short and the columbia record, riddle for the reprise record. <br /><br />sinatra aficionados and others should listen to both back to back and compare. and catch this worthwhile film whenever it is shown.
