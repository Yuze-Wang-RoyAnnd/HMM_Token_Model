i've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good. chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act. she appears occasionally in soft core such as "body of love" and "lady chatterly's stories" on showtime. i thought nicole hilbig did ok too with her nice body and charming accent. too bad she's not in more films.
