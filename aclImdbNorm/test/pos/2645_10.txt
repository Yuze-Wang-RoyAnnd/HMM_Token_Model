this was such a great film. it was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. it was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. i loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. i loved how it was a question of "do you need me/us now"? the movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. what more could you ask for from a mere movie? perhaps a complement movie. any appreciator of 2001: a space odyssey will find the movie 2010 is 2001's complement movie. 2010 is more story orientated than 2001.
