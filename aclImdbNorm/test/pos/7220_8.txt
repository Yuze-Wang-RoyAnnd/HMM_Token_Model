i don't think the world was ready for this film. i know i wasn't. i'd been expected a standard low-budget schlock exploitation potboiler. instead, i got the most intelligent reworking of shakespeare since peter greenaway's "prospero's books". this should become the definitive film version of romeo and juliet. it won't of course. but that's the world's loss.
