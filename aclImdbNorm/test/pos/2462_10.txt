the vietnam war era is certainly far before my time, but it has always interested me, and i have seen many films about it. all of the others i'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle. when i read a description of "the war at home," i found the concept intriguing. no vietnam war movie i'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with. <br /><br />one night, while flipping through channels, the movie aired on the sundance channel. i set down the remote and settled back to watch it. i did not move from my seat during the entire two hours; it's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what is going to happen next. <br /><br />this movie made me a huge fan of emilio estevez. i had enjoyed him very much as billy the kid in the "young guns" movies, but i never saw anything he did afterward. emilio proved to be very talented at writing and directing as well as acting. <br /><br />the pacing of the movie is done extremely well. i am hard-pressed to think of a point where it drags. <br /><br />what amazes me is that it didn't get an oscar or any real recognition when it came out. it is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably will never be as they remembered him again. definitely worth seeing.
