this movie typifies the early eighties as well as fun!! i remember watching this movie on hbo when i was little, and it was my favorite movie. since it was a while ago, no one i had ever met knew what it was. then, about the time my roommate had said she had seen it too, and that it was her favorite, they started to print it again!! luckily, i have a copy now!! if anyone ever wants to see the greatest (cheesy) scavenger hunt that was probably the beginning ideas of hazing for frats, this movie is it!!! (watcher - has to have a serious love for cheesy 80's type movies!!)
