ok, so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid. however, i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid. there's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me. you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself. in this movie, hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid. you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her.<br /><br />not to say this movie is not without it's problems. unlike the first one, mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting. it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie. also, one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks. the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life, and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot-line. the villains are also a bit questionable, even though truly hateable bad guys. i also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom night.<br /><br />so maybe this isn't a perfect movie. so maybe this wouldn't be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night. however, in more ways than one, it's a guilty pleasure. hillary swank is just so loveable, and the story, even though unoriginal, works. in a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air. unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude van-damme, this is a movie about the spirit and the heart. there are some people that need movies like this, and we'll take whatever we can get. my rating: 8/10
