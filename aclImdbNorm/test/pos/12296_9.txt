no one would ever question that director leos carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius? so many people hated this film! i am normally the first person to accuse many french directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'l'enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'feux rouges'). but strangely enough, i actually think that 'pola x' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances. the film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than i believe i have ever seen on screen before. but then, carax is extreme, that we know. the film also contains what i consider way over-the-top trotskyite or anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing scott walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels. guillaume depardieu plays a rich young man in a ch^ateau (whose step-mother is catherine deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way). but he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by deneuve as an inconvenience. this is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak french coherently. depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance. he then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though i have no objection to it, as i think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in america, where apparently it never happens. the intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama. the differences between carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme french films which i think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background. many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but i don't agree. i believe carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all. it is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all i know, may be a complete madman, but i believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
