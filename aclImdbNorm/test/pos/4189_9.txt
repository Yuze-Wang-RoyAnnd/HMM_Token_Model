i can't believe this isn't a huge cult hit. perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see it. that cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since. don't make this mistake. _head_ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate. it is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).
