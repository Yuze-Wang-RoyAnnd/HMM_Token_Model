oddly enough, the independent film channel showed this film a week after it showed karate bear fighter--even though the bear film was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first!!! what were they thinking?! while all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great kyokushin karate master, you can't help but think that they must have embellished the story quite a bit--especially in this first film. sure, the guy evidently did fight and kill a bull and later a bear (in fact, he fought and killed many bulls during his career), but in this film set in the early 50s, at the end of the film, the hero actually fights about 60 guys and kills many of them brutally. i just can't imagine that this really occurred. so i did some checking and found that while many of the details are correct, some of this film is pure bunk! yes, he did kill a man in self-defense and yes he did follow the widow and her son and spent a year working for them--trying to get them to forgive him. but the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash. seeing one of his opponents get a staff thrust through his head and all the other gory details couldn't have happened or else the japanese government would have locked oyama up to protect society! the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent. there are no complaints about the action or acting. the only minor complaint is the camera work--which is a tad sloppy during some of the fight scenes. despite this minor complaint, this is a most enjoyable film. in many ways, the wandering karate master theme is pretty reminiscent of the zatoichi films--which are also lots of fun to watch but many of the exploits are truly impossible.<br /><br />fyi--there is an englished dubbed version of this film entitled "champion of death" and i just saw it as well. it's not a bad dubbing and it was letter boxed (a big plus), but still i prefer the subtitled version.
