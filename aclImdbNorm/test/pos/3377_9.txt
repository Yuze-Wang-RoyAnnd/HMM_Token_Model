i wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. it told the story more of robin williams, then mork & mindy. still, thought it was great. we got to see, robin always being 'on', no matter what. the performance of diamontopolous was awesome.<br /><br />the introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. roebuck as garry marshall was wonderful. he was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the williams energy. the little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (happy days, and laverne & shirley), was enlightening. i also thought richmond-peck's harvey was also a nice rock in the pond. (this is a good thing).<br /><br />this movie told the age old story of hollywood folks, going through the ups and downs of stardom. it kept me glued to my tv, and i learned to love robin, well hell, mostly everybody seem to be the super people i sometimes think hollywood is. go figure.<br /><br />i sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots. we never saw the head of abc. just heard him, like charlie from charlie angels (i wonder if this way planed?). it seems so sad, that a show at number 1, could be so destroy by their own network.<br /><br />i think this story could be told about anyone's life, as they climb the ladder of any job. movie, and tv stars are always loved or hated by so many people, that you grew up with, you just want to reach back in their past, to remember your own past. i remember watching the show, and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives.<br /><br />mork and mindy, will always be part of me, and i got to see part of them. it may not all be the truth, it's also all not a lie, but in the end, it told me a wonderful sad, happy story.
