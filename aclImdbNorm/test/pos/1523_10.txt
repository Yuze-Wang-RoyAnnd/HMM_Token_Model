this is the most difficult movie i have ever seen...the emotional content is horrific, yet unforgetable. a woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning. the whole movie revolves around her interrogation. alan rickman and madeline stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve oscars for their performances.
