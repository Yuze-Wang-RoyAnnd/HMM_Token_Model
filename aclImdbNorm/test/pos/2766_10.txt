susie q is a great romantic prom movie. amy jo johnson (susie q) is a great actress. i think she did a great performance. i hope that sometime that the disney company could put this movie on dvd. i think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. it's kind of sad when susie q dies in a car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. but in the middle when no one suspects susie q it gets kind of funny and surprising. there is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much. but still i would recommend this movie to the whole family if they enjoy comedy, mystery, or romance type of movies. it's great! i think that amy jo johnson as susie q is cute.
