i am very impressed by the reviews i've read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. i couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that imdb members have already done. if i may, i'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: mr baseball was american and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was not an ugly american. the original ugly american was homer atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by burdick and lederer, and the exact opposite of mr baseball. homer was an archetypal american, and an archetypal engineer - he went to vietnam to work with people, he respected and liked the people he met, he used appropriate, sustainable technology in cooperation with his hosts, and he was liked and respected by them precisely because he exemplified democratic values and american virtues. his ugliness was purely facial, merely skin-deep; his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine.<br /><br />mr baseball exemplifies all the crass, ignorant, insecure boorishness that we europeans and americans so often inflict on other cultures; homer atkins, the ugly american, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and decency. i believe that the ugly americans still far outnumber the mr baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.
