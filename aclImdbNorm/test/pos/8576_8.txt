i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.<br /><br />the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching. the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is.<br /><br />although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation; if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place, the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable.<br /><br />luckily, optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand.<br /><br />i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see. i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it.
