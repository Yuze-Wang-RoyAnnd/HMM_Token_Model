so after years and years i finally track this film down! i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft, just staring out with a pale white face. this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, i remember chills running down my spine. watching it now, its obviously nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. if anyone wants a copy, private message me.<br /><br />the story itself is fairly standard bcff stuff. its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around - there is no real moral as such (except that 'ghosts are here to help us?' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') there wasn't even a greed/capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. however, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. the captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. oh well.
