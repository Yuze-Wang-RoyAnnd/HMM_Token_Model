the title of my summary pretty much covers my review. <br /><br />this is to me what teenage mutant ninja turtles was to someone 5 years older. while i missed out on that little pop-culture wave, i embraced the toy line and t.v. series that was mighty max with both arms.<br /><br />you wanna know how into this i was? i went as mighty max for halloween.<br /><br />thank god for the internet. thanks to demonoid, last week i was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade.<br /><br />i'm watching this right now, having just been blown away by recognizing rob paulson of animaniacs, and am also loving the celebrity humor in "tar wars". 4 minutes in, and they have already mentioned, by name: clint eastwood, governor arnold, dustin hoffman, john wayne, and ace ventura. hells yeah. <br /><br />damn, it is only upon writing this that i realize there is no way in hell i can give this series anything less than a perfect score. any imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. <br /><br />this is my childhood. this is awesomeness. this is the mighty one.
