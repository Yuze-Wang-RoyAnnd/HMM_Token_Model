the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. errol flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him. olivia dehavilland was never more beautiful. arthur kennedy never more villainous. anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse. it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. the one historical aspect i found most glaringly inaccurate was the final "last stand" which occurred on the banks of the little big horn. the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. however, i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywood's golden age.
