this film biography of early rock and roll star buddy holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for gary busey. the movie's highlights are busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings holly songs. he brings such energy to the performances that holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.<br /><br />the film follows holly's career from growing up in lubbock, texas, to stardom and new york and his untimely death in a plane crash. one thing i found interesting, if true, was buddy's driving ambition--he had great plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing. as young as he was he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level. we will never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like the rolling stones.<br /><br />the lyrics of many of holly's songs are pretty adolescent; read the lyrics for "peggy sue" or "oh boy!" and you will see what i mean. maybe to a great extent this explains his popularity with adolescent audiences, but his instrumentation and stage performances surely account for his influence on groups to follow--both the rolling stones and the beatles have acknowledged his importance.<br /><br />clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect. for example, i doubt that holly ever punched out a producer in nashville or that the audience at new york's apollo theater was so immediately responsive as to be wildly dancing in the aisles. if you are interested in getting closer to the truth, see the documentary "the real buddy holly story" (1985) that is produced and hosted by a very relaxed and engaging paul mccartney. this contains interviews with holly's family, friends, and band-mates (holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "the buddy holly story"). members of other bands like keith richards and don everly also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old holly performances. the mccartney production can stand on its own, but it makes an excellent companion piece to "the buddy holly story" and perhaps should be required viewing for anyone who watches the fictionalized story.
