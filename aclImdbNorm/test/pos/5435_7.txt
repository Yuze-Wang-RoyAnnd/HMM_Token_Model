robin williams shows his stand-up talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of "what's wrong-in american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people". of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden agendas. i think this movie is for people who likes stand-up and political discussion. and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this. everybody knows hollywood is more liberal/democrat than the bush&co so they have to make these movies every now and then...but this one was perhaps too obvious, at least i thought so, for making any real change.<br /><br />still, great stand-up and fresh political issues and talks...i enjoyed it and thanks to imdb.com ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater, and yes, i laughed many times. sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness....see this movie if you like good and clever stand-up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now. rent it if that doesn't match you.
