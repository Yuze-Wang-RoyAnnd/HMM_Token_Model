i first saw this movie at a premiere-party in mr. zwarts hometown fredrikstad. there, between directors, musicians and other norwegian celebrities i laughed and laughed... i just couldn't stop. if you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and excellent acting - this is one flick you have to see! it's like mixing "true romance" with "the wedding singer" and add a dash of "mad about you" hilarios!<br /><br />10 points!
