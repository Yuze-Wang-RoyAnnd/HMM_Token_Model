watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of british screens. it showed a different side of old australia that we need to see more of. good juxtaposition of old hand and young turk. then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic. it was sadly missed. this show was a cold look at the old way of looking at australia. hard living and hard working. the young idealist clashing with the old practical head. real politicka fighting with the young upstarts of new labour. to add modern political vernacular.<br /><br />this show was the first of its type that i came across that did not try to do a tourist job on australia. it was a great showing of the realistic <br /><br />come documentary realistic type of show. some good films were out at the time doing a similar job. it would be great to see more of this type of tv come from australia for it has been sadly missing this last twenty years. for all we have been fed is the soap pulp of varying quality.
