reading some of the other comments, i must agree that some of the (very few) shortcomings found in this brilliant documentary about one of the 20th century's divas (up there with billie holliday, bessie smith, edith piaf, judy garland and mercedes de sosa) are justified. because initially this was a 6-hours-plus tv documentary about her career("estranha forma de vida" (v) 1995/1999). far more encompassing and with greater insight into am'alia's inner world. as for the subtitling her songs, i'm all for it! though the music, the voice and the performance may be - are! - universal, there is so much poetry in the words just begging to be translated. i think this was a conscious choice by the producers. they were aiming at the 200 million portuguese speakers in brazil, portugal, mozambique, france, east timor, cape verde, guinea-bissau, canada, the us, south africa, st. tome and principe, goa, daman, diu, venezuela, luxembourg, germany and the rest of the portuguese-speaking diaspora worldwide. as for the lady herself, she did not live to see this particular shortened dvd version of the documentary, but she was given a preview of "estranha forma de vida". and it seems to have been to her liking. very much so.
