this is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.<br /><br />i came across it while switching tv channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. i've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.<br /><br />james coburn and slim pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. while being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.
