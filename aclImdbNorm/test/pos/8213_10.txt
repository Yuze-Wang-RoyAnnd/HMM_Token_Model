at last!! sandra bullock is indeed a beautiful woman, but i've finally found a film that she gets to be an actress! forget the predictable keanu-fodder of speed, forget the predictable kleenex-fodder of while you were sleeping - this tests her!<br /><br />and she is great! a techno-feminist role that really works well on screen, on a subject that is very close to the bone. the issues raised don't seem far-fetched at all and the whole experience, helped along by a fine supporting cast, makes for quite an un-nerving couple of hours.<br /><br />you may never enter another chat-room again, in fact i'm getting quite nervous just writing this review...er...bye!
