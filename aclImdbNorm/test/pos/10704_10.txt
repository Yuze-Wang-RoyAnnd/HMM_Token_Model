unlike the previous poster, i liked the celluloid treatment. it looked good, and made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. to me, it didn't detract at all from the power of the documentary's content. in fact, i felt the slickness of the look allowed me to just lose myself that much more in the content. the previous poster was fair to liken the style to a nike commercial; it definitely has that look. but for my tastes, it worked really well (and i am far from a fan of nike commercials).<br /><br />in my opinion, this is how documentary film-making should be done. i can't wait to see the next installments from these promising filmmakers.
