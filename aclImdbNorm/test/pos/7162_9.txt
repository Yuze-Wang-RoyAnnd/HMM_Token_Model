as i've hopped from film to film at the sxsw film festival, this film from the opening night has stayed with me. curious, because it is a dark comedy with quite an absurdist premise.<br /><br />a family of hyper-stressed fundamentalists in a small community of like minds is changed by an auto accident. three of the four have the same near-death experience in which they are fully opened, as each receives a reversal of the concept of original sin (i won't spoil this scene with the specifics). the fourth, a middle school cheerleader, is not just the only one physically hurt, but also is unchanged and is now witness to what has become her crazy, apparently spiritually bankrupt, family. every new moment brings a new outrageousness as they have become innocently naked and frank in every way, horrifying her and then the community.<br /><br />forgiving the franklins has the most beautiful sexual awaking scene between a husband and wife that i have ever seen, to the sarah brightman song "deliver me," a song that can now bring tears to my eyes.<br /><br />the cast is terrific. robertson dean as the dad, vince pavia as the son and aviva as the cheerleader daughter are excellent, mari blackwell plays peggy, the mom's questioning neighbor and best friend perfectly, a much more nuanced, fleshed out, real character than what might have been (everyone in middle america knows a peggy). and theresa willis positively glows as betty, the mom. there are lots of risks taken by the actors playing the three changed characters, and these risks pay off.<br /><br />i hope this film gets a wide release - if so, i plan to see it again.<br /><br />very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
