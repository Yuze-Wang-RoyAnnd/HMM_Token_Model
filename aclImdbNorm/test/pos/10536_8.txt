i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film. i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable. both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out for.<br /><br />the final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen. the kiss was definitely a great payoff, done with great enthusiasm's!! <br /><br />i can only assume that the film was shot on film, and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say.... well deserved.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. it brought back some great memories and some scary ones.
