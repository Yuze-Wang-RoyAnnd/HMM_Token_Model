"americans next top model" is the best reality show! i was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.i kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, i did blink) it can be sad, funny, or addicting.(mostly addicting)"america's next top model" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. it is also on more that one channel. sometimes it's on mtv other times it's not. i hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series! it's great for pretty much all ages so every can enjoy it! :)<br /><br />also, if you watched the show before, haven't you noticed that tyra has a different hair style each time in the judging room? she'll have it short and curly one week, and then long and straight the next.
