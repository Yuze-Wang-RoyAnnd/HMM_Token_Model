this is unfortunately carlin's last recorded hbo concert, from a series that lasted over 30 years. though this may not be his "best" work, it is excellent, funny, and thought provoking. this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts.<br /><br />throughout his long, prolific, and influential career, carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes, towards a more 'humanitarian' viewpoint of society and culture. his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years, and culminates in this performance. though, i would argue that his audio book "when will jesus bring the pork chops?" best displays his vast wit with regards to language, euphemisms, and the breakdown of our values. it's bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer.<br /><br />if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church, you will probably not like any of carlin's stand up material. however, if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy, you would probably greatly enjoy this concert.
