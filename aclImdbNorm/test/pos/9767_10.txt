i remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when it came to an end. over the years since then, i have tried to find out if i could obtain a copy of it on either video or d.v.d., to no avail. however, i was delighted to find this website with details of it, only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase, that the videos available will not play on english recorders! this production was so wonderful, being absolutely accurate with nevil shute's novel, taking the storyline through after the end of the war, with joe and jean's subsequent life together - absolutely marvellous - and i just wish i were able to see it again, as since it's original screening, there have been no repeats of it on british television.
