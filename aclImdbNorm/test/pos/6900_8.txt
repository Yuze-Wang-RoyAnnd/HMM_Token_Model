ok. finally, a horror film that's done well. as soon as i heard the music, i knew that some effort had been made in creating what i consider to be an almost masterpiece of good ol'horror. zombies, whores, booze, grave snatching and a lot more. a great cast, well acted, well directed, well written---there was hardly a flaw. even the american actors with irish/english accents really pulled it off. i thought that the actor larry fessenden looked familiar to me. it was that missing tooth. finally i realized that this guy was the lead in "habit" a film about vampires in nyc. i thought he was excellent in that role. now i'm wondering if he's an american or not. his accent was so convincing in "i sell," that i thought he had to have grown up in the emerald isle, not in the us. well apparently he's a born and raised new yorker. a great actor--really made the role his own in this movie. nothing beats a horror flick set in early 19th century europe (like the old hammer flicks.) i encourage anyone that wants to have a great time to watch this well crafted movie.
