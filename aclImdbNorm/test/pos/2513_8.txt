this is an unusual film because although it was made by twentieth-century fox because it's one of the few pairings of barbara stanwyck and her future husband, robert taylor. barbara stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (rko, paramount and selznick) at about the time she made this is my affair, but taylor was an mgm contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.<br /><br />the film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction. you'll see actors playing william mckinley, teddy roosevelt and admiral dewey. i can't recall any film with mckinley or dewey in it as a character, though i do remember roosevelt from the wind and the lion and a couple other films. three cheers for seeing a "lesser president" in a film as a major character! <br /><br />the film begins with mckinley taking a young lieutenant (robert taylor) aside and asking him to be a special agent for him--and telling no one--not even the secret service. that's because the president fears that someone within the agency is tipping off a gang that has been making a long string of robberies--all based on inside information. so it's up to taylor (who is not known for his manly roles--especially at this stage of his career) to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible and the inside man.<br /><br />however, there are two serious complications. first, while he is able to find the gang members, one of the gang member's step-sister is stanwyck. taylor finds that he's fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities. second, because mckinley is the only other person who knows the truth, serious problems develop when mckinley is assassinated and taylor is on death row for the crimes!!! <br /><br />the film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context. while today most people don't remember mckinley nor remember that he was assassinated, the film is set in this interesting time period. the acting is pretty decent, as the stars are supported by victor mclaglen and brian donlevy, though i must admit that donlevy's role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. overall, it's very interesting, well written and not too sappy in the romance department. a good outing for all.
