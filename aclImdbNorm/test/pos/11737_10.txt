cliche romance drama movie with very simple plot but very good cinematography and script.the screenplay,directing and acting was also good.the flow of the movie is kind of manipulative in order to bring the audience to tears through the excellent love music and circumstance which works but later on after the movie,makes one feel raped in a way.jones makes her character very memorable and lovable though.a deeper story could have reaaly taken this movie to a higher level but still,the movie delivers for it's genre.only for hopeless romantics,big love story fans,big soap drama fans,50's cinemascope cinematography fans and fans of the lead actors.....
