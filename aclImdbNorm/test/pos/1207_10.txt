i first saw this film in the early 80's on cable. it was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race, and a bunch of things i'm certain i missed. however about a year ago it came back into my life as i started enjoying it with my son. he's a little young (9) for a lot of the themes in it, but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that end is ironic. while i can't think of other films in this genre, it does have a stand alone genius i love. it also does a unique justice to central park. most musicals are lost on me, one way or another. "tommy" was over the top and heavy handed in direction, "oliver" seemed like crowd control on the silver screen, "the wall" was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble, but listening to "failure of the flesh" from hair sounds right for our times today, as it did in the eighties, as it must have in the sixties...truly timeless.
