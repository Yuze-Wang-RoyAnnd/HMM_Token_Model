i saw this movie over 5 years ago and the subject still infuriates me, as it should. her anger and initiative were inspiring. not that i would takeover an army and kill people, but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind. this is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter.
