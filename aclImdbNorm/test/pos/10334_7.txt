i haven't seen this movie in 30 years so i don't know if i would like it as much as i did when i was 12. at the time, however, i loved this movie. this is a great "starter chick-flick" for young pre-teen girls. be careful of the ending, though. there are tears and harsh emotions.<br /><br />looking back at it from a 2008 perspective (with so much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), i think it would be interesting to watch again. patty's uncaring, abusive father, indifferent mother and favored sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for companionship. patty was sad when anton left. she was heartbroken when he was killed. the rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking. after all, she was only 12 years old.<br /><br />the thing that i most strongly retained is how this movie taught me even "enemy" soldiers are people too. not all german soldiers were hateful nazis. when i was older, i saw tv shows like hogan's heroes and the rat patrol which also made the point that the "regular" german soldiers were not the same as the gestapo.<br /><br />"regular" soldiers were drafted. the gestapo were handpicked among volunteers for their special attitudes of hate. i believe that one of the privileges of being a nazi was that they had special assignments and, therefore, didn't go into battle. their specialties were interrogation and torture.<br /><br />later, during the cold war, i would think about russian soldiers and remember somgs. we were taught that the soviet union was "evil". but the reality was that russian soldiers weren't out to destroy america. they had a job. their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life. which, in a way, was true, since the us fought to end communism.<br /><br />the lesson is still applicable today. german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al qaeda.
