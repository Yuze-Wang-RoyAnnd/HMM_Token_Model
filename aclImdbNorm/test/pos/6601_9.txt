right there. good, entertaining and accurate era-feel to most scenes. enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story distractions from the exceptions. the credits show peralta from mar vista, california.. up the hill from venice and south of malibu. i lived there in the heartbreak hotel days, pre-beachboys, next to that surfer kid bob cooper up on wasatch avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. old skatekey skatewheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down sidewalk waves. things were different in each succeeding decade as the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the warmth of the sun whitewater freedom and exhilaration of the electric sixties and then into the assertively innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary madness of the weird seventies. the movie gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real.. the source of culturally significant influences. and btw, there's another movie that has a similarly american street edginess to it, and has the same genuinely unique goodness with laid back realness that helps refine that elusively eternal sense of cool.. "two lane blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesouldoit attitude in west coast california history.. dennis wilson). like monte hellman did with that one, thanks, sp, for being right there with this one. gwr
