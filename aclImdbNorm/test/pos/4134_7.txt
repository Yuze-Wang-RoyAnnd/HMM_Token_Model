i've got to say it. gary busey saved this film. if it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. i recommend the film but just barely.<br /><br />the biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. for example, why is lubbock green and hilly? how come buddy's producer petty ignored? where are the daily trips to the clovis, new mexico studio? why is nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the holly sound? why was buddy's two week courtship to maria treated as a complex, taboo, race mixing stereotype? why are buddy's tile boxes as light as feathers? finally, why are the crickets portrayed as trouble making roadblocks to holly's talent?<br /><br />taken on their face these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film proclaiming itself, "the buddy holly story." however, busey does deliver a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died.
