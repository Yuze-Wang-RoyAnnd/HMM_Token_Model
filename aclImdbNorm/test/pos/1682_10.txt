the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics. while the theme seems common, what "makes" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.<br /><br />the characters are played with conviction. you feel the innocence of the lead, and his innocence lost. the politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake.<br /><br />the camera work is impressive. it affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue. ditto for the music.<br /><br />the story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres. a very canny strategy by the writer/director. the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes.<br /><br />the movie was like a good mystery book. something was "afoot"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know exactly what it could be - you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn't noticed you were holding in. saddened, shaking your head.<br /><br />a story well written and well told. 3 cheers to a young writer/director.
