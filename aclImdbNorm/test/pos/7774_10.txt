after viewing this movie, lets say, around 8 times, the story line has never bored me. each character has their own distinct personality and their own views of "love". this movie has timeless, almost realistic, love lessons. filled with philosophies on love, a jazzy soundtrack, and great actors is why i would call it a classic.
