on a dark, gloomy new year's eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that david holm be presented to her at once. we don't yet know who david holm is, or why this nurse wishes to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time. on the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery, holm (victor sj"ostr"om, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the new year. "here we can tell just when to drink the new year in," exclaims holm, casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness. little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.<br /><br />to pass the time, holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. he'd once had a friend name george, "a merry fellow" who was "smarter than the rest of us." on one new year's eve several years ago, george has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased. "and, gentlemen, george died last new year's eve!" concludes holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs.<br /><br />as fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight. as the man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom carriage. the driver, a frail cloaked figure - a sickle clasped tightly in his hand - steps down from the carriage and approaches. we are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit george, preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor.<br /><br />considering the era in which 'k"orkarlen' is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. cinematographer julius jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver. even today, the end result is highly effective. a particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man. another scene, eerily reminiscent of jack torrance (jack nicholson) in stanley kubrick's 'the shining,' involves holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.<br /><br />genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution, victor sj"ostr"om's 'k"orkarlen' is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of redemption.
