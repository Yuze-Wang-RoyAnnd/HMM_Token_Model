probably this is the best film of clint eastwood. here action is minimal, but with plenty of good acting. a yankee soldier eastwood is wounded and taken by the female pupils and teachers of a school in the south, where he is hidden and taken care. shortly after his recovery all ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them succeeded including the director of the school(geraldine page). erotic scenes are coming until the ladies discovered that their "macho" was shared by several of them, so they became angry and poisoned him in a farewell dinner. geraldine page, although somewhat old, was able to play a very suggestive role as the director of the school, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.
