there was a recent documentary on making movies, that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies. one common theme was you can have a great script, great cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie.<br /><br />down periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory. not an original or terribly well written screenplay. a few solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! it would be easy to just say that kelsey grammar carried this movie, but that isn't truly the case. other character actors, like rob schneider, and the hilarious harland williams, added significantly to the enjoyability of the film.<br /><br />cast dynamics, or that mysterious "movie magic" are really what happened here, creating a film that flows smoothly, has incredibly well executed transitions and line after line of well written and well performed dialog.<br /><br />a preposterous premise, lots and lots of technical inaccuracies and just plan silly things that could not happen in the real world, or the real navy, but you just don't care. as a merchant marine myself, i found that the overall feel of the movie, while not plausible, was also not too far off the mark as far as life at sea goes.<br /><br />this is a very funny movie, a good family film, and, particularly if your a fan, lots of kelsey grammar wit, sarcasm and just damn funniness.
