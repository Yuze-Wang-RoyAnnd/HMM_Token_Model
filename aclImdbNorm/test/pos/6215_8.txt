in the spirit of the great space coaster, but a few years earlier.<br /><br />hot fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that i grew up on. seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, i recall him wearing a variety of elton john-type shades.<br /><br />he "played" piano, and had a jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. they would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it.<br /><br />don't remember much else except the opening theme, seymour and the hippie.<br /><br />no one else i know remembers it at all. i grew up in jersey, so if it was produced in detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. seymour reminded me a lot of sherlock the squirrel from the magic garden (another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) people always talk about lsd's effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well.
