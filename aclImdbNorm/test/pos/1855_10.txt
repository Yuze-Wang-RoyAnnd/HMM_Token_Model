return to me is a movie you will want to own. it is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. the story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. david duchovny and minnie driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. but the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. carol o'connor as minnie driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene. bonnie hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines minnie as a 'sister' is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with james belushi as her husband. classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times.
