i watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. i was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though i find nirvana overrated). it sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. jansen puts in little touches like the books (kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. i like when i see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. and you can really feel that in this. there are tons of scenes and moments that i love, i am trying to think now of some other films that are like this and i would say the only thing i can think of are cameron crowe films. takes little moments and makes them stand out and special. the soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the film. this film is amazingly shot, and the editing is outstanding. i could really go on and on about the film. i cannot recommend this enough really. if you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly put his heart into his work then check this out.
