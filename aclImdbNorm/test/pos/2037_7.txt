surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. but the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clich'es in the final act. i enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball "almost famous". it has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****
