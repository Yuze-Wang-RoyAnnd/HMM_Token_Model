well... what to say.<br /><br />i think i shall start with a confession. i have cried 4 times in my life. once when my dad died, twice due to a girlfriend in high school, and at the end of this film. this film deals with the real confronting issues of 6 school kids, forcing them quite uncomfortably into the open for all the world to see. i have never seen a film that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and i doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes.<br /><br />it starts off with a suicide. at 2:37pm. then without letting you know who it was that died, the story begins to be told from the start of the day. it follows the lives of 6 school kids up until 2:37pm. it interchangeably, and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers, lets you know everything about their lives. their loves, hates, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false confidence, self loathing, corruption and arrogance. the overall outcome of which is a sort of "whodunnit" trying to discover the identity of the suicidal before it is revealed at the end of the film. without spoiling anything i must let you know. do not feel cheated by the ending. it contains a very important lesson.<br /><br />and now a warning. this film is definitely not for the faint hearted. many people actually walked out of the cinema half way through when i saw it. disgusted by some of it's content. or perhaps it's that it's sometimes hard to face the cold hard truth of reality. this is what high school is like for many people. i'm sure most would agree.
