they loved him up and turned him into a horny toad! god, that gets to me every time.<br /><br />this is a great movie. memorable lines, from "thank god your momma died given birth; she'da seen ya she'da died of shame" to "i don't understand, big dan." great scenes, from the opening train scene (laughed so hard i cried) to the bluegrass.<br /><br />watch it. it's good, it's great, it's funny, and it's based on a famous story. worth your while, believe me. don't watch this if you have a weak bladder, for you will definitely wet your pants laughing.
