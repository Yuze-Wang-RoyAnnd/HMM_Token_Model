if you have ever babysat in a house you didn't know, or if you saw the original and enjoyed it then this will be a good choice. ignoring the reviews and what was posted here, i went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teen. this movie has (of course)changed some of the original story to relate to todays teens, such as the babysitter is in trouble for going over on her cell phone minutes and has to take on a babysitting job to pay her bill. however, it sticks to the original story line pretty well. if you can relate to the babysitter, not knowing the house and it's usual pops and cracks it is quite suspenseful. when the killer is shown he is very creepy and you find yourself yelling at the girl to "get out of the house". if you have never babysat or been in a situation like this then you probably will not be able to relate and will not like it. it's all about understanding her fear.
