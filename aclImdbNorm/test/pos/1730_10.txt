i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing up.(got introduced to the doctor by way of john pertwee)as well as "camera copies" of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts. i had a great time w/ the show, but it never seemed to take itself seriously - i mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. i went to the cons, did the costume bit (doctor#5,6 and tegan were my costume characters), loved it. then it all came to a sudden halt. program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a 25year old antique that drifted into the ethos.<br /><br />when i heard that the sci-fi channel had picked up the new doctor, my first thought was, "cool, now my 11 year old son can see what i've been babbling on about all these years, and know what the heck a tardis is" (i have several phone boxes and tardises of various sizes around the house)i didn't expect the excellent quality of story, character development and f/x. i was to say the least - pleased. for the first time, i found a doctor that wasn't a curmudgeon, a clown, a fop, a trip-head, a pussy, or a jerk. christopher eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date.now, now, calm down tom baker fans! don't get me wrong, i loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but christopher gave something to the doctor that he'd never had before - real word believability. i'm just sad that he decided against another season. i'll try out david tennant as i would any other doctor, but now the bar has risen...<br /><br />bad wolf rules!!!!!<br /><br />2008 update - i love david tennant! his "mod" persona is something that my generation remembers, my son's generation can deal with, and fashion gestapo can relax! he's a little more human than christopher, but not as humas as other former doctors. i miss rose, i dig martha, and what were they thinking with donna noble!?!? it's still the best ride on tv
