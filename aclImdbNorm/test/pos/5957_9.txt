i just saw this film last night, and i have to say that i loved every minute. if taken in the spirit of a parody of bond-esquire films, it's truly superior. the true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. the misogyny, cultural insensitivity, and almost laughable macho-ism of the films of this genre are used for major comic effect. it also calls the illogic and formulaic elements to task, with agent oss 117 constantly learning difficult things insanely quick (such as arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetically obvious clues. some of the lines from the film left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished...and i have to say i have learned some...interesting...french vocabulary that would probably have my professors quite exasperated with me were i to use. all in all, i thought this film excellent. intensely funny and the first film i've ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of the spy film.
