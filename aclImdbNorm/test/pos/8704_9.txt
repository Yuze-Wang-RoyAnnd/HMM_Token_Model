i was ten years old when i saw subspecies, i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate, they really do have some great on-screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie. i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this: ion and rosa, the servants, have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king. what most people don't know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene: michelle and stefan get cornered into a room and michelle has the idea for stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off radu and her demonic controlled ex-friends. however, for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera. another scene in the script, that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin.<br /><br />this movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters; even though my favorite characters were stefan and michelle i think anders hove's radu is pure feeling-evocative acting, so much feeling in his work there.
