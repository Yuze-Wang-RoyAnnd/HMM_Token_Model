it was harrowingly close, but the china syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when as it was going into theatrical release, the accident at three mile island nuclear power plant happened. i still remember the whole country's attention was glued onto hourly bulletins coming out of harrisburg, pennsylvania. and wouldn't you know it, a scientist in the china syndrome describes the worst case scenario as rendering an area as large as the state of pennsylvania uninhabitable.<br /><br />less than a decade later in the ukraine at chernobyl, the soviet union in its last days dealt with such a crisis that didn't get righted in the nick of time. the china syndrome once again became a relevant movie.<br /><br />the film is more about cutting corners for safety than it is about being anti-nuclear. jack lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power all his life as the captain of an atomic power submarine. what angers him and sets him off to create the confrontation that climaxes the film is the stupidity and greed of the power company managers. stupidity and greed though are commodities found every day. the problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society.<br /><br />lemmon shares star billing with a couple of famous hollywood offspring, jane fonda and michael douglas. jane is a tv news reporter who is constantly being assigned to puff feature stories and just happens to be at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. the cover-up by her own station and her later meeting with lemmon set off the chain of events depicted in the china syndrome.<br /><br />fonda's best scene i thought however was with peter donat a news executive with her station. take a look at her facial expressions as donat fluffs off the importance of the story and patronizingly tells her that her very beauty demands she stick to puff pieces. fonda knows she's got something and sticks with it.<br /><br />michael douglas plays her iconoclastic cameraman, this was a typical part for him back in the day. in his tcm tribute to his father kirk douglas, michael said he opted for roles showing sensitivity. still i could have seen a young kirk douglas in this part.<br /><br />what to do about energy for industrial and post industrial nations, a vexing problem that will bedevil our government for a couple of generations to come. this film shows what can happen with a dependence on nuclear power. our current problems geopolitically in the world stem in part from a dependence on fossil fuel, specifically oil. everything we use brings consequence some unforeseen. <br /><br />the real hero of the film in my opinion is wilford brimley, lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. in the end brimley really steps up to the plate.<br /><br />see the china syndrome to know what i'm talking about.
