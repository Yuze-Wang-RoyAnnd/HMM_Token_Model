i don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while i did. i got so engrossed i gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. and i sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but i was crying at the end. a lot of emotional nuance. great acting, and good southern feel. john corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played luke was really good too. highly recommend.
