this is the australian tv series. it is a classic. the stories and actors are excellent. who can forget picker and his gramophone or chet being ambushed? this is cult tv. the australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in the outsiders. what can i say timeless adventure. the music and song just fantastic. the closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel, then keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that. all 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrayal of the australian myth and i think this is what this series has.it does not matter that the two main characters were from overseas, i think that is the key to the series and why it is so good.
