for us, an abbott and costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for. i'm very happy i recorded this -- my wife remembered it from when she was young, but i had never seen it. the family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was selected.<br /><br />our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us -- always complaining in the beginning, but most often coming around. she mostly ignored this in the beginning, preferring to check her email, but she started enjoying herself -- many times laughing out loud to the zaniness.<br /><br />it's wonderful to think you can have a fun evening with a 55yr old. the mono-colour introduction that blends into the full-colour fairy tale. it's a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with, that includes a little song and a little dance, along with everything you expect lou and bud to delivery.<br /><br />watch it with your children and have a very fun evening!
