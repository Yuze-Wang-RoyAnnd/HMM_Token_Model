i am a new convert you might as well say. i borrowed the dvds from my local library. i have been interested in samurai since watching 'the last samurai.' my dad told me he used to watch shintaro when he was a kid. he said that it was pretty good. we are up to series 3. i absolutely love it. it takes a little to get used to the dubbed english voices over the characters speaking japanese but i really enjoy it all the same. it is a little strange to watch the slight pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at characters and they stick into a tree or wall. i was not used to this but i am now. but i suppose that's the technology they had in the 60s. i've noticed that shintaro is kind, friendly, willing to help those in need, he's very humble, most of the time he doesn't big note himself (he only says he is better than the enemy ninja). i admire shintaro for these qualities. it's really interesting to watch the swordsmanship that koichi ose has. it is amazing. this series is for anyone who are interested in samurai.
