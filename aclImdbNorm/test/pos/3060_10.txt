how can anyone dare say anything bad about this film? pardon mel brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.<br /><br />the first time i saw this, i cried from laughing so hard. everything about it is funny.<br /><br />while "robin hood: men in tights" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by "real genius"), it ranks way up there in my book. so go see it! if you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over cary elwes.
