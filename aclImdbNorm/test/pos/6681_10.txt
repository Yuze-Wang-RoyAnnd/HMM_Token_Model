if you have enjoyed the butterfly effect, donnie darko or the machinist, you will enjoy k-pax too.<br /><br />to me, this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end. spacey delivers a great performance as prot. also, lets not forget the appearance of saul williams in the movie, who i am a big fan of.<br /><br />after watching it, i recommended the movie to lots of my friends, and everyone was pretty much blown away.<br /><br />but still, it is very underrated, maybe because of the lack of action and explosions. i'm sorry, this is not a movie about blowing things up, it's about how humans behave, and how people live in worlds that don't exist.<br /><br />go on, and enjoy.
