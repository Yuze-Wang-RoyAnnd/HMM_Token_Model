never had i seen such a powerful true story movie. i discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a nobel prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema.<br /><br />if you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything .<br /><br />a great lesson of courage, humility and life.<br /><br />i haven't seen anything as good since.<br /><br />t.e. saturday, january 9th, 1999
