bedrooms and hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 melbourne film festival. from the uk, it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas. much of the humour is centred around a new-agey men's self-help group where they pass around various implements like the 'rock of truth'. they also go on a 'hunter gatherer' weekend with hilarious results. trust me, you'll laugh your teeth out.
