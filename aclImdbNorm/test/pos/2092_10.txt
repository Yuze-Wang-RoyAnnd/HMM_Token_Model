to be totally honest i wasn't expecting much at all going into 9 souls even after reading heap upon heap of praise plied upon it but to say i was surprised would be a major understatement, in short i was totally blown away.<br /><br />the basic plot is as simple as they come, nine prison inmates ranging from a drug pusher all the way up to multiple murderer's escape from prison and go in search of a secret stash presumed to be forged money hidden by a tenth inmate who cracked and was dragged away by guards shortly before their escape but it's the direction that director toshiaki toyoda takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original perfectly blending drama, comedy and violence creating a truly one of kind movie that deserve's to be seen not only fans of asian cinema but cinema in general.<br /><br />superbly acted, emotional, funny, violent and at times very surreal this is a movie has it all.
