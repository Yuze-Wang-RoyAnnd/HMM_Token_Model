was very fortunate to see the movie hari om at the bermuda international film festival. it was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. it was shot beautifully around india and i want to go there now. the main actor..vijay was absolutely incredible. he was the highlight of the movie. apparently he was also in the movie..monsoon wedding. he was the total star of the show. benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. and the girl (forget the name) was great too. they were all great! there were many tremendous scenes like the one with the monkeys. and basically i just loved the movie. everyone walking out was raving about it and it was certainly a high point of the film festival. was my favorite from the festival. it really beautifully captured the liveliness of india and can't believe how beautiful india is. the feeling upon walking out of the cinema..was a real high. it is a delightful, happy film. i loved it!!
