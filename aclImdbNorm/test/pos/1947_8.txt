i finally saw this on video, after years of hearing about it. it is by no means a perfect movie, but it is oddly hypnotic - one of those rare, special films that creates its own world. <br /><br />***spoilers*** first, the bad stuff. the scenes in burkewaite's class are excruciating. even if the subject is social studies, this guy is way over the top. his speeches are so overwrought they are laughable. and no teachers i ever had would grill their students like that, and tell the ones who protest to "shut up!". these scenes are brief, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. next, how the heck does layne just walk out of the police station near the end? also, what happened to samson's car after the first scene of him riding into town? he spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by layne or feck. ***end spoilers***<br /><br /> ahhh, feck...this guy is great. dennis hopper effortlessly steals the movie. "check's in the mail", "i love company", "you're my friend" - every line is a classic. he gives feck an internal logic that makes the story work. incredibly, he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when samson talks about his (samson's) future. <br /><br /> by contrast, crispin glover is hard to take sometimes. yet the scenes of him driving around in the beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do, and buds to do it with. matt's low-key attitude makes a good foil for layne - their friendship is believable. glover's mannerisms are a little much, but he is consistent throughout. he drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this flick if layne were as much of a zombie as matt or samson - snoozefest! <br /><br />***spoilers*** what makes "river's edge" unsettling is the fact that samson is not really evil, in the usual sense. he is kind of a boring guy who got sick of being taken for granted - in other words, he is like thousands of other boring guys. after he kills jamie, he starts to unravel, which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will snap again. ***end spoilers***<br /><br />part of this movie's appeal is the way the action stays centered around the teens and their point of view. the parents are comic relief - clarissa's mom, tony's dad - or overwhelmed - matt's mom. this underlines how the kids hang together for the attention no one else gives them. it keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique, and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is feck. "river's edge" is a textbook on alienation. it conveys how awkward, mysterious, and disconcerting adolescence is like no other film.
