contains spoilers i had it recorded a while ago when it was on pbs but never got a chance to watch it (probably due to prejudice about having to sit through 5-6 hrs of masterpiece theater, with its bbc made for tv production style (no music, settings all in one room, no outdoor scenes flat tv look...)) but after watching the movie traffic (which i thought was pretty good at that time,) i couldn't help digging up the traffik tape to see what else could they have dwelled into with the extra 2 1/2 hr.<br /><br />boy, was my preconceptions wrong about this tv series. it is so much more involving than traffic. the characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable. and the whole subplot involving pakistan completes the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. in traffic, the pakistan story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot.<br /><br />there was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug, whereas in traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance. same with social issues, which in traffik, were conveyed realistically w/o sounding preachy. whereas in traffic, the characters jus t blurted it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for tv "issue of the week" movies.<br /><br />there was no bad guy vs good guy in traffik, even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie that sells to support his habit instead of the "nobody messes with me" type of person in traffic.<br /><br />the only down part is that since i watched traffic not much before watching this, it was hard not to compare scene by scene, and even though the scenes were not the same, i knew what the outcome was going to be already. thank god for the pakistan story, which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely w/o thinking which scene it compares to. although i was thrown off thinking the drugs were fused into the ceramic of the statues in which helen brought back to germany (as in the storyline of traffic.) thank god traffik was not that hokey and far-fetched.
