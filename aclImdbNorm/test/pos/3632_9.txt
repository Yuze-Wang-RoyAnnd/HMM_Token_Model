very touching film, a great surprise to come up from brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... magical realism is a very hard task, and i believe jo~ao falc~ao has made it wonderfully. it seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. another mistake is to think that falc~ao has been influenced by the series "hoje 'e dia de maria". the tv series produced by globo was made after the film, but aired before... unfortunately.<br /><br />the negative point is the photography, by walter carvalho. it seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept falc~ao has created. the story is captivating and universal, in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in brazil. that could take place anywhere in the world. a great movie, i strongly recommend.
