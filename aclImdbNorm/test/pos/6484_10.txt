my first review at imdb, after a few years of using this site constantly...<br /><br />anyways, saw this on the tube the other night, loved it. it's in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute, but much better. was sure for a moment that rex was speedy levitch, in waking life, but after checking, it doesn't seem so.<br /><br />i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry, but i also think these people are close-minded. admittedly the ending wasn't quite what i was hoping for, but overall it was so unique and well-acted, i can't complain. i wouldn't call this cheesy, as one reviewer did, it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80's did. and they refrained from playing any really dateable 80's music.<br /><br />can't remember everything that made me smile when i saw this, but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and whether i share rex's beliefs or not, i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life. and his mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. he rambled a lot as well, but they showed how confused he was at times, and why he might have some psychological issues. and then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire, a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them.<br /><br />also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher. usually actors fail at that role. he pulled it off brilliantly.<br /><br />if you enjoyed waking life, i say watch this movie if you get a chance.<br /><br />9.5/10<br /><br />pk
