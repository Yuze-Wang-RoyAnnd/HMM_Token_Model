great show! about time a reality tv show comes along that closes generation gaps. contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. and others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. grease has truly become an american icon. grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. "you're the one that we want" is sure to gain even more grease followers. the only thing i wish there had been more of is character history, then again it is kind of nice to leave some of it to the nostalgic imagination of the 50's. cant wait to watch the next show...and then on broadway!!!
