starting with a "my name is joe" like scene in alcoholics anonymous tbm careers into a mad spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers?<br /><br />a genuinely funny film, with some of the most outrageous characters since the birdcage, plot and subplot are intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent parisian life (ever been to a wedding reception in the gents toilet where the brides grandmother and her deranged girlfriend are smoking dope and cracking blue jokes? no, me either!) leading to a final scene of almost arcadian symbolism.<br /><br />excellent.
