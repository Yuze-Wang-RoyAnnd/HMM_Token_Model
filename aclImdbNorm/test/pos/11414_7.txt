i don't watch very many 'horror' movies, but one night i sat down and watched this with my cousins. now, we're teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really wasn't very good, especially at the beginning. one line that stood out was when scarlett says to jill and tiffany, "this is so... high school!" while the next scene shows jill walking past a sign with their high school name on it... many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny, badly-written, badly-acted lizzie mcguire episode. however, as the story progressed, and the cast moved on to just about only jill most of the time, i was able to appreciate the movie more. camilla belle did really well in this movie, and i think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her. and i must admit, this was one of the scariest movies i've ever seen. well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen. and this movie really reminded me of what really is scary... we all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives, but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen. the only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most clich'e movies i've ever seen. it has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had- turning the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream, etc. at the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, i would give it a 7/10. it's definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />by the way, this is my first review, so i don't know if any of those things were spoilers.. but just to be safe...
