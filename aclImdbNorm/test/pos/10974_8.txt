no bullets, no secret agents, a story that is entertaining, funny, and believable. met some of the producers/actors in this film at the theater. they seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen. you may not hear about this movie on tv with high-dollar ad spots, but it is definitely worth checking out. i have spent $8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren't this entertaining. looking forward to future projects by this production company.
