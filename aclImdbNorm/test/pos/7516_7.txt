george scott gave the performance of a lifetime in paddy chayefsky's the hospital, a very dark drama about an aging big city hospital and a middle-aged physician on the verge of suicide. along comes diana rigg as a free spirit determined to save him from himself. their dialog crackles, and it is clear they are made for each other from the outset. but will she save him? their one sex scene is both graphic and memorable for its passion and fury. meanwhile, the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who don't want it to turn a condemned building into a cancer center. and a serial killer is loose in the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. a good part of the movie, though, is squarely focused on scott. as it should be. what a difference a few years made back when this movie was made. 1962 had given us the interns, a hokey, old-fashioned reworking of dr. kildare with terrible acting and a cardboard script. along came 1971 and the hospital. less than 10 years later. hollywood did something right for a change. watching the hospital today is a reminder of how much medical shows like st. elsewhere and scrubs owe to this enduring classic. and if the hospital reminds you of network, it should. same scripter.
