the railway children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast,the warm,humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful english countryside. jenny augutter is especially believable in her role as 'bobbie' the older sibling of her sister phyllis and brother peter.the adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating.the scenery is lovely,the trains a part of britain's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving. this heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes,each and every time as well as makes me homesick.i often wonder if i should have been born in that era as i think i would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency.<br /><br />in short i consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a 'sensitive or caring type'.edith nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900's and what a wonderful story it is.more kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games.if we had more films of this nature ,the world would become a better place.
