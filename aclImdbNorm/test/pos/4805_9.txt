terrific, deeply moving crime thriller starring andy lau and lau ching wan.<br /><br />from the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion, this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat.<br /><br />johnny to, again working with ace composer arthur wong, constructs another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries.<br /><br />to's images are strong and moving. his cutting, combined with the extraordinary music cues, is exemplary. you are in the hands of a master cinematician.<br /><br />the two sequences in which andy lau "hides" from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty (ruby wong) are testament to to's unique directorial skills.<br /><br />lau ching wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while andy lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death.<br /><br />this is superb movie-making, only mildly compromised by some bad english dubbing in one scene with criminal waise lee.
