it's taken years for cult icon bruce campbell to get this project off the ground - but he finally has, it's here - and what a great piece of schlock entertainment it is! looking at the plot; it sounds like two things. a great base for a very silly b-movie, and a shameless excuse for bruce campbell to what he does best - evil dead ii style slapstick humour, and this film delivers on both counts. the man with the screaming brain is comic book nonsense all the way through - but there's some really great scenes, and it's almost impossible to be bored with this movie. bruce campbell wrote, directs, produces and stars in this film - and while it's not quite citizen kane, it has to be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for battling off his own hand in a woodland cabin. the plot follows american businessman william cole on a business trip to bulgaria with his girlfriend. the trip goes awry, however, when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead; thanks to the same woman. mad scientist stacy keach is on hand to merge cole and the taxi driver's brains into one; and we've got a cult flick on our hands.<br /><br />the first half hour or so is entertaining and features a few laughs; but once the main plot point has been executed; the movie really picks up. bruce makes best use of the scenario in all kinds of silly situations, from changing his clothes in a waste bin, to deciding (with the taxi driver in his brain) what to eat in a restaurant. the humour is mostly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who enjoyed evil dead ii (which should be anyone who's seen it), will no doubt enjoy this too. it does feel like campbell is playing to his strengths a little bit too much with this whole project, but if you tuned in and didn't see bruce doing what he does best, disappointment would ensue. besides that, no disrespect to the man; but he's never been the actor with the greatest range. despite being lots of fun; the movie isn't great, as it gets a little bit too silly at times; and there's a whole sub-plot with a robot that i didn't like; but overall, the man with the screaming brain is a film that we, sadly, don't see too much of nowadays. the film is an all-out, no holds barred, b-movie; and it deserves respect for that if nothing else.
