the above line sums it up pretty good. the best assets of the comics are it's visual gags and word-jokes (the latter of which are almost impossible to translate, which is why the comics are at their best in their original language).<br /><br />both are quite hard to capture in film, which is why those will never be as good as the comics. movies are simply a different medium than comics. with that in mind, this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic.<br /><br />the word gags are bearable, and sometimes even funny (debouze does an amelie reference!). i have to mention that i watched the french version. if you don't watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles, the word jokes will probably suck.<br /><br />the slapstick is okay as well; it's a very simple form of humor, and not really funny when you're older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. the other visual jokes are the movie's saving grace for the older audience, as their often quite funny.<br /><br />the acting is totally over the top, but again, that's not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. only depardieu and clavier don't really overact, which might be the reason some people think they didn't enjoy their roles (i didn't notice a thing). on the other hand jamel debouze and especially claude rich turn overacting into an artform. it's actually fun to watch. again, i fear it wouldn't be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed.<br /><br />overall not a bad movie at all, much better than the previous one. it's not a classic and it doesn't dethrone the twelve tasks of asterix as my favourite asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. the french version, that is. 7/10
