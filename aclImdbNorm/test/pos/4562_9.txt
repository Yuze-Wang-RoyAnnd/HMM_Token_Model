this is one of the most satisfying of the book to tv adaptations. the actress who make us believe that a borg could be sexy makes us believe that a spy and traitor can have some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />the tv plot line does not follow cornwell's story exactly but is both exciting and rewarding as a retelling of a darn good yarn. if you have a yen for romance in uniform there is a lot of sexual energy sparking between our man sharpe and the lying hussy. made me wish her role was closer to that in the books. but no matter there is enough hero wronged, hero redeemed, hero in rage, hero in flight and hero in battle to keep you clued to your dvd play.
