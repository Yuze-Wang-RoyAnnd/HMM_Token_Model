highly politically charged drama that, while biased, is extremely well-handled and one of the most intelligent films ever made. it contains almost no preaching, but rather follows a naive tv reporter who gradually comes to realize the threat presented by nuclear power plants, not because of an inherent danger, but because the purveyors are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of those affected.<br /><br />many hated the film because they saw it as a political tract made by ultra-liberals like jane fonda and michael douglas, but if you view it simply as a drama, it's gripping, exciting, full of well-developed, distinctive characters and, ultimately, a truly suspenseful contemporary thriller that hits close to home.<br /><br />historical note: for some, especially those in the energy industry and inhabitants of the harrisburg, pa metro area, it hit perhaps a little too close to home, as less than a week after this film was released, the devastating explosion at the three mile island nuclear facility occurred.<br /><br />update, 04/08/2007: in the nearly a decade since i first wrote this critique, i've heard a lot of commentary on the film. one thing i think really needs to be noted is that this film is not the "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear tirade that it's often tagged as being.<br /><br />while the makers and stars are (or were) notable "hollywood establishment" liberals, what this film attacks is not the very idea of nuclear power, but rather the idea of human greed, corruption and fallibility calling into question the potential hazards of something that nature has already made dangerous.<br /><br />no one who accepts reality can argue the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal. close friends of mine who worked at a nuclear plant for several years even told me of their employer's official policy on the maximum "safe" exposure levels that its employees could handle.<br /><br />you don't have to believe that corporations are inherently evil in order to accept that individuals, in pursuit of wealth and power, are greedy and often corrupt. and even if you refute that claim, you can't dispute that all humans are prone to make mistakes. when it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can't afford any mistakes, and that, more than anything, is the argument this film seeks to make.<br /><br />condemn it if you must, but try to have a little perspective. we're currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are quite different from those originally predicted, an incredibly costly war with no end in sight. and whether or not you feel the war was necessary to combat global terrorism, you can't dispute the reality that the length, the financial cost, and most importantly the loss of human life have all far exceeded the levels that the "experts" assured us of back in 2003. so even if no one involved is greedy or corrupt, "mistakes were made," and mistakes of a pretty serious magnitude, to boot. the same kind of serious mistakes, if allowed to arise in the nuclear industry, could render much of the earth's surface uninhabitable.
