ok, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for buster keaton's silent classic "7 chances". comedy, or acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. here we have the stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. regardless of what the credits say on their films, real "stooge-philes" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. they took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. words spoken by emil sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. how many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? most obviously the seinfeld crew but none others that i've seen in the last 35 years of watching tv. the critics will always "pooh pooh" the stooges or laurel & hardy and others but then again...who ever remembers the critic's names or what they said? simply watch, laugh and enjoy!
