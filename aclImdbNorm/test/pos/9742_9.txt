one of the most famous of all movie serials! still interesting today although it does have an "old movie" look to it. the second serial looks better but simply does not equal this one. actors have a good time , especially middleton and lipson. great editing by the universal expert crew. the musical score was tracked in from universal's "destination unknown", "the invisible man", "the black cat", and "werewolf of london". and what great action music it was! if there was a choice for all-time best serial, this (arguably) should be #1.
