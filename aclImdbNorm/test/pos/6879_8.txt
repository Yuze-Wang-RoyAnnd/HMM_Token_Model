notorious hk catiii actor, anthony wong, is for once (well...not actually once - he was a cop in the daughter of darkness films and a few others...)not a psychopathic weirdo in erotic nightmare. usually recognized for his role as a complete wackadoo in such catiii "nasties" like the untold story and the ebola syndrome - this time, wong is on the receiving-end of the nastiness...<br /><br />wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams, for a price. true to his word, the dreams that wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin' hot schoolgirls - but the dreams come with a price that's more than money. the sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmails wong out of his cash and business, kills his family, and eventually kills wong himself...wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on, and eventually finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil sorcerer - but as it turns out - wong's brother is a pretty dope-ass sorcerer himself, and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife - turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes...<br /><br />erotic nightmare is one of the more enjoyable catiii films i've seen in a while. absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other catiii entries like red to kill, the untold story or human pork chop - erotic nightmare, though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter, is more "fun" then some of the more serious films of the genre. more comparable to eternal evil of asia - a more "carefree" catiii entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore, without being overly comedic either. definitely worth a look, especially to the genre enthusiast. 8/10
