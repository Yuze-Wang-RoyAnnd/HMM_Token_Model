i saw this movie, when it first came out. patty didn't want to be separated from her siblings. however the juvenile justice system don't care. when patty looked at the case file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention facility. he claimed she violated the rules of privacy, by looking at private files. she just wanted her family together. i couldn't blame her. the parents were not even fit parents. one of the smaller children had to have a restroom. the father stopped and let them off. he drove off him and left the children stranded, at the service station. patty had to take authority to protect them, since she was the oldest. they were placed in foster homes. the good part is that the social worker got them back as a family. the head social worker, kept telling him to butt out and not interfere. he was power crazy. he was the one, who had patty placed in the juvenile facility. why didn't they go after the father, who was released from prison, for abandonment. yet the children are caught in the middle and made to feel insecure.
