i think samuel goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film. first the film is a homage to jascha heifetz, considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century. secondly having brought to the screen the dead end kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with warner brothers, he was trying to create a second gang of appealing urchins. <br /><br />though the film was good there certainly was no demand that the kids from this film be reteamed for another feature. <br /><br />leader of the gang is gene reynolds who at one time played the violin, but now leads a street gang of disreputable urchins. his stepfather, arthur hohl, breaks the violin his late father gave young reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school over the feeble protests of his mother marjorie main.<br /><br />young reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music maestro himself, walter brennan and his daughter andrea leeds. they take him in, but they have their financial problems with a lot of creditors led by porter hall.<br /><br />this film is mostly to be seen today because it's a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear jascha heifetz who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybody's problems. joel mccrea is in this film also, but has a rather colorless part as andrea leeds boyfriend. <br /><br />besides heifetz, one thing the film does do is touch on, albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses. arthur hohl is one mean man and marjorie main is very clearly a much battered wife.<br /><br />the kids in the cast do well, reynolds, tommy kelly, terry kilburn and a young girl under the name of jacqueline nash who grew up and performed as gale sherwood, nightclub partner to nelson eddy. she had a nice soprano even as a child.<br /><br />but it's heifetz you see the show for.
