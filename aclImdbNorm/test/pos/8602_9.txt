i didn't really concentrate on the larger genocidal aspects of the story (although the horrific images at the beginning are very powerful). i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family. imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb ticking away inside you. i was really wrenching to see yasuko being rejected as "tainted" by the bomb. the image that stays with me most is when yasuko stands before the mirror combing her hair, silently watching it come out in clumps.
