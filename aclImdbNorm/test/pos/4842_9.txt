being relatively young, i didn't know how bad anti-semitism was in brooklyn, where my family is originally from. this movie absolutely horrified me. i've seen many movies about prejudice, racism, and anti-semitism, but this seemed to hit me harder than most.<br /><br />this was definitely one of the best indie films i've ever seen...i had to travel 45 minutes to see it, and it was well worth it. nearly everything about the movie was great. sometimes it was a little slow, but that didn't really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric. it took place in the 40s, and it really did look like it was the 40s. the acting was great...william h. macy as always was wonderful, so was laura dern, and i was pleasantly surprised by meatloaf's performance, playing the vicious anti-semite neighbor. <br /><br />9/10
