the film begins with a dowdy housewife (norma shearer) finding out that her husband (rod la rocque) had been cheating on her. three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. oddly, during this time, la rocque did not see shearer or his two kids as shearer took them to paris.<br /><br />marie dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved norma to come to her house for the weekend--ostensibly to help marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and la rocque! apparently, norma is now a super-vamp and with her magical sex appeal, she can break up the romance--and no one seems to realize that she and la rocque were married. several others are there for the weekend and immediately norma is a hit with her gay, carefree sexy ways--and almost all the men (including la rocque) are captivated by her. neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex- wants the new and improved norma back! this film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper-crust--similar in some ways to jean renoir's the rules of the game. oddly, despite the severity of the depression, such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them a bit too droll in spots. however, fortunately, in let us be gay, there are plenty of cute and funny moments (particularly towards the end when marie dressler shows her true colors). while not a great film, it certainly is a good one and more than just another time-passer. my only real regret is that i didn't love the very end. you'll just have to see it for yourself--perhaps you'll agree about the ending, perhaps you won't, but i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film.
