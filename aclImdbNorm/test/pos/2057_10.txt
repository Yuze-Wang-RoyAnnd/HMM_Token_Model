i am a happily married 49 year old female, who just happens to love this movie to death.<br /><br />geena davis' character is strong, smart and kick ass...............i thought she did an excellent (thats an understatement) job in this movie.<br /><br />i'm not real big on action movies, but i thought it was sooooooooooo sexy and entertaining.<br /><br />she is my alter-ego.............when she starts putting that assault rifle together in the old hotel room.....................i got chills...............she did it like she knew what she was doing............thats one of my many favorite parts in that movie........<br /><br />i think she deserved an oscar for her acting and physical roles........<br /><br />i'm going to have 'charly' tattoed on my back..............i'm one of those girls who will never be a victim......................i'm like her...............(shhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly........and isn't that oh so sexy?)
