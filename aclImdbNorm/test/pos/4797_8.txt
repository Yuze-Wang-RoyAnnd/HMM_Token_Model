when you look at mexico's best movies you will more than likely find that the photography was performed by gabriel figueroa. he is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed. his master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of. if added to his participation we add the direction of luis bunuel, you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. this story, nazarin, was written by spain's greatest writer besides miguel de cervantes(don quijote de la mancha). the story in itself is superb: nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very christian life, but as always there are people that do not accept this. he wanders through many places preaching his christianity but finding, most of the time, people that do not accept him. but besides the splendid story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver.
