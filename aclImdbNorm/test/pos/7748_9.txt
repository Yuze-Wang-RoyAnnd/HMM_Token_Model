i thought this movie was quite good. it was on tcm (turner classic movies) at three am one night, and its offbeat humor kept me up til five. kelly performs beautifully in this role, especially with the grandma (whose quip almost caused me to laugh out of my seat). the main actress was alright, but the father was able to keep his character isolated from the marriage conflict and kept the humor coming. if you like a good offbeat, older movie, i would recommend it. unlike the other comment, i do like gene kelly. he was the perfect leading actor for many of the early musicals and i think in this role, he oozes his charisma. one drawback is the dance scenes get a little long-winded, but if you can get through those, you're in the clear.
