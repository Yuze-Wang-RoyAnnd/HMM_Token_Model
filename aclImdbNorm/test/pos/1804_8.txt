valley girl is an exceptionally well made film with an all-around great cast. even though the dialogue is a bit dated now, when the movie was released it was very hip. to this day, i know many people (teenagers included) that cannot form a sentence without using the word "like". that is without a doubt the legacy this movie will leave. a rating of 8 was given for this, like, most excellent movie.
