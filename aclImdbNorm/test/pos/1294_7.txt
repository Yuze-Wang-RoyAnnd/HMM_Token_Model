a delightful story about two evacuees, has been turned into a nice little film, by the bbc. most children who like a good story will enjoy this. the characters are played really well by a very good cast. not sure whether our american friends will appreciate it, but they do get a mention, as aunty lou runs off with a gorgeous american soldier.
