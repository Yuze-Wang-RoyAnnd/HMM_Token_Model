early 80's creature feature concerns a long abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to check out. naturally, they find no gold down there but one very hungry monster that slithers along in search of prey.<br /><br />while i have to be honest and admit i found it dull at first (i personally prefer the thematically similar "the boogens"), it actually grew on me as it went along. now, the characters aren't too interesting nor the actors either. the closest to an interesting character is morgan, played by keith hurt. in any event, female lead terri berland is quite good looking and rolf theison makes his domineering jerk an easy person to hate. the writer played by effects man mark sawicki wears thin quickly.<br /><br />it begins in a comfortably predictable enough way, with a nighttime set piece in which two victims are claimed to get things off to an acceptable start. the monster itself is intriguing for its design (as you can imagine, it gets revealed a bit at a time until late in the game) and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used very much. director melanie anne phillips (directing under the pseudonym of david michael hillman) and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere. they manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy, and their use of lighting works well. the film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending. suffice it to say, they do the best they can on their low budget.<br /><br />an obscure little item worth looking into for die-hard horror buffs.<br /><br />7/10
