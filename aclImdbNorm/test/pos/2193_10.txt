i viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. i found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. george hearn, of course,was the master of the role of sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. angela lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as mrs. lovett. she understood that sondheim wanted that role to be something of a "comic" counterpart to sweeney; and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of sweeney and her nurture of the boy tobias. for those with long memories, this performance takes one back to her debut performances in the picture of dorian grey and gaslight; long before murder, she wrote. only a year ago i saw the musical at lyric opera of chicago. with current opera superstar brynn terfel as sweeney. others have commented on the operatic quality of the score. my conclusion is that "sweeney" works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines, than with opera performers who have limited acting skills. as a final note, i commend the performer who portrayed tobias. with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what is going on around him. it seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word.
