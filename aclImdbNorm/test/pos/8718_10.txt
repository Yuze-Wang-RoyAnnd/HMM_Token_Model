i was lucky enough recently to see ingrid bergman's name attached to a film i had never seen (or even heard of) on amc. what a stroke of luck.<br /><br />to marvel at her flawless and seamless performance isn't the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie. the writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent.<br /><br />walter mathau (not my favorite) was nearly perfect and goldie hawn (suprisingly) was fabulous. tender at times, demanding, then just plain goofy. there are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will get caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie.<br /><br />that bergman can steal a dance scene among a crowd of 20 year-olds was amazing to watch. she is effortless in her return to the screen (at age 54?). the supporting cast was great and the lines... the lines are exquisite.<br /><br />a top 5 romantic comedy of all time.
