this is an excellent james bond movie. although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is a standalone film, it is very well done. enticing sean connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play bond again. connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. the script is outstanding, as are the photography and the performances. it's the earliest movie i recall with kim basinger, who became much more famous after this film; barbara carrera was excellent; and klaus maria brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. the frequent references to the aging of bond and the changing times and attitudes of the british secret service were most humorous. the 007 gadgets equaled those of the other bond films. the only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. it was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent james bond movies released in the same year, this one and octopussy with roger moore. an interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. the early 80's were the first heyday of such things, and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie. the film is actually a different version of thunderball, updated with newer technology. regardless of the repeated theme, there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining. i will watch this one frequently.
