i really liked this film about love between two adults in postwar britain. the high standards of bbc tv is evident in the production, and superb lead actors (claire bloom and joss ackland) make this an uplifting experience. bloom and ackland have previously worked together in theatre, and their chemistry and interaction is splendid. i recommend this version of shadowlands over the film version of 1993.
