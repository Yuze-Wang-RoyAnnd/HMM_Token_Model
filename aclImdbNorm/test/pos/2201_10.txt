i own a copy of this film and have always loved it. i comment here, however, because i saw the pbs presentation of a concert version of sweeney todd earlier this week. that production was put on by the san francisco opera and starred george hearn and patti lupone. in the early '80s hearn replaced len cariou as sweeney (cariou had won the tony for his performance). i saw hearn and angela lansbury (who also won the tony for her performance as mrs. lovett) perform sweeney on broadway. they must have made the film at about the time i saw the show. to this day, the most moving moment i can ever remember in the theatre occurred when hearn sang "these are my friends." ("these are my friends, see how they glisten." "my arm is complete again!") <br /><br />hearn's performance in the san francisco opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since i first saw him perform the piece on broadway and later in the film. what a talent! he is sympathetic, funny, and scary -- all at once; and he can sing, boy can he sing. all of this reminded me of how terrific the film is. highly recommended. ten out of ten.
