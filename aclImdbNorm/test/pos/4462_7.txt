in a small, picturesque sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young, sexually curious boys. the local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects, including voyeuristic village retard giuseppe (vito passeri) and an elusive, grungy, voodoo doll-poking backwoods witch named maciara (florinda bolkan). there's also don alberto (marc popel), a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school, andrea (tomas milian), a journalist helping to aid the police, and the beautiful patrizia (barbara bouchet), a gorgeous, but seriously screwed-up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very (i mean, very) young boys. as typical with the giallo subgenre, the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames, but if you can hang in there long enough, this film pays off. the script (written by fulci, gianfranco clerici and roberto gianviti) keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work, cinematography (by sergio d'offizi) and musical score (by riz ortolani). the acting, particularly bolkan, is also very good. fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s grotesqueries like the beyond and zombie will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate, but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery (bizarrely, yet effectively, set to singer ornella vanoni's ballad "quei giorni insieme a te") and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film the psychic (1977). scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen (except for a brief strangulation), but the camera doesn't hesitate to linger on their corpses. the film was not released theatrically in america and, presumably because of some anti-catholic elements in the storyline, received only a limited theatrical release in europe.
