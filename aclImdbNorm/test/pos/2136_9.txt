i only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago, yet it's impact has never left me and i can still remember even now my reactions to it.i was mesmerised by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography. i was astounded that an american studio could produce such a european film with it's slow pace and its unfocused plot. the lack of any strong characters felt like a flaw but i raged at the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht which seemed as though it was bolted on to give some kind of plot cohesion and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the picture.it was also refreshing to see a western which made no pretence about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate detritus of the american dream.the western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which prefigured the recent deadwood series.the film was massively cut for the american audience and its my very real wish that in these days of director's cuts that michael cimino is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection - a cut which could turn this ill fated movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become. i have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes so much more sense,although christopher walken is responsible mainly for carrying this off. if only de niro and not kris kristofferson had played the main lead!there was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. nevertheless, the camera work was so cleverly handled that at times you could almost believe you were inside the action yourself.and there were many special moments. everybody arguing in the hall in different languages trying to overcome their national differences and seek some unity of action in face of the impending disaster gave a real insight into the difficulties facing the welding together of the usa: especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money.nate's faltering approach to ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another one. i had a special showing with a large group of mates to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it whilst having varying reservations.this revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for americans to take when the film was first released but we all felt it had enormous merit and that its place in cinema history was also due for major revision
