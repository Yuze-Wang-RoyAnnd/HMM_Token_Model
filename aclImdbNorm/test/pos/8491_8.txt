jamie foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues/soul/country singer ray charles. to the film's credit, it shows both the good and the bad regarding charles' character and the choices he made, both personally and professionally.<br /><br />this is a slick-looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place. not only does it look good, it sounds good. i only wish there was more music in here. when it's inserted, it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it. <br /><br />assuming, at least for review purposes, that the story was true, i was impressed and disappointed with charles, meaning the story left some memorable impressions since i'm writing this 16 months after viewing it. main impressions include:<br /><br />good - re-living ray's immense talent and his foresight to step out and take chances musically, such as going "country" for awhile. the man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it. also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction - with no help! that's just amazing.<br /><br />bad - i also remember through this film how easily hooked ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so unfaithful to his wife. a really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kid's little league games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her, even fathering a child with a member of his singing group.<br /><br />the only negative i had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event, the accidental death of his brother. that tragedy was used as cop-out for all ray's misdoings as an adult, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions.<br /><br />note: there is an extended version with the dvd but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching, so stick with the "theatrical version."
