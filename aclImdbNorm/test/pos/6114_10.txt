well, i can safely say i'm human, wong. and i didn't throw up. i laughed. and laughed. if this movie made you puke, there is something wrong with you. but this movie is incredible. i bought it four days ago, and have watched it 5 times already. the animal cruelty gets my heart, but not long enough to be guilty. the movie is shocking, disgusting, and vulgar. the acting is horrific. what else do you want from a movie? i am a die-hard cult film maniac. pink flamingos is awesome. it makes rocky horror, as someone has said, look like the teletubbies.
