just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on dvd until the last few years. since then, it has become available, but initially only in the british format (for which i bought an 'international' dvd player, which you have to hack--illegally, i suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on dvd in the us format, no hacking. there were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. this mini-series is one of the very best on oppenheimer, or the manhattan project, or virtually anything produced by the bbc.
