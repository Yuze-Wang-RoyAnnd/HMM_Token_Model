i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many, many years now so it didn't surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here. but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done. i don't know whether i "buy into" kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. i took notice of her in the first mission impossible. although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.<br /><br />here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash. they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. apparently ford, a police detective in wash d.c., discovers that his wife was having an affair. he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswoman.<br /><br />the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, the uncovering of deceipt, and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.<br /><br />i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable.
