i have found this show by accident and was surprised to find out that nobody i know has ever heard of it. this was by far one of the best shows i have seen in months if not years and i cannot wait for more episodes to come out. sleeper cell portrays a psychological struggle of an undercover agent inside of a terrorist cell who has to constantly make difficult decisions in order to maintain his cover while staying true to his real cause. this is an extremely well done show. it keeps you intrigued from the first episode till the end and though progressing slowly, is fast enough for you to feel on the edge. quite realistic and humane, it touches on important topics and every episode presents an interesting question to ponder about. this show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on tv and is not trying to be anything either. it is genuine and unique. it is a show about a human being, his difficult choices and his life of struggle where a simple mistake can cost him everything.<br /><br />i gave this show a 10 for great storyline, good progression, excellent cinematography, excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell.
