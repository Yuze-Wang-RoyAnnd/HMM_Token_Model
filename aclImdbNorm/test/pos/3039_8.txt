i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight (midnight cowboy, coming home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.<br /><br />despite incredible odds, pat conroy (voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. his methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like mr. skeffington (hume cronyn), but teachers like conroy will always be winners.<br /><br />voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him. he didn't overplay the role, and i found him to be totally believable. voight is conrack.<br /><br />besides a love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. no matter how good you are at your job, if you rock the boat, the bureaucrats will get you.
