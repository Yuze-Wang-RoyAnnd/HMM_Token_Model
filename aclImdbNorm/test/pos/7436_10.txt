it really isn't hard to understand this movie! i watched it with no expectations and no knowledge of the story from the games. i was completely blown away!<br /><br />initially, i wondered how most of the characters have some sort of super-powers but it is called "final fantasy...". i also wondered about cloud's past but that was easy enough to look up. in no way did these questions spoil the enjoyment of the movie, though. just the opposite; it shows i kept thinking about the story long after seeing the movie.<br /><br />it's one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen. the music supports the movie completely. the characters are incredible. <br /><br />i want more!
