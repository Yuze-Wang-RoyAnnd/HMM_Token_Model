this is a great italian shark movie probably not a full action type of shark movie but it has a great story about a native american in the form of a killer shark that attacks a small beach community. the movie has actual scenes of real sharks and some not but how they made it is pretty good the cast are not that brilliant of acting in this shark film but it it shows better acting in some other italian shark movies such as (e.g cruel jaws,last shark)they show some pretty bad acting but most italian shark movies are good which means this votes best as the best italian shark movie ever , some scenes in this movie show violence/gore which makes this film good that it shows it so i would say this is the best film for all shark-movie-fans.
