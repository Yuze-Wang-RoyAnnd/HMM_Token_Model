carly jones (elisha curtberth), her bad boy brother nick (chad michael murray), her boyfriend wade (jared padalecki), and her friends paige (paris hilton) and her boyfriend blake (robert richard) and dalton (jon abrahams) travel to another city to watch an important game. they decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey on the next day. however, the fan belt of wade's car breaks and he stays with carly to buy a new one in a close town, where there is a house of wax. when they arrive in the place, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two deranged former siamese brothers have transformed people in wax statues.<br /><br />i liked this "house of wax", indeed a worthwhile teen horror movie. the story follows the standards of "the texas chainsaw massacre" and other slash movies, and it is well made, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the death scenes are amazing. even if the movie were not good, watching the sexy and delicious paris hilton is worth. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "a casa de cera" ("the house of wax")
