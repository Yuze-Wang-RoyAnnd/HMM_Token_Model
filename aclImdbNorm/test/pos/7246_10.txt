i give this a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to uncover because it wasn't... but because it leaves one caring for the characters. the acting, by all the cast, is superb, especially joan hickson, and it's a marvellous episode because of it's heart. <br /><br />miss marple is called upon by jason rafiel's dying request to investigate, and solve, a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously, and she has to discover who, why and when as she goes along. mr rafiel is the same rafiel as was in a caribbean mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here. <br /><br />nemesis is definitely one for the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood, guts and rip-roaring action sequences, then you won't like it. but if you are like me, one who loves knowing about people and discovering what makes them tick, then nemesis is the one for you.
