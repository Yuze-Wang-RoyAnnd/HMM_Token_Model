this film is too good for words. its so unbelievably great and funny and true to life. you just know from watching this that the person who wrote this has defiantly felt the way that jip and his friends do through the film. it was my life at one point and i would rely on coming home to watch human traffic ever night before i could even think of going to bed. i think you just get so loved up with the characters and their life style. of course, this film wouldn't be for old people more around the age of 16 to 22 i guess. there is defiantly nothing wrong with this film and it will have you in stitches all the way through. it doesn't have a particular story line to it. the general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in london and what they get up to. the places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. you have to get this movie on dvd never mind just watching it, you have to have it!!!
