i enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording/mixing.<br /><br />for whatever reason, they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called adr, where the actors replace the original location sound with a re-recording of it in a sound booth.<br /><br />the reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain.<br /><br />it wouldn't be so bad if the adr was done well, but at times it's just plain distracting. it's not just the adr that's the problem - the sound mix just doesn't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures.<br /><br />i'd be curious to know what went wrong.
