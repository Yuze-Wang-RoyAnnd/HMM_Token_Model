this hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever, and i certainly won't argue with that. even in a country where top-notch animated shorts are created with regularity, this film still manages to stand out. if you ever get the chance to view this film, please do so. it's only ten minutes long, and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws, a woman who vacuums the bathtub, and a nuclear war. what more could you want in a film?
