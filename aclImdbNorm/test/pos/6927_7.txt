a ham actor without a penny. who better than michael caine to play such a character? he is totally and utterly hilarious but, as in most of caine's performances, he goes for it for real. the film seems to be a showcase of dylan moran and he's splendiferous in his double act with caine. this, however, is where the script falters. moran's impersonations should have been incorporated in a rather more organic way. they are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window. never mind. get it if you can find it. there is enough in it to make it a pleasurable journey.
