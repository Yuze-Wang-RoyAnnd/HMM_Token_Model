this is the first pepe le pew cartoon and in some ways it's very similar to the later ones but in a few other odd ways it is not. while the object of pepe's affections is a cat, oddly it appears to be a boy cat! this whole predicament occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone. unfortunately, this attracts our hero, pepe. most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected ending--and this actually makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series. excellent animation (though the style is different than later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this one a keeper.
