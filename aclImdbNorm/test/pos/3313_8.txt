this 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. this follows the same idea as three coins in a fountain a few years before. this takes place in new york while coins takes place in rome, italy. our three beauties are hope lange, in her first starring role, suzy parker and diane baker. lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely joan crawford. suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau. hard to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason, but louis jourdan, her heart throb, does just this. sort of takes you back to paul neuman rejecting the gorgeous elizabth taylor in cat on a hot tin roof, doesn't it? diane baker, the third damsel in distress, meets and dates robert evans, before he became the producer, and husband to ali macgraw, he is known for. hope's boyfriend from home, played by newcomer brett halsey, is promising to marry her. she also meets stephen boyd, a fellow worker, who has interests in our hope. all three ladies have their drama ahead of them. crawford almost steals the film. her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch. veteran actor brian aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching our leading ladies' back side. he's delightfully charming. also in the cast is martha hyer, wasted in a thankless role never really explored. too bad as i like this actress who never seems to get that one role to distinguish her abilities. she has a crush on a married man in the office played by donald harron, whom i had the pleasure to work with in a couple of shakespeare plays in nyc. he is a distinguished actor that is wasted in this film also.<br /><br />all in all it's great fun, in technicolor and cinemascope, directed by jean negulesco.
