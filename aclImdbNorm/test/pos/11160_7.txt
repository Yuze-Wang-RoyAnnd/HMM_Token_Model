it's not hard to imagine what the main problem for a screenwriter is who wants to have 18 equally well written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that last around 90 minutes. it's almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes and that is also what writer-director ralf westhoff does here. very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and me know in real life, many of them are just characterized with two or three attributes and stay vague. i am aware of that but still think that "shoppen" is successful, namely that it accomplishes just what it wants to. it is a film with very well written dialogue, extremely good acting and a film that made me laugh out loud really often. i don't think that this film wants to make a deep going analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be moral commentary on speed-dating. it's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it. funny and entertaining.
