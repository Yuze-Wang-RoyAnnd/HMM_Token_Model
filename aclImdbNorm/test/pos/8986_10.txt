i caught this a few times on tv in the late 1970s. it only played late at night (past midnight).<br /><br />peter lorre plays a kind, happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. he is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and filled with despair. he turns to a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful. he makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (evelyn keyes)...who is blind! he tries to go straight for her...but he can't escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own scarred face.<br /><br />a no budget b film. very short (runs only a little over an hour) but well made and superbly acted by lorre. this has a lot more depth than you would expect from a quickie b picture. ankers especially takes the thankless "girl" role and makes her character fresh and appealing. this has sadly disappeared from tv and was never put on video or dvd (as far as i know). tcm did show it recently and it was great to see the movie still holds up.<br /><br />highly recommended.
