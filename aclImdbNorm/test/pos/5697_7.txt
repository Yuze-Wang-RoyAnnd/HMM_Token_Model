<br /><br />as i am a teenager, i have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on. i try to see a mixture of classics, mainstream, art-house, and other movies. the 70's is one of the most important decades for films: it's when the average, common, classical films changed into full of messages and anti-social behavior. it became like nothing anyone had ever seen before. what a decade under the influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around the graduate to about star wars.<br /><br />richard lagravenese and the late ted demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary, which interviews such people as dennis hopper, francis ford coppola, martin scorsese, robert altman, and jon voight, among others about how those few years changed cinema forever. it's a very professional, polished documentary, and it's even financed by ifc films. however, as this is a very professional one, i would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing. to me, that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing was.<br /><br />on the other hand, it's a very interesting documentary, about film by the people who make it. of course, they aren't bashing their own films or anything of the like, but they're portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant. i don't know much about film (but i want to be involved around it when i become an adult), so i feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset. i have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned, like chinatown and one flew over the cuckoo's nest, but a little more insight into those movies were very informative.<br /><br />the main reason, however, i didn't love influence is, as slickly as it was edited, it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed, therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show. they crammed in star wars and jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. it seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips, and that's fine, but some of them were unimportant, such as an extended one from network.<br /><br />overall, though, influence is a very enthralling, informative documentary that helped me, at least, learn more about a second `golden age' in american cinema.<br /><br />my rating: 7/10<br /><br />rated r for language, and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
