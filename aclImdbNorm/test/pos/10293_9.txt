when i watched l'appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "how complicated!" and she is right, of course. when you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero vs crook schemes, l'appartement is hard to follow. a couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points. other whine about the confusing flash backs. come on! this is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. this one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. the director has left more than enough clues in all scenes.<br /><br />the first 3/4 of the movie centers about the question: why did max and lisa split? the film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. having experience with french movies, i predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and i was right. in the end of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that max and lisa were manipulated by alice. max did not know, that lisa had left and why. lisa did not know, why max did not contact her in rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to paris. the only one who did was alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut.<br /><br />after both max and lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can alice's manipulations be undone? well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed.<br /><br />many european movies use a story telling technique i fully enjoy. there is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. l'appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. in the first half alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure.<br /><br />acting is simply great. vincent cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. monica belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. jean paul ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. romane bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret.<br /><br />the only reason i did not gave it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfying end. of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. after all the events max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. alice has paid for her sins. but still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. max too easily exchanges lisa for alice; alice too easily decides to reject max, who has been her dream for so long; max too easily returns to his fianc'ee. but then again, i don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. i guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.
