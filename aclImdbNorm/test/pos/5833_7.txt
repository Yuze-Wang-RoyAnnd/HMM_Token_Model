hi to read the entire plot around "oz" just look at imdb here to find it.<br /><br />**warning spoilers inside this review !** oz is the a series that has not only moved me but also shows a small bit. of the american prison system, but i have to say (judging on discovery channels program over jail) it is not really realistic.<br /><br />although i got to say, there not shy, rapes,shanking (stabbing) happens allot. still it is television, so for you ppl out there that think this is realistic wrong.<br /><br />there is a good degree of violence in it, and some here and there overdone scenes (plot over plot over plot) that can get pretty boring. but remember the series is almost ancient by now. so times do change as well i believe i should judge this in the time line as it came out.<br /><br />as the season prolonged up to season 5 it was pretty good!. until one of the cons wins a lottery ticket of 2 million dollars, because he talked to god it struck me as "ok this is getting to the point i do not want to see this series no more" still i proceeded! and now i just seen the episode 3 of season 6. this is were cereal gets his brain zapped and then his "mom" hold him after, while he is drooling. then you see o reilly cry as well seeing his bro like that (rl brothers as well) now thats by far the best scene out of the entire "oz" series, that was real to me! still do not read this wrong that i'm trying to crash and burn it. it is a really good series! and even now 2010 well worth a watch ! i give it a 7 because of the storyline that weakens with the season. but still a golden glove.
