okay okay, i must admit, i do somewhat like peter liapis and i'll admit this is not the best ghoulies sequel. i mean, yeah, it had its flaws, such as no ghoulies themselves. but the two ghoulies that come to earth were really funny, i guess they were called, dark and lite. i enjoyed the plot of the movie. and even at the end of the movie both ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel. still waiting. lol. peter liapis reprised his role as jonathan graves, this time playing a detective, how cute! ghoulies iv may not be scary or suspenseful, but it is definitely funny. i thought i would comment on this movie and just say -- it's not that bad. it is worth watching even though the ghoulies aren't in it.
