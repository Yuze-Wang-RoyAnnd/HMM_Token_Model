although credit should have been given to dr. seuess for stealing the story-line of "horton hatches the egg", this was a fine film. it touched both the emotions and the intellect. due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old justin henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each one's predicament), the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over. overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent directing, and a very powerful script. the right touches of humor throughout help keep a "heavy" subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through. lastly, this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated, decades after it was released.
