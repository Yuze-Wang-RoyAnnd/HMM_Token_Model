good movie, great story, great characters, i enjoyed it immensely, enough to buy the dvd when it came out. <br /><br />the real life story it purports to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the fictionalizers could ever come up with. my friend who is in the media business said they shouldn't show insider dealings like this, it gives the business a bad name. as if.<br /><br />there are a few problems with the dvd though: first, the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the tv volume to watch it. i notice that its also like that when hbo runs it so its in the original production copy. second, for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off, that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side. after the five minutes it fills the screen properly, left to right. sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and i don't know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slide by.<br /><br />still, even with the technical flaws, its an enjoyable story, one of hbo's best i think.
