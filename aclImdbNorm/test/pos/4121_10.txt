this is at least very close to a perfect video publication. messianic metal group, dinosaurs of rock n' roll, biggest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and reminisces band's past - what more do we need?<br /><br />video starts from "war pigs" and ends to "paranoid" and in the middle all the greatest and most significant classics of the original line-up are included: "electric funeral", "sweet leaf", "after forever", "iron man", "children of the grave"...and of course my personal favourite "into the void", i'm glad they didn't leave it out. well, how could they?<br /><br />still, this video is more than just the music. ozzy osbourne, tony iommi, geezer butler and bill ward goes over the group's colorful history. only thing that slightly bothers me is when a live song is being interrupted with bits of interview. for example, is it that necessary to inform how the song "n.i.b." got it's name, right in the middle of it - one on top of the other? i doubt. it's still a small flaw so it's not too big deal.<br /><br />band members also laze around in chairs and chat together: pleasant material for a sabbath fan! i admit i have difficulties of following what ozzy osbourne is muttering but it's just amusing. i had a privilege to participate when "the last supper tour" entered finland and for me personally this video is an ideal way to recall that magnificent show.
