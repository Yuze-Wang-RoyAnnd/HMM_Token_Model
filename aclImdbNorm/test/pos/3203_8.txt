the killing yard is a great film, although uneven at times. morris chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of alan alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. the emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's "flashback" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. i was not even born when the attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, i find that "the killing yard" does the story all of it's fair justices. i would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool.
