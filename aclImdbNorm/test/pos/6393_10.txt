if you take the huxtable parents and blend them with the kyle parents you get a perfect blend of over the top and under the edge parenting that you can wish for your own family child-rearing skills. the best part about each show is that the parents do not come off as pompous self-righteous upper class know it alls but at the same time they are not the stereotypical under-educated parents who are constantly being bamboozled and disrespected by their children. my kids are 20, 16 and 6; just about the same ages as the kyle kids and i see so much of their situations mirroring my own experiences with my family. the silliness that they indulge in only goes to show that when you have love in your family you do not have to take yourself too seriously to keep your household together and have fun with your kids.
