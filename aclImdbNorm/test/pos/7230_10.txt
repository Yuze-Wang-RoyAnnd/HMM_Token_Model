tromeo & juliet - 10th anniversary edition<br /><br />william shakespeare's play romeo & juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films. sometimes literally following the original text (which is, at times, vague in stage directions), sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece. some are good, many are mediocre. lloyd kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original, modern versions of the bard's creation, it may be placed in a modern-day decaying new york and full of the modern-day anti-social behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and kinky sex (which, for the more than casual reader, shakespeare himself wasn't shying away from), but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about, which is quite an effort. kaufman wrote the script with his co-director on the film james gunn, who is now famous for writing two successful scooby doo movies, doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for dawn of the dead and directing one of the best horror-films of the year: slither. lloyd kaufmans innovative directorial view alongside with james gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of shakespeare's play that maybe not everyone will "get" immediately, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play. with a script that is written entirely in iambic meter, appearances of motorhead's lemmy and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching tromeo & juliet is something no one will ever forget. apart from it's historical significance, tromeo & juliet is a treasure for film-lovers of all kind. not only for the script by james gunn, now a good influence on hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it features an early part of legendary actress debbie rochon. well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets. the 10th anniversary edition on dvd adds to all that by including so many as-yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the dvd, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days. in many ways the extra's on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on kaufman's film-school "make your own damn movie". furtermore historical items from the troma vaults which include james gunn, debbie rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included, and the film itself is, apart from looking better then ever, accompanied by no less than four audio-commentaries, each and everyone informative, excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days. there are new commentaries (one with kaufman and gunn together), but also the one james gunn did for the original release of the dvd but couldn't be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc. with fan-recreations of a few of the scenes from the film, a video diary of lloyd kaufman's visit to the set of james gunn's slither and a visit the two brought together to eli roth's hostel birthday party and much more, this is the ultimate set everyone must own. weather you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of the great bard's work, a fan of great cinema, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of james gunn, interested in learning more on making films on a low budget, a fan of lloyd kaufman or whatever: this is the most important dvd-release of this millennium!
