what a cast of actors and actresses in this columbo episode, beside peter falk, you have julie newmar, jeannette nolan, martin landau as twins. anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fianc'e, julie newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. jeannette nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. martin landau plays identical twins in this one. each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money. well, you'll just have to watch and see the outcome but i can assure you that it's always worth watching this one for the cast and the crew.
