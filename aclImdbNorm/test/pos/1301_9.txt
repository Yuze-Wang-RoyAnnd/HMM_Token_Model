i watched this because a friend told me it was damn good, and i watched a video on it, so i was really into watching it. i watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are really good. if the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. there isn't as much fighting as i would like, i have to say, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. they don't show much, but you can tell it's violent and cool. but there's also the plot, that goes around a love triangle between the main characters, though it's a bit twisted. tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble, as well as fights. he's the leader of his school, and is the rival of hea-won, who's the leader of his own school - a bit of a playboy, hot-headed and a rich boy. then there's han-kyung, a girl with not a lot going for her - her father just passed away and she moved back with her mother, the guy she liked is dating her old friend -, and then she meets hea-won, who goes to her school, and tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). eventually, she discovers tae-sung is her brother, fruit of one of her father's affair, and he loves her despite of their blood relation. meanwhile, hea-won falls for her, and takes her as his boyfriend. but she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses her love to her. overall, it's a wonderful movie, but if i was really depressed after the end, and i just couldn't help but think, damn, are all korean movie i watch about fighting/death/depressing stuff/incest?? 'cause that sure was the case with old boy, and temptation of wolves. it's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry at the end.
