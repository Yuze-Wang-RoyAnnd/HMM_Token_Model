aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest marguerite moreau.<br /><br />i would have loved to see this movie play out as akasha's power trip. aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen. she does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of 10. watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold.<br /><br />lena olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "the older woman", which is hugely unjustified. she looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the imdb) still looks stunning.<br /><br />the story unfortunately is very limited plot wise, we've seen it all before, etc.<br /><br />the most heart wrenching is akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to aaliyah after filming.<br /><br />all in all, a remarkable vampire movie.
