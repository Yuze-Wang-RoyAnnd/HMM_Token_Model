this program was quite interesting. the way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting. string theory is also very interesting to listen too. the whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it. i enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the physicists. extra dimensions really boggle the mind. if you have the chance, watch this amazing documentary.
