when taken as a whole for its ideas and dissection of the current 2-party system and political process, i think this is a great film. granted the movie was not the comedy i expected, but once i got over that this film really made me think. so much of what we see and hear in regards to any election is such a joke. there is in particular a debate scene in this movie that i felt was a masterful critique of our political debates and how policies are "discussed" at them. i encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this film. if you want something to laugh at however, robin williams and christopher walken are not their usual selves. in this movie they show us that the truth hurts, not that the truth is funny.
