the story takes place on the streets of sao paoulo in brazil where a young boy named pixote grows up alone without his parents. left troubled and with no direction, pixote gets taken into a child asylum with other adolescents from the street. behind closed doors terrible things occurs within the staff and within the child-groups. and there is one last trigger that gets the place blown up, the last incident that makes pixote and his friends decide to break out and escape. from there on begins a journey overwhelmed with strong bonded friendships, friendships torn apart, love and hate, criminal activities and simply chilling on the beach talking about things, something someone like you and i also does sometimes.<br /><br />i think this film is perfect in so many ways because it touches you on so many levels, it did that with me anyway. the document-like style used to portray pixote and his surroundings does it seem more realistic, and the actors, who really are street children and have lived similar lives, helps the humanity in the conditions seem more natural. it has a social comment about child abuse too, but i think what makes the film so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political views. the last scene, which i find the best piece from the film, strikes me as something beyond nothing i've seen before. so full of emotions and yet so unsentimental makes this film a truthful, believable, unbearable, unforgettable story-tale. a true heartbreaking masterpiece which is so underrated!<br /><br />my vote: 10/10
