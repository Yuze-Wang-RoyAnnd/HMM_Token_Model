there is an interesting split in the voting for this movie (at the moment at least). those who go expecting a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed. i anticipate that those giving the film 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a re-enaction of the invasion of gallipoli.<br /><br />so - if you want to see actors, gunfire and gore, this film will not suit you. if you want to see an independent documentary about gallipoli, without bias towards any one side (the only enemy in these events was the war itself) then you'll come away both impressed and sobered. i found it a very moving film, and even quite liked captain guy nightingale by the end.
