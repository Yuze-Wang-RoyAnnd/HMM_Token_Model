... sings david bovie in this movie. but it is!!! it's all about america, so don't be ashamed to watch it. just think, if you can, to prevent more damage... you know, you're just the same regular guy next door, so, be careful! one of the best critics of "common" mind and friendship. still don't care? go for it for the music - it's worth a try, just close your eyes and pat metheny and david bowie will touch you so deep you'll start to scream! and while watching, if you'll dare to open your eyes, please don't do the popcorn&stuff, you're gonna miss quite a lot. you may think that it's not worth, but, think twice - and don't look at your neighbours lawn - you never know what to find there... is it worth? try it! just don't die or gloat over it...
