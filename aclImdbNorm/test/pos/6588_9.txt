this film came as a gift - a late-night offering out of the blue - so unlike other reviewers i had no preconceptions whatsoever. i found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own unfolding. i was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as i willed for "good" to prevail - but also forced to wryly acknowledge that sometimes i was on the side of the "bad" guys. the film is quite quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and this more than because the film begins and ends in an elegy. far from being depressing or confronting, to me, the film acknowledges deep suffering - and then, by its cyclic nature - with the births and re-births as well as the deaths - the film celebrates the fact that to quote an aussie poet, there is "sometimes gladness." oh gods, i feel as tho i've just written a love letter to this film - but there it is. hola!
