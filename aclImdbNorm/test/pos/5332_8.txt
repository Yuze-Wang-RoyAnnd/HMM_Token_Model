simply delightful claymation feature from nick park and company spoofing such film-greats as "king kong" and "the wolf man" has wallace and gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village..a giant were-rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens! what makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize. what makes the situation even worse is wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable-eating rampage..he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops. what occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were-rabbit is created in the process..and it has more to do with wallace than he could ever imagine. it'll be up to his loyal(..and startlingly intelligent)and fast-thinking dog gromit to save the day.<br /><br />this is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other oscar winning claymation features starring wallace and gromit. seeing good ole-fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the cgi boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product. here, we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation, not to mention gut-busting sight gags.
