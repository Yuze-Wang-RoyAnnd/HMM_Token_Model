"snow queen" is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) andersen's fairy tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one retains the spirit of faerie, an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many, especially among americans. talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons, and demons, are not to be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural an element of faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story. nor is the story bound by modern hollywood rules of composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least).<br /><br />with this defence against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales, "snow queen" is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting, and great sentiment. the only flaw in the movie was, i think, not that it was too fantastical but that certain parts of the dialogue were too glaringly modern in slang and expression, a mar on its otherwise timeless nature.
