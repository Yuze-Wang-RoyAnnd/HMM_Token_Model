sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult. this movie tells several stories so well simultaneously that it was the first few times a movie i could not watch to completion. it was too real....and the characters so strong that watching it became a personal struggle. seeing these three men and their families deal with their hardships, one in particular, often hit me too hard. now, i have watched in its entirety without interruption several times, and i realize what i always suspected. this movie is a masterpiece. the writing, the acting, the blending of several stories without being even the least bit choppy, everything about this movie is exceptional. seven academy awards? no wonder, it certainly must have deserved them.
