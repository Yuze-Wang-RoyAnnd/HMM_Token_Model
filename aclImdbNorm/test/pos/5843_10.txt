oz was a fantastic show, as long as frequent male nudity doesn't turn you off. there was way too much frontal male nudity in this show, more than any other show you'd see on a porn channel. minus that, it was the best show on tv, and a previous commenter said "better than prime suspect". prime suspect is tom and jerry vs the simpsons. no contest. if you have directv they are now re-running it from the start on channel 101, they're at episode #3 now. highly recommended. the creator tom fontana also did homicide, which was an awesome show. but why all the male nudity? we all know that stuff happens in prison, but did they really need to show it as often? that was the only thing that turned me off the show. if i want to see naked men, guys getting raped, i'll kill someone myself and witness first hand. otherwise i like my tv shows free of black penises every five minutes.
