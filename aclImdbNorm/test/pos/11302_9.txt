for a kid's movie, this is great. as an adult and mother, i enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. there is a lot going on in this movie. the following *might* be considered a *spoiler*... barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie. she also learns not to give up hope and to master her anger. i loved the sense of teamwork you get from watching barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. there's nothing in the movie i found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. in fact, i felt that the moral messages of the movie were superb and well done.<br /><br />the animation was pretty good. i really enjoy the ice-skating scenes and think that they were very well done. there's a lot of action in this film, so i suspect that most kids would enjoy it... not just the ones that are really into barbie. my daughter actually picked it out because of the pegasus. she loves horses. but she enjoyed the movie very much. my daughter is autistic, and was able to sit through the whole movie and enjoy it. she really liked the action scenes and any parts with horses involved.<br /><br />one thing that i was thinking about was that many people object to barbie (and ken) because they are so beautiful. yet, i think that kids, just like adults like to look at beautiful people and things. it's natural. as adults, we enjoy watching beautiful movie stars too. it's wonderful though, that the barbie character and her "boyfriend" have a lot of personality. while it's fun to watch pretty people, it grows old if there is no substance behind the pretty face.<br /><br />overall, i'd say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it, too. :)
