as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. i for one think that is a good sign. <br /><br />i always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (i never watched titanic for instance, and am not planning to).<br /><br />the english patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are 'home' (katherine), it shows how destructive love can be in a slow, strong and utterly painful way, it excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the one(s) who leave behind, how pointless one can feel to move on. <br /><br />the photography is just stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. the pace is slow, but timely, and that does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth/development of the characters. to put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multi-layeredness of this movie. people tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies... as if they are in a rush to get to work.. hey - get a life ! ;-) enjoy...<br /><br />i give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
