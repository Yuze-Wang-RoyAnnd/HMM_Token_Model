i know this movie isn't for everyone, and i won't push my opinions on you, but what i have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...it was the best i have ever seen!!! it was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie i had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because i didn't know what was gonna happen next. if you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!
