by tynesha mells. in this drama, ja rule, who stars as reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. his old friend j-bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps reggie find who murdered his father. a week after his dad died, a preacher, reverend packer, came up dead. reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? did reggie kill reverend packer or was it some type of a setup? back in the day also has a couple of romantic scenes. see, reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and j-bone doesn't approve of his love fiend. as j-bone tries to destroy what they have, reggie learns that love is about forgiveness. but what j-bone is doing, does it work? do reggie and his girlfriend break up, or does it bring them closer together? i like this movie because it leaves you wondering what's going to happen next and did this or that happen. i like movies with suspense! it kind of makes you want to be in the movie so that you could detect things. i also like this movie because everything falls in place, if you really pay attention to it!
