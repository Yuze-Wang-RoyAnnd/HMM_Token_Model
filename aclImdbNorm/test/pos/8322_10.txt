as john grierson pointed out: "the documentary genre can be defined like this: the creative interpretation of reality"<br /><br />this fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time a computer-generated project about dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer.<br /><br />when i saw jurassic park, which i was expecting with great excitement, i was left extremely disappointed. of course the dinosaurs were great, but the story-telling was unnecessary. i thought: "what if they made a documentary on dinosaurs, with no crying children or bad puns, just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible, to let us marvel at what was once reality."<br /><br />my dream came true. the bbc has produced an exhilarating documentary exploring the different eras of the dinosaurs.<br /><br />this part is to all the people that seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points concerning the behavior, skin patterns etc: of course they have to. nobody was there. i think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that. the guessings are all based on the knowings of many paleontologists, and it allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of what it was like. if you wanna stick to what we know for sure, then just go visit a dinosaur bones museum. that is why i incorporated the grierson quote at the beginning of this comment.<br /><br />anyway, hats off to the creators of it.
