stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics. this is, together with "das boot" one of the best war movies (together with the finnish "vinterkriget" ("the winter war", in english, i believe)). it depicts the ordeals of some of the german soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around stalingrad during world war 2. no big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war. the mood of the movie is similar to the one in "das boot", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, i guess. so, if you enjoy realistic, non-hollywoodish, war movies: rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it! finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, i only want to add that "stalingrad" isn't directed by wolfgang petersen (who made "das boot")!
