john ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'wagon master' made after two big indian-cavalry epics... it is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... it didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...<br /><br />photographically, it is extremely simple... the camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons... they come-and go-while the camera remains immobile and the audience stays a spectator to the march of history, not a participant in it... of course, when ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in 'stagecoach,' he knows just how to do it... but "wagon master" is a tender, nostalgic look backward...<br /><br />filled with traditional western songs rendered by the sons of the pioneers, it tells of the trek west to utah (in 1879) of a mormon wagon train led by ward bond in the role of elder wiggs, and two young horse traders (ben johnson and harry carey jr). and in a series of beautiful images, as the wagon train fights outlaws, indians and nature in its struggle to reach the 'promised land,' the modest 'wagon master' manages to capture the history and legend of the west... <br /><br />ford himself has said that 'wagon master' (of which he wrote the original story) was among the three films of his which 'came closest to being what i had wanted to achieve.'<br /><br />ford's career as a western director was astonishing... more than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family, society, and the american way of life... ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of settlers and lawmen whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after... these early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned, and the civilized townsfolk who followed must always hold them in fear and respect... ford's westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approach...<br /><br />in 'wagon master,' for example, folk songs on the sound track tell us of the hardships of the pioneers of a century ago, and ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion... in one sequence the train is camped in a circle and the settlers decide to hold a square dance... to fashion a dance floor they have to lay boards over the desert sand, and with this ritual celebration ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the land...<br /><br />it's a lovely-to-look-at film, full of a marvelous lighthearted optimism, and it is easy to understand why ford found it so satisfying
