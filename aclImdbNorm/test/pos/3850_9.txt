i'm not a massive disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! ok, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.<br /><br />great characters, phil harris stealing the show as thomas o'malley, but edgar the butler not far behind. the music is superb - my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to "everybody wants to be cat" this says it all. and "thomas o'malley" is just as enjoyable.<br /><br />i'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats! and yes, it does take a few of its cues from "101 dalmations", and maybe "the lady and the tramp" (it's been a long time since i've seen that, so i'm not going to compare them), and while "101 dalmations" is better in some ways, for me "the aristocats" is far more enjoyable. isn't that what these films are about? <br /><br />apart from "peter pan" (now that is a 10/10 film), this is my favourite disney film. my 7 year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film.<br /><br />superb!
