the trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between lazarus and rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.<br /><br />of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. however, at it's core, black snake moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along. maybe it's just me though, but i think poor lazarus should've had his story focused on more. he's a hurting man after his wife leaves him, but we never fully see how helping rae resolve her past pains heals him too. it's just implied that it does--in essence, he plays the wizard that helps the young rae overcome her curse, through a big ol' chain and some blues.<br /><br />i like the story, but i wish it were a bit more even and didn't have to rely on the sensational. the side characters were fairly decent, if simple and i liked the music. the acting was good enough, although i can't be certain if the rae character is fully believable. but that might just be my naivety.<br /><br />all in all, i liked the film, but i wasn't compelled by it. maybe it's that i'm too critical, but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so, while it all seemed very cool, i could never truly buy it. the chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. still, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues. 7/10
