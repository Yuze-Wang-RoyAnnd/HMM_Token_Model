hey guy, this movies is everything about choices. all the times in your life you must pick something or it just pass away... and this movie prove that! of course, life in fact is not like a beautiful picture as this movie shows... it not shows indeed but some may figure that. i'm trying to say it's full of pain, love and deep lessons of live. aaron, the mormon missionary is the real shepherd digging out the thing beautiful deep inside chisthian, the skin feeling guy...<br /><br />it's a great end and you do always believe in fate because it will surprise you in a turn or in other of your live like latter days...<br /><br />big deal watch it!!!
