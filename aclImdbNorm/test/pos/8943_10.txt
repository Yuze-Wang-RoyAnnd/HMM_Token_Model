i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it is hilariously funny from start to finish. the plot is simple and straight forward but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it. when i went to see this movie i hadn't heard much about it and i didn't know what to expect. i thought it was going to be an old ladies' type of film like calendar girls or something but it took me completely by surprise. even though i am still a teenager and the film was probably not directed at my age group, i still found it excellent and i think that people of all age groups would like it. i think it is a shame that it is not at all famous and it deserves more publicity so that more people will go and see it and realize what a great movie it is.
