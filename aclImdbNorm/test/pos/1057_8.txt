this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite, which i try to catch on tv every year if i can. it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane, charmingly portrayed by barbara stanwyck. however, in contrast to martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. the other cast members effectively complete the story, and include dennis morgan (jefferson jones), reginald gardiner (john sloan), and sydney greenstreet (alexander yardley).<br /><br />elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. in reality, she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and cannot boil an egg. her recipes are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend, felix. elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, alexander yardley, decides he wants a nice old fashioned country christmas, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a returning war hero, jefferson jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. yardley demands total honesty of his employees. to get out of her predicament and save her deception based career, elizabeth borrows the connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor, john sloan, a dull, fussy chap who has long sought marriage. she also borrows a neighbour's baby (actually, several) to pass off as her own and her 'husband' sloan's.<br /><br />of course this scenario makes for much merriment. it's a screwball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere. whenever i think of this movie, i picture the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roasting, and christmas cookies baking.<br /><br />why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? i understand there is a 1992 version, directed by arnold schwarzenegger and starring dyan cannon, kris kristofferson, and tony curtis. i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to. this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with it's a wonderful life, white christmas, miracle on 34th street, and of course all the versions of a christmas carol.
