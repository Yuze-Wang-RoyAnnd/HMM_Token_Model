i have seen so many bad reviews on supervivientes de los andes that i felt compelled to stand for it (or at least i'll try). first of all, of course that it looks dated, it was made in the seventies with very low budget, but that's part of it's charm. i like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth. i'm not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movies with modern treatments and effects; besides, almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures (who doesn't like films from el santo or plan 9 from outer space, no matter it's overall quality?). in the aspect of pace, is just a tool for covering (again) it's low cost, and i think the constant dialogs are in order of a better character and situations development. sure, alive has better fx, but i won't despise the old one just because of that, and i don't feel quite attracted to english speakers in an event involving people from uruguay and for me, that gives a plus to supervivientes de los andes. it's like, even if canoa, from the seventies and based on a true event too, would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology, but i think i would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it's production date.<br /><br />all of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time i saw it was on tv, and nowadays i don't think it has lost some of it's primal force. of course it's been a long time and i've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema, but that doesn't diminish it's true value. it's not a bad film, and i place it above alive without hesitation. just give it a break.
