i loved this film! fantastically original and different! a solid, intense, hard-core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of (dark?) humor. if you're tired of the typical, overdone, ridiculous hollywood b.s. movies, how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take, then this film is for you. fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable, and solid performances by all actors, not a weak character or performance in the film. skip woods' film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts, his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film (not a bad mix at all in my opinion). this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film. the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it, everyone i've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it. this film is a welcomed change/alternative from the canned hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today, even with their big name actors, big explosions, special effects and huge budgets. it's a terrifically wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw (i mean that in a good way, no phony hollywood polish here) ride. thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen, you did an incredible job!
