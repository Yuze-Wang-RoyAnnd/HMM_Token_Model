i thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that i saw in theaters. when my sister borrowed from a friend i decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .needless to say ten minutes in the movie and i loved it. amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comedic timing was perfect. the guy who played duke was hot, plain and simple. my favorite scene was definitely when amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses--as she is pretending to be a guy! i re-watched this part over and over... to make a long story short, the movie i thought was going to be lame--i now own it.
