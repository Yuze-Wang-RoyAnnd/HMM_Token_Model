jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006, beating the also hilarious clerks ii. it is one of the best sequels in recent memory, beating jackass the movie in every way. now, this film may be the funniest, but it is also the most offensive, appalling, and utterly disgusting. you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film. i'm completely serious when i say don't eat anything before watching or during this film, because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you. keep the drinking to a minimum as well. you've been warned, because, just like the tagline says, it will make you beg for mercy.<br /><br />jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass, johnny knoxville, bam margera, ryan dunn, steve-o, chris 'party boy' pontius, preston lacy, ehren mcghehey, dave england, brandon dicamillo, and jason 'wee man' acuna (chris 'raab himself' raab is absent) as they perform the most outrageous, life-threatening, and revolting stunts imaginable. i'm not going to tell what the stunts are, but i will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening, and that one cast member (once again, not telling) will flirt with death several times in the film.<br /><br />what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them. to put it simple, if they loved doing it and had a blast, you will too (this goes for 99% of the stunts). all the stunts are very original, and 90% of them are never-before-seen. you will witness a few recycled ones, but they're amped up. you wouldn't think directing really factors into a movie like this, but it does; jeff tremaine's direction makes the movie so much funnier, because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing, which is simply brilliant on his part. he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming (actually, you'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming), but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could. i give mr. tremaine two thumbs up for that. another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos, and this time they include bmx legend mat hoffman, skateboard god tony hawk, director/actor jay chandrasekhar (super troopers & beerfest), actor luke wilson, miami dolphins star jason taylor, and director/actor mike judge (office space). the scenes with hoffman, taylor, and chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, as it's even funnier to see these men as a part of the film.<br /><br />jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and just plain wrong movies of all time, if not the most. despite this, it is so original and so hilarious that you won't care about that. you'll be gasping for air, laughing so hard you'll be crying, and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film. due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this film. you've been warned. i hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as i did.<br /><br />10/10 --spy
