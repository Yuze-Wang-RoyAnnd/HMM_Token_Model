although this was a film of only less than forty minutes, it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen. it accomplishes in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot in more than 90.<br /><br />it is the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10. they come from a poor farm family in mississippi. both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of family.<br /><br />it brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed, plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behind.<br /><br />i can fully recommend this film as beyond superb !
