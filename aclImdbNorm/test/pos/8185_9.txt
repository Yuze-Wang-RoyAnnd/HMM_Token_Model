chen kaige gives us magnificent depth of atmosphere. yes, it's a 'period piece', but chen's artistic use of imagery makes it something more. the actors often behave like players using the stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of peking opera. all the actors in a scene play to the 'back wall' even when addressing each other. they are like spirits of the past enunciating with powerful clarity a story with urgent meaning for those in the present. combined with close attention to scale and masterful cinematography indoors and out, "jing ke ci qin wang" is a stunning tale told with great reverence in its own idiom that captivates completely.
