this is a beautiful, funny, vivid film. it's even better than "nuovo cinema paradiso" -- which it parallels but doesn't replicate. the story completes a full circle and had the theater beaming as the credits rolled. a hundred years after this story takes place, we're just as intrigued by flickering images in a dark theater.
