somehow, i missed many of the early farscape episodes, so i'm seeing them in all sorts of orders as they are repeated on various channels. i first caught it - entirely by accident - whilst lounging in a hotel room. the first 10 seconds had me completely hooked - this is what sf is all about.<br /><br />the characters are strong; and moya/pilot the living ship is what lexx should have been. the plots vary in quality, but none falls below excellent in my opinion. and i have to mention rygel - what a gloriously irreverent character! none of your smarmy sugar-coated star trek aliens here, this is the real deal - cynical, self-serving and replete with disgusting personal habits, rygel is the creation of a genius.<br /><br />last week the scifi channel showed "out of their minds" (the body-swapping episode). a true classic, i couldn't stop laughing from start to finish...<br /><br />long may farscape grace our screens!
