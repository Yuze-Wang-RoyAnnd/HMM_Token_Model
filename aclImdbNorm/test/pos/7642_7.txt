like a twisty country road, "tough luck" takes the viewer for a ride. there is nothing wrong with plot curves, as long as believability doesn't fly out the window. unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audience's belief tolerance. nevertheless, it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting, character development, and wonderful carnival atmosphere. do not expect to like any of the characters. armand asante, norman redus, and dagmara dominczyk, play shady con-artists, not exactly the type of person easily admired. the double crosses come fast and furious, and the final cross is a bit of a stretch. recommended. - merk
