this is one of stan laurel's best solo comedy's, before the 1927 teaming with oliver hardy. laurel is a very good actor in the film, and provides good comedy. the best scene in the film is when stan dances with mae laurel (his real-life common law wife), at the cafe espanol. stan does silly dances that are funny, without you hearing the music. i will recommend this to any stan laurel fan.
