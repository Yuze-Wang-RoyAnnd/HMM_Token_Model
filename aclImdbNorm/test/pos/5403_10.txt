have just seen this film, in australia on satellite. as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding gunmen, well to be absolutely blunt, this film is a prescient gem. a big bravo to all involved. i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods. the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own faltering family, albeit suburb. the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came. although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way.<br /><br />all in all a foreseeing of who and what we are. a most meaningful film and a must see.<br /><br />please note the date of this review.
