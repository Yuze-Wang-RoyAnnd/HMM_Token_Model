it's a soap-opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea. a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. i didn't get any emotion from it, the ideas are not at all new, the tension lacks, it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way. i mean you have this middle-aged, paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan. he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no issues with god (and one would probably expect that too), the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves (i can't get out of my mind bergman's cries and whispers, similar to this one in many respects, which simply bursts with emotions, and not all of them humane) etc. this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away. the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer. amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides, he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded.
