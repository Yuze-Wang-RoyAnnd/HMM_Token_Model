containing billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for billy crystal. this movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with steven seagal). this movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. the balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid. the discovery of billy crystal's talent scout/agent character in romania of a giant human is revealing and the behind the scene's view of movie agent is fascinating. yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self. eight out of ten stars.
