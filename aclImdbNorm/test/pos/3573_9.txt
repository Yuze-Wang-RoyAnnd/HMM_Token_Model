i actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. and amazingly i found it really original. i have commented on other colombian films before, and i agree that colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. but let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. unfortunately, this is how real people speak. the storyline and the pacing are brilliant, and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world the acting was great, and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in colombian soil. i think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment, with a beautifully well directed bluffing black humor comedy. it kind of reminded me of films like snatch, and others of the sort. i highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people, since colombian movies seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year.
