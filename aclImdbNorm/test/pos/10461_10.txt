this film offers many delights and surprises. when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from "don giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch. you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.<br /><br />babette is an artist whose medium is food. perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly.<br /><br />the main theme of this movie, the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world, is much the same as the theme of "chololat," but "babette's feast" does not hit you over the head with its message. the townspeople are conservative puritans, but not exaggeratedly oppressive. you come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity. <br /><br />many issues are raised for you to reflect on: the nature of art, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of environment on behavior, the taking of life to give life, among others.<br /><br />the only disappointment for me was general loewenhielm's speech delivered at the climax of the meal. i expected deep heartfelt observations, but i got some vague mystical ramblings. the speech had such a minimal impact that i hardly remember it.<br /><br />but this understated film leaves a lasting impression. the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop. you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.
