warning: spoiler,spoiler,spoiler!!!!<br /><br />this is written for filmgoers who may have walked away from "mood for love" perplexed and confused about paths the main characters choose in life. from reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics missed some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful tease of a movie.<br /><br />we are so use to seeing blatant sex in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmakers would suggest the "dirty deed" by simply showing the slack-mouthed couples ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip..."meet your child".<br /><br />the director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of mr chow and mrs chan. last warning...spoiler spoiler spoiler<br /><br />mr chow fools mrs chan into showing her real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever. next scene: mrs chan leans her head on mr chow in the taxi and says "i do not want to go home tonight". translation: "let's do it"<br /><br />why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouses,get a divorce,raise their love child and live happily ever after? the answer is that this whole story takes place in hong kong during the sixties. a bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an adulteress;whereas,a "legitimate" child could live a tragic but noble/honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating "father"-the invisible mr chan. in short,mr chow and mrs chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child.<br /><br />that is why mr chow,upon learning that mrs chan lives alone with a little boy gives a knowing smile and ends his dreams of making mrs chan his mrs chow. he then,also realizes why mrs chan went to all the way to singapore to be with him,only to reconsiders at the last momment and leave..,choosing to never see him again.(but not before taking some unnamed keepsake) mr chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell. no one,except for a crumbling temple wall and of course we the viewer,...but only if we listen carefuly.
