watching this on comcast on-demand.<br /><br />every time i see this musical, i am amazed at the songs...one show-stopper after another.<br /><br />this interpretation is, for me, magical. the songs sparkle...the vocals, orchestrations, and choreography are amazing for a "made-for-tv" movie...better than many stage versions i have seen.<br /><br />the debate over bette just doesn't make sense. she is mamma. her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother living through her daughters. i still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory, no matter how faded that glory is.<br /><br />the tulsa/louise duet/dance is on now. fabulous.<br /><br />stephen sondheim is the king of musical theatre. his lyrics just roll off the tongue like silk...styne's music is perhaps the best ever penned for the stage/screen.<br /><br />thank god we have this masterpiece of the american musical theatre captured on dvd.
