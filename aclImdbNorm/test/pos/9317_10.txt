before i continue forth with the new millennium, i will go back in time once more because i had completely forgotten about these gems!!!!!<br /><br />in 1987, disney, while still a "low" company in the 80s, was able to start a series of films on television called "not quite human," about a geeky teenager who, like in "inspector gadget," looks like a human but is really a robot!!!!! now this screams 80s, along with other films like "tron" and "honey, i shrunk the kids" because it combines everything of yesteryear with the technologies of tomorrow!!!!!<br /><br />my parents remember seeing this on the tv back then, back when i was just born or something. however, my very first encounter with this film was on the old disney channel (one time, i've seen this, and the other parts, on my 12th b'day in may of '99!!!!!)<br /><br />"not quite human" is a very good series of films to watch, if you can ever find these movies again. <br /><br />has this been shown recently? if so, give me an e-mail or personal message.<br /><br />10/10
