although this film looks like a crime thriller noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprise twists or turns at all - and those that do appear, are not exactly shockers.<br /><br />however, if you slip out of 'intense action thriller' mode and into 'mindless entertainment,' then this is really quite a fun movie, with several hilarious moments. most of these can be attributed to the witty dialogue between alan rickman and emma thompson's characters - but that said, sadie said it all in her hilarious opening greeting to friedman, and it left very little else for anything else to develop between these two characters. i didn't find these esteemed british actors version of the southern accents that bad (ok, thompson sounded like she was rolling marbles in her mouth as she tried to spoke southern, but rickman was surprisingly rather good with very few minor lapses into his customary english accent) - if you want to critique accents - lets discuss that of coco - she only spoke southern periodically!<br /><br />
