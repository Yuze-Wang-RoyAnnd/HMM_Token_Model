10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). i'll do each one separately:<br /><br />nicolas roeg (dir)--giuseppe verdi (music). a story about an assassination attempt in 1931 vienna. theresa russell (roegs wife) plays a man! not bad--very beautiful and exotic. russell is great.<br /><br />charles sturridge--verdi. no story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.<br /><br />jean-luc godard--jean baptiste lully. horrendous. pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing. filled with gratuitous female nudity. the worst!<br /><br />julien temple--verdi. buck henry, beverly d'angelo and anita morris star in this funny, if obvious, story about a cheating couple. pretty good.<br /><br />bruce beresford--erich korngold. short, lush and romantic. very good.<br /><br />robert altman--jean-philippe rameau. dull. a yawner.<br /><br />fran roddam--richard wagner. this has bridget fonda in her film debut. beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene. <br /><br />ken russell--giacomo puccini. really strange but ok.<br /><br />derek jarman--gustave chapentier. lyrical look at youth and old age. very sweet. <br /><br />the last is by bill bryden doing "i pagliacci". he has john hurt (!) dressed as a clown lip-syncing to caruso (!!!).<br /><br />when this came out it almost got an x rating (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). it was given an r with a strict warning attached saying the r rating would be heavily enforced. after the film bombed that warning disappeared.<br /><br />the idea isn't bad and 6 out of the 10 segments were worthwhile. worth seeing even if you don't like opera. just avoid the godard segment. i'm giving it an 8.
