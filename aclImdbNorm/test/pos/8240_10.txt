this little-known comedy from the hit play by ruth gordon is a delight. the script, based on the play, is spicy, rich, and completely undated. ditto the cast but i must underline the work of the leading lady,irene dunne. irene is simply superb - as usual - and lights up the screen with every frame she's in (and she's in it a lot, thank heaven). in addition, director vidor has given her some unusual close-ups that are mesmerizing. what a gal! i know of no other hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film. why she remains so little known is a mystery. i have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise, even for a solid id fan like myself. see it, everyone!
