i concur with what mallicka.b has said. the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. emotions aren't conveyed properly. i guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. in my view, tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai. in some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. i also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. i'm a bitter critic of aishwarya rai :) can't help it; sorry for that. 'raincoat' was a good movie by rituparno ghosh. and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat; i was not at all impressed.
