i was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told. and as i am huge fan of love, i bought the tickets and sat myself in the theatre. after 90 minutes i left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film. i was appalled at the story itself, that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it. i just couldn't go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier. the second time i ran into it... i was in a different mood, no longer had any expectation ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to "see" the film... and as soon as i opened my eyes, i discovered the love... the beauty of the film. i went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (not even for a moment did i ever felt like they were acting!) and the cinematography. the first time i heard a definition of what a film is, i was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots) and this is the film to match the description. almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with the music... and the light effects... the result is just a masterpiece! and a masterpiece is just something that you must have in your collection of films.
