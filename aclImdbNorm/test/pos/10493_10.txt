i first saw this film on hbo around 1983 and i loved it! i scoured all of the auction web sites to buy the vhs copy. this is a very good suspense movie with a few twists that make it more interesting. i don't want to say too much else because if you ever get a chance to see it, you'll be glad i didn't say too much!
