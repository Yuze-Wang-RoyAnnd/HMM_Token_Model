"opera" is a great film with some wonderful,imaginative imagery.an opera singer(cristina marsillach)is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying her up and taping needles under her eyes.this idea of the needles comes from the fact that argento doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies."for years i've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films.i film these images because i want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away.so i thought to myself 'how would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avert their eyes?'the answer i came up with is the core of what "opera" is about."-says argento.plenty of suspense,wonderful cinematography and brutal,gory murders.one guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound,daria nicolodi gets shot in the eye while looking through the peephole,etc.for anyone who hasn't caught this one yet,give it a try.highly recommended.
