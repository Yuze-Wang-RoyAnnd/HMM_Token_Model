the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong. if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how, and be sorely disappointed. it was a vastly more complex show than that. <br /><br />i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit, and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners. of course, that was before the show hit. i did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times, and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too. he was a real local. yes, i'd love to see this on dvd.
