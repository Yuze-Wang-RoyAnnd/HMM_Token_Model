this production, build on real danish crime stories, is a experience through excellent directing, acting on all levels and has a nerve not often seen in crime series. every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that "this is my life right now - this murder or murders are my responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant.<br /><br />as a viewer, you just have this wonderfully filling of being entertained cause it feels like their focus, on purpose or not, lie on that they wont you to have a good time...:o) don't miss this one, it's just right under 'band of brothers' quality and is a "must have seen" experience - what a wonderful crime time !
