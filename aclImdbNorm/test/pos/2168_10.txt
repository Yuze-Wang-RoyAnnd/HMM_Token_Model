black scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored scorpion mobile. she battles the evil breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time imho. i loved the bit about her having to say "yo" to get the car's computer to take orders! breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! it's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! the scene where black scorpion "attacks" her partner steals the show. you'll know it when you see it. this dvd also has a fun interview with joan severance. she's a doll. black scorpion is a fun dvd. loved it!
