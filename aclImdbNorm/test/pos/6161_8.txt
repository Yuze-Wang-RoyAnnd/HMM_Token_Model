this is such a beautiful movie! not only does it portray war, it also has friendship & love. the life of slama is filled with sadness, every aspect of his life fell apart. i can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />i see a slight similarity to 'pearl harbor', which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman. however this film is much better made, because this does not portray the woman to be unfaithful & easy-going. the friendship between the two men is also much more convincing & well built-up. i definitely recommend this movie to all people.
