i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman (horrible! 3/10) and amityville remake (so-so 6/10) i enjoyed this a lot more! as seen in the trailer, one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be "forgotten" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it is.<br /><br />my only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan "that's hot" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???).<br /><br />there is no nudity from the 2 girls although paris looks great in her lingerie! i'm surprised they didn't put a 3rd "hot token victim" in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick! i won't list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris & eliza both get roughed up good! <br /><br />the characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable (not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror films.<br /><br />i give it a 8/10 as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it. if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you'll have a good time.<br /><br />noah
