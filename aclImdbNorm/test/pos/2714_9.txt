i watched this film in a singapore theatre yesterday (4 february, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.<br /><br />ms aparna sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.<br /><br />we have had hollywood movies on this subject such as "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" where jack nicholson carried away the honours. since then research has helped provide more insights into the problem and clearing some misconceptions about treatment. in "... cuckoo's nest," for example shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." the point has been made that it is not as bad as it has been made out to be.<br /><br />the other misconception is that abuse in childhood is a cause for schizophrenia. but scholars such as dr. e. fuller torrey have emphasised that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots.<br /><br />it is now established that schizophrenia can be treated like any clinical ailment and its advance can be checked if detected early. even in fairly advanced stages regular medication and counselling can be effective.<br /><br />the same understanding shown by ms sen is evident in the way the actors play out their parts. in keeping with the gravity of the theme, the acting is controlled throughout with ms konkana sen-sharma's evocative silences and eyes mirroring the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the rantings we are used to in most of the movies that have included mentally challenged characters.<br /><br />like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending. it leaves lot of questions hanging in terms of the plot.<br /><br />has meethi's search ended? why is she not found in no. 15? were children actually playing when meethi strode past the gates with her eyes sparkling with recognition? can anyone sort out this jigsaw puzzle?
