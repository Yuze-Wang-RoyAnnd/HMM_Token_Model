"one true thing" is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired greatly greatly inspired performances. i am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting, because it isn't. in fact, the movie is down right depressing. i am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd.<br /><br />i cried in "one true thing," enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of 1998. the characters were perfectly casted. the performances are all guaranteed oscar nominees, especially meryl streep, who portraits the dying kate extremely well. her acting alone was enough to make the movie excel to the point of recommendation, and gives you a new point of view at her. i also thought that ren'ee zellweger portrayed a realistic single, free-wheeling woman who has to take care of their own mother. the other cast members including william hurt & tom everett scott, were also superb. the script of this movie was really fantastic. it is kind of funny how the movie's concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area. you see, i live near lansing, michigan, and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor jack kavorkian's (excuse my miss-spelling if so) ways have just been outlawed. the public will vote on this according to their beliefs in november after watching "one true thing" it really changed my perspective at this topic, although i have always believed in it. without revealing the ending of the film i will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and i think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story. overall, this movie does indeed have more emotional impact than "titanic," "saving private ryan" or any other tearjerker released in the last few years. i think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it relates better to an audience. and indeed, that this could happening to you.
