the third film from the polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film yet. though many audiences will have a problem with northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "stick with it, jack!". the plot is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, god in a cowboy hat, the selling of angel wings, and a sick orphan (but it all works). m. david mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. the performances of the actors, working with the polish brothers' inspiringly offbeat script, are pitch-perfect and give the film its emotional punch. the strong-willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that michael polish shows behind the camera. again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience. a great, great, great movie!!!
