previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and the third man, director carol reed's classic film noir starring orson welles and joseph cotten. this similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately. it is, indeed, high praise to be compared to robert krasker's academy award- winning cinematography in the third man. <br /><br />the plot of stolen identity also has been delineated fairly accurately but in rather ordinary terms. i found it highly creative and entertaining. as common as the "mistaken - or stolen - identity" device is in both theater and cinema, it is only a device and not to be mistaken for the plot, itself. consequently, while the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand" times, the plot of stolen identity is full of surprises and twists based upon this device. it is the unexpected turns that make this film much fresher, more original and engrossing than a plot synopsis might convey. stolen identity doesn't rely on the kind of suspense that characterizes most film noire, because there is no real mystery here. instead, it relies on constant, smaller surprises. in short, the mistaken identity device is rather common; but this plot is not.<br /><br />finally, although i was not familiar with the cast, i found the acting to be uniformly good, occasionally outstanding. i easily could have imagined other actors turning this film into a melodrama, with bombast, overblown gestures and obvious facial expressions. the acting is always more restrained and subtle. donald buka is especially restrained and credible, never "blowing his cover" with an obvious facial expression as we see too often in films that depend on the maintenance of subterfuge to sustain dramatic tension.<br /><br />the only disappointment in this otherwise fine film was the very weak development of the love story sub-plot. as it stands, it seems like an afterthought - a mild surprise, in fact - tacked on to the end. or perhaps during their shared ordeal, the actors simply couldn't convey a palpable level of chemistry that i could appreciate. this sub-plot should have been made more apparent as the story unfolded. all in all, i thought this film was a fine little gem, and i wondered why i had not seen it before. try it, you'll like it.
