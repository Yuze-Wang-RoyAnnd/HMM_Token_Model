if you're a long-time fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series, rest easy -- it more than meets the high expectations of the original. the pacing is much quicker than the original shows, fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. the writing is excellent, the acting superb. the hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. compared to the original, it's got some now. (although i will always have fond memories of bubble-wrap and hand-puppet monsters.) if you're not a fan, or if you tried the original and couldn't get a handle on it, jump in with both feet now! everything you really need to know about the doctor, they'll tell you as they go along. this series was written with minimal references to the doctor's enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers. admittedly, i'm only seeing the first new series now as it's being shown on the sci-fi channel (in other words, probably cut to ribbons for time constraints), but i'm looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd. (july 4th can't come soon enough!)
