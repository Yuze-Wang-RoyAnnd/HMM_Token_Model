not only does this movie have a great title but quite simply is the greatest drama i have ever watched. the viewer is irrestiblely drawn into the movie involving 5 young men working together to try and overcome insumaintable odds, sean astin as billy tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles from t.e.russell, wil wheaton and shawn phelan, the guidance and leadership of gosset's and astins characters makes the movie so much better. as time goes on the movie keeps gathering momentum and its a dissapointment that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie.
