i think this movie is different apart from most films i've seen. it was exciting in a way, and no matter what others say, i say, i was surprised about the final solution. certainly didn't see it coming!! although it's sad, it's worth watching.. i can't think of any movie that would be like this! actors knew what they were doing. if you say this movie sucks, you say probably what most people would say. but, if someone says that this movie is ordinary, i absolutely don't agree. and norman reedus should be more noticed.<br /><br />maybe i'm freak but i liked this very much. it was kind of mess, but who cares? i'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
