after i first saw this, i thought, "wow, this is the most spectacular movie, visually-speaking, i've ever seen." since that time, i've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department. i'm just disgusted the long-awaited dvd was so poorly done, the quality of this transfer hardly better than the vhs tape.<br /><br />the jungle scenes are filmed in cameroon, and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. except for jungle sounds, "seeing" is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no "hearing," no dialog until tarzan (christopher lambert) befriends ian holm and vice-versa....so be ready for that, if you haven't watched this film. <br /><br />story-wise, all i'll say is this is not the tarzan many of us came to know in johnny weismuller films.....but that's not a complaint. for those craving action, and don't care about cinematography as i do, you just have to get past that silent introduction period <br /><br />in this tarzan version, our hero goes back to scotland (his roots), adapts to that environment (for the most part....and a little too quickly for credibility, frankly) and then returns to the jungle without jane. this is supposedly more true to the tarzan books, written by edgar rice burroughs.<br /><br />the special effects in here were done by rick baker, one of the best in the business. sharp dvd or not, this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
