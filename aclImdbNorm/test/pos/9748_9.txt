after 66 years "flash gordon" still has an appealing scifi/adventure/epic feel that many of today's science fiction adventures strive for and fail to deliver. the only way to fully enjoy this serial is just to sit back and not pick at anything (hokey effects, dialogue, why flash doesn't go for princess aura etc.). and as for you older people who saw "flash gordon" back on the serial screen or on t.v. "back in the day", if you want this fine serial to remain appealing to future generations, get your kids/grandkids to watch this when they're young. it worked for me (male aged 18 or under). 9 out of 10
