i am so happy not to live in an american small town. because whenever i'm shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. in this movie a former doctor, who's just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash, directs his steps to the nearest small town - he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns - which happens to be the purgatory flats. and, of course, as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose. he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. but there is a tiny handicap, she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead. to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself. i'll just tell you that it's slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties.
