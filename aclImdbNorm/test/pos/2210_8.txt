i was surprised to like this movie since i'm from the "check your brain at the door and have fun" school of film viewing. however, this film touched my heart. i have friends like mentally retarded emily. i have friends like unsocialized evie. and i've been in evie's shoes, chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others.<br /><br />amy madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with evie were raw and painful to watch. and perhaps i am denser than most, but i never saw the twist with evie's father coming. usually i cotton on to those things rather quickly.<br /><br />my reservations are similar to others posted here. i thought christopher lloyd's wonderful, sympathetic character (a very different role for him, i thought) was underused. what happened to him once he realized what was going on with the poetry? would he, like james, try again??? second, the ending, such as it was, didn't seem to resolve or accomplish anything. i didn't expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tied neatly, but i felt that i was left at odds with the characters, that there was no real healing taking place here or any real efforts at healing being made.<br /><br />otherwise, exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and, for some, very, very true.
