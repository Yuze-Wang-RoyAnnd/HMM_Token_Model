it was 1983 and i was 13. i watched valley girl on hbo one night when my parents were working. after it ended i wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. we woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. we began to worship the main character, julie, played by the beautiful deborah foreman. i am not saying this is a great classic. although it is for me personally. and i understand that the whole valley girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's. but deep down at the heart of the movie-it is a love story, and a familiar but good one. girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. julie's friends don't like him-he doesn't fit in, doesn't go to their school, doesn't have money. they like her better with her ex-boyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk. she makes the ultimate sacrifice-her own happiness for her friends' happiness. and she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. it is one of nicholas cage's first movies and his first starring role. one minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic. his friend fred is pretty funny too. if you were a teenager in the 80's you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories. it is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. i am eagerly awaiting it's release on dvd if they ever release it. you can go to deborah foreman's website to sign a petition to get it released on dvd and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music.
