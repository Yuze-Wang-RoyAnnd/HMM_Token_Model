reading through the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of la pianiste. i find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by isabelle huppert. huppert is gripping - she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge, full of self-hate and delusion.<br /><br />the film is wonderfully paced and judged. it would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure - consider the scene in the porn store for instance. somehow, huppert is able to carry it off, partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable.<br /><br />don't ignore this film. it is one of the most startling and engaging films (and performances) i have seen.<br /><br />trust boris!
