a great combination: - chabat's humor - uderzo/goscinny world and characters - limited presence of christian clavier<br /><br />the original comics was great - one of the better of an overall great series - and alain chabat, one of the funniest member of the famous french group les nuls, was able to film, replicate and supplement, the great work done by goscinny and uderzo by cleverly enforcing the story, giving to djamel debouze his best role (at last a little bit far from his usual repeatable part), gathering a bunch of great actors (gerard darmon is wonderful, as often, chabat himself is a great cesar).<br /><br />in addition, while being obligated to keep on with christian clavier as asterix, chabat cleverly tuned down his role in the movie to give prominence to darmon and debouze... which is always a good idea!<br /><br />=> great environment, great scenario, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful cleopatra... this movie would have deserved a 10 if clavier hadn't been involved.
