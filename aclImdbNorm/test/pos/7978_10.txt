this is a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises - some good entertainment. after all, when a movie proclaims it features top sass shooters, you have to figure that it is not a likely candidate for the "best picture" oscar. those guys are shooters, not actors. your next clue is that the movie doesn't star nicholas cage or jennifer aniston, i.e. you shouldn't expect to see the current hottest names. it was meant to be just plain old entertainment and in that regard it is every bit as good as a lot of the old "oaters" i have seen through the years.<br /><br />so what do you get with "hell to pay"? you get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. you get a chance to see some stars from past years, who act pretty much like what they did in their prime but a little older. you get to see some good sass shooters in major roles and a few sass hams in the background. it was a lot of fun for me seeing people that i have shot with, visited in their homes and who are my good friends get to do something that a lot of people only ever dream about - they're in a real, live honest to gosh movie. they're doing something a lot of wannabe actors and wannabe shooters will never get the chance to do and i think that alone makes it worth the watch.<br /><br />admittedly, not everyone is a sass member and so i saw lots of fun and humor that others may miss, but it is still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly, there are a lot of movies in the theatre right now that i wouldn't give a nickel to see, so save the money to go see "brokeback mountain" get "hell to pay" and watch some real cowboys have some fun.
