after the success of "muppet babies" warner brothers chalked up "tiny toons". but instead of making bugs bunny, daffy duck and all the rest of the looney toon gang kids, they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless mirrored their predecessors. the leads included buster & babs bunny (no relation, which became their running gag or catch phrase), plucky duck, hampton pig, dizzy devil, shirley 'the' loon, elmira, montana max, furball, sweety, the rats and assorted animals of perfecto prep, and the original looney toons cast themselves. the "tiny toons" lived in acme acres and attended acme looniversity, where the looney toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy.<br /><br />during the show's run, various pot shots were taken at the bush sr. administration, pop culture, and coupled with various other gags and spoofs.<br /><br />buster & babs, arguably the show's main characters, as mentioned above, were similar to bugs bunny in some respects, but they also had their own differing personality ticks and comic styles, namely, babs' tendency to impersonate anyone and everyone, while buster, capable of being a great goof himself, usually played straight man (or straight rabbit) to babs' antics. plucky duck was a virtual copy of daffy duck (not screwball daffy but egomaniac daffy), with nearly as big an ego as daffy and just as much of an obsession with upstaging the buster & babs as daffy had with upstaging bugs, though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts, yet he remained strangely endearing through out. hampton was an even more shy version of porky pig, and he had the thankless job of playing porky to plucky's daffy. shirley, the blond duck gal, was a new age valley girl type whom plucky would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections. dizzy was the purple version of the tasmanian devil. furball was the silent sylvester and sweety was the pink tweetie bird. there was also the purple female skunk who longed for a boyfriend and the pint sized versions of wile coyote and the road runner. evil was defined in the form of montana max, a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people's lives miserable. there was also elmira, a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared. and then there was godo dodo, an odd thing-a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly designated species except that he was from "wacky land" or something like that.<br /><br />pop culture references included batman (quite frequently actually), michael jackson, vanilla ice, dances with wolves, indiana jones, star trek, supergirl, fast food joints, the ten commandments, the twilight zones, saturday night live and even the simpsons, among others.<br /><br />not only funny, but it also managed to be warm and touching, something it's successor "animaniacs" never quite attained. also followed by "taz-mania".
