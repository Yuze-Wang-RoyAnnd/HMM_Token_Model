these kinda movies just don't get the credit they deserve. this is my 2nd all time favorite movie, (stand by me being 1st.) the reason i watched this movie was because wil wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean astin. i just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me. everything in the movie is very exceptional. the script, the acting, the screenplay. i was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn't in the room i would have absolutely balled whenever joey trotta (wil wheaton) died. i did not see that coming!! at all!! i was real surprised when i heard that it wasn't real popular back in the 90's. i was born a few years after it came out so, of course, i didn't go see it in the theaters, but im sure i would have if i would have been alive. if any of my friends watched this, they would be like, "uhh okay?" but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. if you haven't seen this movie, or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch.
