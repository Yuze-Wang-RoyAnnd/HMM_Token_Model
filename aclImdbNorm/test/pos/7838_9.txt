i've just seen a couple of episodes of "eleventh hour", but i must say that they were enough to impress me. this series is just so impressive and interesting... i'm definitely going to follow it.<br /><br />first of all, i must say that the acting is top-notch. patrick stewart plays his character - ian the scientist - believably and coolly, and he makes the audience believe in the character. other characters, such as rachel, are also believable, and, although they sometimes are a little cold - due to the way the series is filmed - they're interesting.<br /><br />the stories told by this series are also interesting. for example, one of the episodes i saw was about cloning, and a man who was trying to clone humans. the way the episode was developed, and how ian - stewart - kept following clues and saving people was amazing. in addition, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad could this be.<br /><br />anyway, i think this is one good tv shows. i just hope it keeps going on like this - interesting, thought-provoking and with good acting. even though it's filmed in a kind of cold way - little lightning, cold photography, lots of close-ups - it never stops being interesting. highly recommendable.
