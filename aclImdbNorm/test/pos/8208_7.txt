following the advice of a friend, i got myself this movie. i'm very fond of computers in general - hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the internet could not be left unseen. i had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, i wasn't so disappointed : the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. i was gladly surprised when i figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computer-performed actions are somehow realistic, as they use windows 3.x and normal computers. the storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. the end is typically american. the actors' performance is globally ok, sandra bullock usually annoys me with her "oh my god why me" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. i'd recommend that movie.
