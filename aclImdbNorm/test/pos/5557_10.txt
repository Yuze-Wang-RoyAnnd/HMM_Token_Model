faqrscape is truly one of those shows that just has it all, great acting,great cast,great writing,sets,chemistry,muppets...it's got it all and then some, except a home. this fantastic series it's seem has it all except and ending. tptb seem to think this is a series that is consecutive single set shows, when anyone who watches know this is an ongoing ,one epic, love story, that has an end that must been seen. if you have never watched farscape do youself a favor and check it out on dvd when the season 1 will be released in october....and season 2 is the best there is! watch the reruns on the scifi channel to catch up and then the new season starts in january through march when most shows are going in to hiatis and be sure to watch. if all goes well we will get our ending!
