i had my son for the weekend and my parent's called me up and said that they wanted the two of us to meet them at the movies. when i got there, my mom said that she really wanted to see "the women" and asked if my son and i minded due to it being labeled as a chick flick. i reluctantly agreed thinking this was going to be another "first wives club" type movie. i gotta say that i was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the movie from the opening scene to the credits. it was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles. my son and i found ourselves laughing through entire movie and we are glad that we saw it. it made for a great saturday afternoon movie and i highly recommend it to anyone, man or woman.
