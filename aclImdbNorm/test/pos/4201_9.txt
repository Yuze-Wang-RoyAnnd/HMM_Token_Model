whoever plays the part of j. douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. he apparently received no credits. too bad.<br /><br />all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents ( i guess that should be bowery ). they even show some swimming abilities.<br /><br />i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film. busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move, the camera moves up to his face. i will not give away why or when, but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters.<br /><br />some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes. just his face. actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john. the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley, jr.<br /><br />now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, watch grandma's hands. may robson does her part well. she seems to have hands that wander a bit. in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's (john garfield) dressing room, watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunks.<br /><br />a great ending. lots of wonderful characters.<br /><br />best line might be at the gas station, "...eight gallons, that's a dollar twenty-eight..." tom willett
