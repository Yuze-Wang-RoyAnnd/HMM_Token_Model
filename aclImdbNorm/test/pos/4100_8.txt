as a film buff, i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being woody allen's quip "if i had my life to live over again i wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of lost horizon"). therefore i've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. just recently i came across a widescreen dvd and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. he really enjoyed it, and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices i obviously had about the film - so did i. there is nothing especially bad about lost horizon, and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies. it isn't even especially camp. the lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic, but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. as for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart since liv ullmann, olivia hussey and peter finch were dubbed (brilliantly too, as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly), and sally kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style. vocally, kellerman's duet with olivia hussey on "the things i will not miss" is excellent. special mention should be made of the legendary hollywood star charles boyer's brilliant performance as the high lama - and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world. i wouldn't claim for a second that lost horizon is a masterpiece (the things i wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography, and bobby van's "question me an answer" number, which could easily have been cut), but if you haven't even seen lost horizon, or haven't seen it for some time, try watching without that "oh boy, let's have a laugh at this pile of junk" attitude, and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is.
