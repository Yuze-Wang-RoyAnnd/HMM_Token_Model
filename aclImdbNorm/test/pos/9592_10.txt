to anyone who is interested, i have managed to get this on dvd from ebay (haven't received it yet - any day now).<br /><br />i have been desperate to get this even if it is a vhs quality put on a dvd i don't mind. so to anyone interested get in touch with me and maybe i can help you out.<br /><br />to be honest it's ridiculous that i've had to wait nearly 7 years to see this again but boy it will be worth it.<br /><br />all my mates at work are desperate to see it too.<br /><br />anyway i'll post later regarding the quality.<br /><br />just do a search on ebay if u want it guys. it's there to buy
