this movies had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my entire life. i laughed so hard i almost puked. after the movie was done i laughed for about an hour just thinking about the very last seen in the movie. its is definitely 100 times better than the first jackass movie. i loved seeing all of them back together again. if you are squeamish or don't like raunchy childish humour you will not like this movie. if you can go in with an open mind and not take it so seriously then you will laugh your ass off. its amazing no one was killed in this movie. every seen in this movie is so original and so different from the next you will not know what to expect. <br /><br />mike webber
