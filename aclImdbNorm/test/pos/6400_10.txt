i think that "key west" might do well as a dvd. there probably are a lot of failed star treks that just never had a chance to succeed. we will never know if this could have been a great series. i would love to know if there is a way to see older shows like this or are they just another hollywood footnote? is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we loyal oddballs can enjoy them again? the show had a great writing talent and some if not all of the episodes left you with a feel for the characters that is often missing in todays hit shows.i often came away with a sense of learning something from the story lines and greatly entertained by the very unique characters. thank you.
