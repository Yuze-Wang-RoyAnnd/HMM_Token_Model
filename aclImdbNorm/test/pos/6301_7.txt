i saw this interesting film back to back with the chinese/french film "2046" at the recent dubai film festival. both were intelligent works made the same year (2004/2005). both had the main characters living in a "hotel". in both films, the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a location. both dealt with love between a man and a woman. both had wonderful music and riveting performances. what a coincidence and yet how the two films differ in treatment of the subject! somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man walking on a pavement turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamp post. the audience erupts into a volcano of laughter innocently. but isn't that brief shot the synopsis of the film, that entertains you for 2 hours? while the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy (e.g., using a stethoscope to listen to neighbor's conversation), the film builds on what buster keaton and jacques tati had introduced to cinema earlier--stoic faces that leads to comedy quite in contrast to the equally intelligent world of robin williams or the heartwarming danny kaye. a sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character while moving money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of tati's works.<br /><br />but the film is not mere comedy. the anti-automation statement (cash counting and the reaction of the bank staff to the statements relating to it, the dummy that acts as an ineffectual warning to the speeding lady, the reference to "moulimix" as the fictitious "company" he works for, etc.) are several cues that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer. laugh, yes, but reflect on it and enjoy further..<br /><br />the movie's strength lies in is brief, staccato script (by director paul sorrentino) that offers comedy that is mixed with philosophy ("truth is boring," "dad is dead, but nobody told him," "bad luck does not exist--it is the invention of the losers and the poor". then the director goes on to provide you with a fascinating lecture from the main character on insomniacs. you will not sleep through this lecture.<br /><br />sorrentino provides entertainment pegged to the subject the italians know best--the mafia. it is an existential mafia film.<br /><br />since "truth is boring", the director provides a dessert as part of the fine meal of superb acting (toni servillo), good music, clever camera-work (luca bigazzi), a beautiful, enigmatic actress (magnani, grand-daughter of the great anna) and powerful script. the dessert is for the viewer to figure out whether what preceded in the film was the truth. it would have been boring, if it was, wouldn't it?
