i first saw love in limbo playing late on free to air tv about five years ago, and since then it's a movie i'll always remember warmly as one of those films you see and are forever influenced by.<br /><br />for the uninitiated, australian film has a long history of making off-beat comedies about lovable losers, and love in limbo is a sterling example of this. whilst russel crowe is the only name actor in it (although these days he's all a movie needs), the rest of the aussie cast is good- he still steals the show as a nervous, nerdy, virgin loser though.<br /><br />the general premise is a lot like american pie. a group of friends wanting to get laid and become men. as you'd expect, the entire movie focusses on this (with a sub-plot about the lead's mother and various other incidents), and is full of humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet ending.<br /><br />if you enjoyed american pie, don't expect this to be the same- but expect the same conventions to make appearances. love in limbo isn't a gross out romantic comedy- but it definitely has its share of laughs, fist pumping moments when the good guy wins, and the situations every guy, australian or otherwise, can relate to.<br /><br />see it if you liked: american pie, almost famous. strengths: good aussie cast, easy to relate to, good perve value. weaknesses: predictable at points. my rating: 8 out of 10
