as soon as i saw the ad for "changi" on the history channel, i knew i'd love it. it captured the anzac spirit fantastically - you would die if you didn't have mates around you. the characters of "changi" were strong and each brought something different into the story, and the japanese soldiers weren't criticised, but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just as the australians were doing. direction, screenplay, acting and setting were all done wonderfully, with a clear easy-to-follow plot. humour was the soldiers' key to survival, and it was great to see a mini-series about war actually have some sort of humour in it, which is usually difficult to do without offending people. from what i've read about soldiers in changi pow camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those australian, british, new zealand, american and dutch men spent there. i would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.
