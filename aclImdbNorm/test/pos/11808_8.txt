junior high and high school teachers will find "the cure" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to "huckleberry finn" or as a stand-alone lesson. although aids is supposed to be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between eric and dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. i also suggest directed class discussion about how eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend.
