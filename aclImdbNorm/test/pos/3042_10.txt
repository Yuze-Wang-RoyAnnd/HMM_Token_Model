i saw this film on tv in the uk some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. my interest has recently been rekindled by visiting hilton head - the next island over from "yamacraw" (daufuskie actually), and reading pat conroy's excellent "the water is wide". with the benefit of knowledge i have reappraised conrack and consider it a masterpiece. jon voight captures the spirit of conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a hollywood rarity. <br /><br />three things still strike me about this tale: 1. the issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and being inclusive remain the same. 2. education is about more than reading and writing. 3.. these kids were my peers, i was 6 in 1969 when pat conroy spent his year on daufuskie.<br /><br />why this has not made it on to dvd yet?
