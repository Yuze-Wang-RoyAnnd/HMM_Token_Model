i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this. hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the southwest his stories hit home! adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. wake up hollywood, not everyone thinks that your mel gibson's are cool! many movie goer's today want to see films that make you think. i have seen all of the redford/hillerman series. they are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. i'm hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more! thank you adam beach and tony hillerman for great entertainment! if anyone get's a chance to read tony hillerman's latest book do so! it's great. i also recommend traveling through arizona, new mexico, utah and colorado. stop at every view site and feel the setting of hillerman's books. amazing experience.
