my mom and i went to the ft worth premiere mainly to see george strait, but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at bass hall. what a wonderful, beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful texas landscape, but also had a great feel-good storyline. it was well written, directed and produced and my mom and i loved it from start to finish!. thank you jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. it was a night we will never forget. as if seeing the movie was not enough, we also were fortunate enough to be sitting 4 rows in front of my favorite singer, george strait!! thank you, thank you, thank you!! keep up the great work and again, thank you!<br /><br />debbie mcclendon & maureen daugherty ft. worth, tx
