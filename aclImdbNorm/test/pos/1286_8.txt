great film. no gratuitous gimmicks like in most hollywood films. everything supported the suspense of the plot. b&w gave it a basic, no-frills feel also. in short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast.<br /><br />following serves as an interesting contrast to memento. characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. in that sense, both reminded me somewhat of "in the company of men," also highly recommendable. one difference between nolan's two films is that memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that the b&w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do those in color. i don't think that was true of following, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. if you have the choice between vcr and dvd, i'd highly recommend dvd, since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit ingenuous) order presented by nolan. it also makes it easier, upon a second viewing, to piece the order together for yourself, if you want to.<br /><br />as another viewer noted, one of the best things about both this movie and memento is that none of the cast were famous. they were characters, not big-name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies.<br /><br />given certain similarities in the plots, i wonder if memento is sort of a remake of following, but intended to reach a bigger audience, like edward burns made she's the one in the mold of -- and with largely the same cast as -- the brothers mcmullan.
