after a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track, they accept an offer of help from lonely local mr. slausen (chuck connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins. once at the creepy roadside attraction, the friends are stalked by a mask-wearing lunatic who can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind.<br /><br />tourist trap's bad guy is a demented cross between the texas chain saw massacre's leatherface and anthony, the scary kid from the classic twilight zone episode 'it's a good life', whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned tcm, hitchcock's psycho, and house of wax. the atmosphere and execution of tourist trap, however, is so totally off-kilter that, in this respect, it's virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies.<br /><br />director david schmoeller's continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality, and with a brilliant left-field performance from connors, an impossibly creepy score from pino donaggio, a collection of truly unsettling mannequins with detachable jaws, and the presence of super sexy tanya roberts, who spends the film in (and briefly out of) tiny denim hot-pants and a figure hugging boob-tube, tourist trap is a totally unforgettable and ultimately one-of-a-kind horror experience well deserving of its cult following.
