i have seen this film on a sunday evening and i must say there is no better way to end the weekend. i am totally pleased with the humor and the warm charm this film offers. it simply leaves me in beautiful mood. watching this film means having a great time and keep a warm feeling.<br /><br />the film offers sharp black british humor and feels very fresh to me. you really enjoy the story and the characters. brenda blethyn is so great. i don't know exactly why. she's too old to be a love interest for me and too young to be my mother. but i really feel comfortable when she shows up in the movie.<br /><br />some may say the story was thin and predictable. but who cares? there simply has to be a happy end, dancing in the sunshine! are the characters stereotypes or cut outs? i don't know- better i don't care! i just loved them and enjoyed watching them.<br /><br />furthermore, i must say that i usually don't like romantic comedies. but this one is outstanding: a black comedy with a heart of gold !!
