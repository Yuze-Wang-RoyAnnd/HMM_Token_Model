i adore this film. the chemistry between the two leads miller and carlisle is amazing, they spark so well off of each other, creating an unlikely comedy duo. alan cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it up. the acting is superb and it is a genuinely amusing and touching film. not the greatest film ever made, i'll admit, but it is a huge amount of fun, and i would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty brit flicks. includes some of the best british actors, including michael gambon so you can't go far wrong. look out for cameos from david walliams and matt lucas of little britain and rock: profile fame.
