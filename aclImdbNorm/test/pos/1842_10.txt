awesome movie! great combination of talents! i'm a huge fan of david duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie! i would love to see him in more movies of this nature. his talents are definitely under-used and has so much more to offer besides "agent mulder" (although i'm a huge fan of that series too), anyway, i want to see more of him. he is easily the cary grant of our generation. if you haven't seen this movie, you must! great love story that shows love never dies... it's with you forever. minnie driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast containing mr. o'connor and mr. loggia and mr. belushi? this movie didn't get any type of awards nod, but deserved one. great job bonnie hunt! ** by the way... the soundtrack is great too! **
