two hands restored my faith in aussie films. it took an old premise and made it fresh. i enjoyed this movie to no end. i recommend it to those people who like guy ritchie films. bryan brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role tailor made for him. ledger was adequtely dumb and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.
