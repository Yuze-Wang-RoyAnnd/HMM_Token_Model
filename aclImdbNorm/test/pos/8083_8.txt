"the vicious circle" is a very unknown british mystery story. like many hitchcock movies, it's about a man who is being accused of a crime he didn't commit, and does everything he can to prove it. this time it's a dr. latimer (john mills), who finds a murdered german actress from his floor. as an honest man, the doctor calls scotland yard, which turns out to be a big mistake...<br /><br />there's really nothing special in this little movie. still, watching the film is an entertaining way to pass time. i enjoyed following the plot development. fine actors are a plus.
