the subject is banal, even in 1942. it is war propaganda. the fascists are among us and they are doing all they can to sabotage the war effort and to prepare their victory and their seizure of power then and their establishing an effective totalitarian state. but hitchcock has to make it a real thriller. so he invents a first sabotage that succeeds but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the prime suspect and run-away for the sabotage. that enables him to so-to-say visit the country and discover the tricky organization of the local nazis who have acquaintances and support in the top benevolent society and use the small little dissatisfied whites to do the dirty work. the chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from los angeles to new york and to the top of the organization. he meets a blind pianist who believes his senses to know the chap is not guilty, his niece who is a star of the advertising billboard but also a frenetic and fanatic patriot who only thinks of going to the police. then the rich rancher and his nest of plotters. then, on the road some sympathetic and friendly truck driver, and the long caravan of a circus going around and their dwarf, bearded woman, siamese sisters, and a few other grotesques of that type. and he discovers the target in a soda city, an electric dam that provides los angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. he takes part as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a uss alaska military ship when it is launched. and finally with some inventiveness, creativity and elbow grease he and the pianist's niece manage to get the whole lot cleaned up, most of them arrested and the first saboteur, a certain fry, falls down from the torch of the statue of liberty. that one won't fry on the old electric sparking chair. but hitchcock is not yet in his habit of having a personal cameo appearance in his own films, so don't look for him. it's well built and well performed, but it is only a propaganda film with an extra style.<br /><br />dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
