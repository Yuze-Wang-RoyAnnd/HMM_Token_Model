1st watched 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (dir - billy wilder): spectacular rendering of lindbergh's famous flight by james stewart as lindbergh and director billy wilder. there isn't really a whole lot of background built into this story but that's ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from lindbergh's perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie. this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well. stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the atlantic. and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before -- which is amazing!! there is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight. the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it's age. i appreciate the fact that they didn't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself. well done throughout. this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all.
