'anne christie' was garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard. she plays the lead character, anna, who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris (a drunken barge owner played by george f marion), and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water.<br /><br />meeting irish matt (charles bickford) may mark the turning point for her ... or does it? garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which, although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace, still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later. marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill, dinner at eight, and emma; while marion and bickford are more than adequate.<br /><br />an interesting slice of movie history. garbo would do better talkies in the years following, but 'anna christie' will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen.
