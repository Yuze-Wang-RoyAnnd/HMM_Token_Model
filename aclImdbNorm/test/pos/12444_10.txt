i can't remember exactly where i heard of them first, but i listen to a little of one song and liked it. went and bought the cd and had finally found the type of music i like. i heard about this video and knew i had to have it. it has a lot of clips from them playing in concert. let me tell you, watching this video doesn't even compare to them in concert. i've seen them twice in concert and don't want to ever miss a chance to see them again. the other two things it has is some interview, and even a video for one of their biggest songs. couple little side notes...i saw them at ozzfest 2001 and they ruled there, but seeing them in a smaller inside stage was much better (they had some really cool things to do with being able to cut out the lights) the other, in case anyone wonders, votary means a devout follower.
