although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute, it holds a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint. i tend to believe it is the scriptwriter- grant morris (see dead dog), who, despite the warped plot line injected a fantastic slice of humour, sorely missing in many of today's box office hits. definitely a must see for a sunday afternoon laughfest. speaking as a true single girl, and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly, but did ignite a small flame of hope for a lovelife. not my lovelife, so much as my slightly crazy neighbour's lovelife who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her. she may find someone.
