i was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising barney this much after the fifth grade?<br /><br />okay, everyone hates barney. okay, i think his voice and songs are annoying. okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. i'm fourteen years old, so i know well enough. but here's the thing. kids? they love this show.<br /><br />when i was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. face it, that's how toddlers are. even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. there's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into.<br /><br />and then came barney. i don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. i know i did. i was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. i learned my abcs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. i'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least i was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break.<br /><br />my nieces and nephew all went through the barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. i know what keeps barney on the air. he entertains. of course there's big bird, ernie, and oscar, and they're great, too. but at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. and that's enough for me.
