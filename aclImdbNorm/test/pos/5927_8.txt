i have watched this film several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience. as a retired airline pilot, i am interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the better ones. i know that lindbergh was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to paris and that james stewart was almost 50 when making this movie but i can overlook that fact because stewart has always been one of my all-time favorite actors and does one of his usual outstanding performances as the "lone eagle".<br /><br />there is a good mixture of comedy and drama throughout the film and a good use of flashbacks. it also helps that james stewart was a pilot in real life both in the military and civilian life.
