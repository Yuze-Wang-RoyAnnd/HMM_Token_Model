boogie nights is full of surprises, nothing quite prepares one for it its soul. yes, it does have soul, whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter, with both a wry smile and respect. brillantly cast and wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style.<br /><br />the plot proved richer than i expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each "b grade" human being is brought, through crisis, into perspective.<br /><br />a sociologist's dream case study, the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem, parental love and lack of it, attention/love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. something for everyone here.. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal.<br /><br />the film works on a number of levels. the ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur, who happens to be watching the film...<br /><br />boogie nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters, a rarity. it deserves every accolade it has achieved and more.
