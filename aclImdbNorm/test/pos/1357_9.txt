this is the last episode of the goldenboy ova series. kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. besides episode 3, this was probably the least risqu'e, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. my only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well, leaving us with the nice feeling that kentaro is permanently 25, studying on. definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through, you can buy the whole series for like $17, you can watch it all the way through in about 2 1/2 hours, or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time (which i do if i have a lunch break at school.) good series, check it out.
