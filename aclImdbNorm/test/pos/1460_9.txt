there are only a few movies which can be called `must see' and shephered is one of those films. in many ways it was ahead of it's time (and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better-known films) copied by many, equaled by none, this truly is one great movie.<br /><br />the story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. the story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns. c. thomas howell is a `shepherd' one who protects the populace for various religious leaders by killing off any unfit members of the society. the whole idea made me think about our society. it's really a brilliant social commentary, which is more than i can say for certain recent sci-fi/action blockbusters. matrix reloaded and revolutions didn't make one feel that any real innovation was taking place, just dull video-game effects. but shepherd scores on the action scale too...<br /><br />not once does this movie let the viewer catch their breath. peter hayman proves himself to be one of the few genius action directors. we're talking 100%, high grade, down home kung fu fighting! it was excellent. really good special effects, shoot-outs, bleak-futuristic cyber-punk noir style
