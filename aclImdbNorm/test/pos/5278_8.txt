rendered in beautiful water colors, ponyo at the cliff is definitely a sight to behold, vaguely remembering the trailer, witch i didn't find that impressive, i was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was. this film just washed over me with its purity.<br /><br />at the center is a young boy that comes into contact with a sea creature, and its their relationship that carries the movie. miyazaki is a master both at creating memorable imagery and showing young ones interacting in a believable way with their little quirks intact.<br /><br />there are a few parts that didn't sit well with me. it would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene "resembled" ride of the valkyrians, its a shame because such a precious film as this cant afford to take liberties and it hurt a otherwise truly great scene. the antagonist and its back-story never interested me either, but i guess it served more as a background then anything else.<br /><br />anyway, great film. the boat trip scenario with all its imagery and sea-creatures stood out me thinks. pure and magical. and yes, handrawn artwork is more intimate then computer animated, i'm really pumped for princes and the frog now.
