i must say i'm an avid horror movie fan, and currently i can't get enough of foreign horror. since us horror really depends too much on gore.<br /><br />this movie is fantastic. this movie reminded me a lot of m. night's sixth sense. the way the film was directed was great. the director took his time to set everything up. it took about a good 40 mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie. i thought the movie was just a drama. this movie just builds up and the pay off isn't too much.<br /><br />i've never done this before, but this is the main reason i liked the movie.... i actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me... which is kinda pathetic.... but for a film to do that, it's great.
