let me just start out by saying that tourist trap is a better movie then 99.9% of the horror films that have come out of hollywood lately. if you don't believe me see darkness falls or they. and it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like stab, bleed, the pool, and so on. one of the big problems with the film tourist trap is that is never really found an audience. when the film opened in 1979 it was given a pg rating by the mpaa. anyone that knows horror films knows that a pg on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film. (director david schmoeller talks about this problem on the dvd's commentary track.) there are exceptions though like poltergeist, which had also received a pg rating. however, there are big differences between tourist trap and poltergeist. tourist trap was not a big budget hollywood film like poltergeist nor was it produced by steven spielberg. that alone was enough to guarantee poltergeist success. (still for those of you that have seen tourist trap, you will even scratch your head as to why the mpaa rated this film pg. the 'heart burst' scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and r rating. or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it.) i have to admit though that when i was young i looked at a copy of poltergeist in the video store shelf, picked it up, saw that it was rated pg and put it back on the shelf in favor of an r rated film instead. years later, i finally saw poltergeist and realized what a great film i missed out on for not renting a pg horror film. from then on i would never judge a film based on it's rating again. this is most likely what happened to tourist trap. people, like me with poltergeist, will probably overlook it in favor of the r rated film. most likely it would be a teenager too, which most of these types of films are targeted at. friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated r and was heavily advertised by paramount at the time. it found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels. when you look at it folks, tourist trap is just as good as friday the 13th. the same thing could've happened to tourist trap. we could have seen tourist trap 2, 3, 4, and so on. as far as the film goes, tourist trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget, but it is well acted, well directed and well made on many levels. chuck connors is a riot as mr. slausen and gives the best performance in the film. special credit must be give to composer pino donaggio, whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness. the music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy. donaggio worked on the horror film carrie and many other film scores since tourist trap. he has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day. the weakness with tourist trap is that there really is never any explanation of davey's powers. maybe that is how it's supposed to be. he just has them, and we should accept that in order for the movie to work. we do accept it to a point, but then the screenplay has incidents like how davey makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. in that case, is davey limited in using his powers? can he make a phone ring in houston, detroit, los angeles? what is his range? those are things that people that didn't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws. others would accept it as a mistake. i accept it. there is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it. this is a horror film. we should not be required to read too much into it. many people have called this the 'killer mannequin' movie. i assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film. the mannequins are controlled by the power of davey who uses them as a weapon. this is a common misconception about this film. some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly. i think they add to the overall creepiness of the film. overall tourist trap is a good fun rental.***(out of 5)
