this is a funny, clever film and well worth your time. in my opinion it is much better than american pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time. i hadn't heard of this film, so i guess it didn't get much press, which is kind of a shame. it doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important...as opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his d**k in a pie, but in the end everyone gets laid and whoop-de-do... one thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy american pop-punk...they actually had real punk from back in the day like the ramones...that in itself made the film better! to be honest i wasn't expecting much from this film and i was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is.
