first of all, i must say that i love this film.<br /><br />it was the first film that i saw from director micheal haneke and i was impressed that how good the direction was good !<br /><br />haneke surely knows how to direct actors. what i found intresting is also haneke's scenario. at first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. then you realise that she has a mother who is a controle freak and is too much present in her life. now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. and then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. she can't controled herself anymore.<br /><br />the roles are very complexed and difficult to play, but isabelle huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at cannes festival. benoit maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by huppert's performance.<br /><br />there is one thing that i found strange in the scenario is how the character played by magimel is not very credible. he is too talented! it is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study... it think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw.<br /><br />i just saw the movie once, so i can't do a very complete critic, because i didn't analysed the movie. i like what i saw ! so i give the film a 8.5/10<br /><br />oh yeah... as for the end, haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. a motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies, but haneke does it with style and precision, that is why his film is better than baise-moi for example.<br /><br />vince
