i've read the comments on las vegas and do agree with some of them, it's not brain surgery tv, but then again i was under the impression that tv was mainly for escapism, especially with what is going on in today's world. let's face it, a show about vegas (that isn't a reality based programme) isn't going to one based on reality because to me vegas is pure fantasy! it's the sort of place where we can go and pretty much do what we want when we want (subject to funds obviously!).<br /><br />therefore the fact that las vegas is pretty, sexy and cliched with characters that reflect all this seems to be on the money in my eyes. if you don't like it, don't watch it, that what we have a million channels for!<br /><br />we're coming up to the third episode here in the uk and i know that i will be making a beeline to watch it again. i just hope it's not cancelled, something that seems to be happening a lot with most of the shows that come to the uk that are half decent! (firefly and jake 2.0 anyone?!!).<br /><br />it's harmless, great looking fun and everytime i watch it, i want to go back to the real thing :)
