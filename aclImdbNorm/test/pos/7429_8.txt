a young girl becomes a war-time marine's pen-pal, and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more "available," comic complications ensue. all ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. errol flynn's dead-on impression of humphrey bogart from "casablanca" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot). it is tucker, though, who "tucks" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in "f-troop" and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little patti brady charms as tucker's actual pen-pal friend. a fine, lightweight "coming home" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.
