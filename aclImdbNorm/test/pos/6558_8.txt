anyone who enjoys the lynchian weirdness of twin peaks, or any fan of hp lovecraft who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar things, will really enjoy this film. don't watch it as a horror film in the "traditional" western sense, but more like a grimm's fairy tale. it is gory and definitely for 16+, but once you start watching it, you too will find yourself drawn into the vortex. definitely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching (i'll never look at my snails the same way again!)
