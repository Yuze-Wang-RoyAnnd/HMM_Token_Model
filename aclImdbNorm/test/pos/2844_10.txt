i've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. it impressed me so much that i kept on smiling the whole day after i watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when i took the movie as the final taste of the festival. what i knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that ren'ee zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. but what i saw was much more than that! splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock `and ren'ee zellweger. a strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. and for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track. many soap-opera-lovers will love 'nurse betty' - the movie as well as the character!!! - but they can bring all there non-soap friends, 'cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the cruel scenes, the thriller-aspects and for the beautiful pictures. and i'm quite sure that at the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm!!!
