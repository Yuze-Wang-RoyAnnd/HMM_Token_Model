when i read the synopsis for "messiah" in the television guide, i was not prepared for what was in store. the story follows dci metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london. he soon realises a pattern, there is a serial killer on the loose, killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to their matching apostle. the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat, with metcalfe closely pursuing the killer, but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill-fated victim. "messiah" is sure to cause a great deal of controversy, but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time.
