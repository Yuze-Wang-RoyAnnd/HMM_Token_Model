don't mind what this socially retarded person above says, this show is hilarious. it shows how a lot of single men are in a bar atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think they are. <br /><br />the contest aspect of the how is really cool and original. its not the standard reality show that we are all used to now a days.<br /><br />give it a chance everyone, we are only one episode in, we finally have some canadian programming that isn't absolute crap. as canadians what do we normally get, bon cop, bad cop, or corner gas. come on people show that we are all not as prudish as the previous reviewer.<br /><br />way to go comedy network, giving a new show a chance. the panel is funny and the contestants so far are pretty good.
