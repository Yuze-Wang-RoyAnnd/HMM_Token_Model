there are not many films which i would describe as perfect, but rififi definitely fits the bill. no other heist film has come close to it, before or after. the plot is simple, but engrosses you. it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. you care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. it's hard to imagine any other actor besides jean servais in the role of tony le st'ephanois. when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony, his answer and the expression on his face says it all. while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie(and rightfully so)the film actually gets better afterward.the director jules dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout, but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony's final ride towards his destiny. to think that if dassin, an american director, had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france, this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was. it certainly wouldn't have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time. it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through, but he did achieve his greatest work because of it, to the benefit of all of us. i'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake. most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another. there's no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money. leave the classics alone!
