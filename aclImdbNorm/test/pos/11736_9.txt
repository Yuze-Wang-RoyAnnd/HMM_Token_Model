i always loved that scratchy voiced guy in all those westerns. he was the sidekick (jingles) in the wild bill hickock show back in the fifties. in this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character. he is harmless and no one believes him, but he is non-flustered and goes on anyway. when you have a guy like this, there's no challenging because the details aren't there to quibble with. of course, in this episode, he is taken on board a space ship by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear. they don't have the word lie in their vocabularies. as it turns out, he is so insufferable that they can't handle him; and then, of course, there is the secret weapon. see this just to watch andy.
