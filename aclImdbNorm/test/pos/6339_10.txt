excellent episode, showed dean has not only good taste by picking cassie for his girlfriend but also shows he does have a heart and can love just one woman, and he's not just some guy who loves and leaves em! aweso e episode. applaud them on this one. i only hope that some way they go back to the cassie relationship next season (if there is a next season??) i would like to see her come back into their "supernatural" lives especially dean's. also i like the fact the chose an african-american woman to be the special lady in his life that got away somehow. i hope they don't screw that up and end it as he episdoe ended. the girl who played cassie was truly a looker and it was good to see the wb branching out into what we all see in everyday life-the interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable(finally!)
