this movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. you'll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain (the breather), a female batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. not by any means a great cinematic achievement. but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing. god help me, i liked it.
