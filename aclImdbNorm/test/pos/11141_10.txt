i loved this movie because bobbie phillips can really fight! i always hate when actors are not believable in action parts. it was great to see, no offense, but a woman who can skillfully perform martial arts and fighting. if you compare this with most action movies with females you will definitely see what i mean. they don't have to cut up the shots with someone that can fight and it flows better. i was very impressed. i hope there's more!
