i thought this movie was great, not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast. i read that drew barrymore wasn't exceptional as josie geller because she is beautiful. yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself, which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world. the story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, i for sure am. david arquette is mad as her brother rob, and michael vartan is gorgeous as sam coulson. leelee sobieski did an excellent job as her mate aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. i think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a "teeny boppy" flick
