i'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic, but i was so enthralled by it that i really didn't care. the movie plays out like a fun, lighthearted teen romp combined with a schwarzenegger-type action flick. it's packed with action, packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well. sean astin is fun to watch, and i haven't seen louis gossett, jr. since i saw "diggstown" in theaters. he is a fine, underrated actor and i love watching him on screen. i just wonder what he's doing now. unfortunately, he might be starring in a lot of those direct-to-video flicks. hopefully, my assumption is wrong. anyway, this is a fun, edge-of-your-seat thriller and i definitely suggest you check it out. <br /><br />my score: 7 (out of 10)
