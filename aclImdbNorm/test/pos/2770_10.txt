i'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. all who love this movie should email disney and increase the demand for it. they'd eventually have to sell it then. i'd buy copies for everybody i know. everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and i haven't figured out why disney hasn't put this movie on dvd or on vhs in rental stores. at least i haven't seen any copies. this is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. the kids in the new generation don't get to see it and i think they should. it should at least be put back on the channel. this movie doesn't deserve a cheap download. it deserves the real thing. i'm emailing them now. this movie will be on dvd.
