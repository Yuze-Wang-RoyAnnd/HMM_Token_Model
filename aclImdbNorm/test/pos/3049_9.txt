this film had me spellbound this evening. thanks to fox movie classics for showing it uninterrupted. john voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a sunday evening. how wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as paul winfield's excellent portrayal of mad billy. i can't see why anyone would say that hume cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. who would they have chosen? the shrill character actor, charles lane? although his career is laudable, an actor such as lane would have cheapened the role. cronyn was an excellent choice for the part. i will count this film as a true treasure to hold in memory.
