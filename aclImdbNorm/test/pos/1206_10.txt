i have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time i watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! george berger (played by treat williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war "hippies" living at large in new york city. this small group happens upon a young man, claude bukowski (played by john savage) who has been drafted into the us army for service in vietnam. despite their best efforts to dissuade him, claude does eventually report for basic training in the army. still distressed over his having left them, the hippie group steal a car and travel across the usa to visit claude "...for a couple of hours," in the words of george berger (to an m.p. stationed at the entry gate of the army base claude is temporarily stationed at in nevada). the outcome is truly touching, so i won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie. the musical score is equally fantastic! don dacus (of the rock group chicago), who plays the part of "woof" - one of the hippies, is a not a key character, but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. beverly d'angelo (who plays sheila franklin, an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group) is sensational in her role! a must see film!!
