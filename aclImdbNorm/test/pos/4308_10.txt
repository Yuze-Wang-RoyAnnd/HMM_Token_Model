"m"ullers b"uro" is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the end, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. it is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles batman's gotham city (look carefully at the streets, buildings, the police car chasing the criminals, etc.). it is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as m"uller's secretary and vitasek's (the actor playing m"uller's assistant) lover who do their best to sing, albeit not very successfully.<br /><br />the spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent blue box (there is a real club with this name in vienna) where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background, m"uller's apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen, m"uller's bureau with the sweet picture of his assistant, etc.<br /><br />the humorous moments in the movie are many and include "flat in the face" type of humor such as m"uller farting in his assistant's face, the prostitute charging m"uller extra for orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of montana, etc.<br /><br />a legendary film from the 80's especially for those interested in austrian or german-speaking cinema.
