a beautiful film, cleverly shot with an eye to war-era detail, and (considering it is set during wwii) minimal violence.<br /><br />a small cast weaves an emotive journey through the occupation of czechoslovakia, the separation from loved ones as the pilots depart for england (the separation from the spaniel will touch hearts), spitfire scenes, love, friendship and betrayal. the theme of betrayal runs deep through the movie, from betrayal of love, to betrayal of friendship, and finally the betrayal shown by the communist regime to former raf pilots post-war.<br /><br />a desperately sad film, all the more so because it is so factually accurate. i would recommend it to everyone.
