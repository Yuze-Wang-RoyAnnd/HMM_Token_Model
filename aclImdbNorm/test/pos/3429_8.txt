...and this movie easily exceeded my expectations. the fact that it is written and directed by peter dalle led me to believe it was in style with other films i'm used to (and bored with) seeing him in. anyway, i grudgingly went along to see this flick and that i'm glad for. this stuff has humour and depth. 9 out of 10. see it!
