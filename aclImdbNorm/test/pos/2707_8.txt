the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter's complex life. though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.<br /><br />cynthia gibb (portrays karen) was not a fine election. she is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter. i think that the role needed a stronger character. someone with a stronger personality.<br /><br />louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as karen's mother.<br /><br />it has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. unfortunately they weren't, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries
