i've enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do. i also liked batman forever back then but the real difference is that this movie didn't date when i grew up. i did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'hhmm... the crowd is angry. hey! where did they get those tomatoes from?' then i thought: 'who cares? this movie is not 100% serious anyway!'<br /><br />the original tim burton batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and i didn't like all the actors. this movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more gothic style and no involvement of prince. <br /><br />nowadays, many fans of the christopher nolan movies dislike burton claiming that the nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. i don't think this is entirely true: -there has never been an adaptation of the original concept of batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with batman & robin). a director is free to choose what kind of batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.<br /><br />my opinion: batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. it's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.<br /><br />i just recently watched the nolan movies and i love those ones as well (especially the dark knight). there's simply something about this movie that interests me more. nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of batman. that's a bit too much for me, i'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of batman. the burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.<br /><br />my conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the nolan with the burton movies. they're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. my respect is for both directors.
