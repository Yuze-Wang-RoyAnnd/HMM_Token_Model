this is the best work i have ever seen on television. the story is compelling--all the more so because it is true. the writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented. the acting is great. this has to be the best role sam waterston has ever had. and the black and white cinematography was exceptional. my only regret is that it is not available to buy. a few years ago i contacted someone involved with the production (either with pbs or in england) and was told they had no plans to release it on vhs (at the time). this was a bbc production and ran in the u.s. on american playhouse. there is such an interest in seeing this--just hard to believe no one can make it available.
