"the cell" is a rather difficult film to classify. if you read the plot outline, "a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. but that doesn't really do this movie justice. there is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. there is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. and there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona. the movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. while i feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, i find it to be completely fascinating.<br /><br />right from the opening credits, with lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her "patients", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. the costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. the camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. the characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. if you don't enjoy anything else about "the cell", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.<br /><br />the casting is top notch also. jennifer lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. she is incredibly sexy and i personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. vince vaughn is fairly convincing as an fbi agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. but it is without a doubt vincent d'onofrio that has the biggest impression here. it's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. we are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. he looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. it's a great performance from an underrated actor.<br /><br />while "the cell" doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.
