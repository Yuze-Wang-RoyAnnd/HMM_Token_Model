this film is completely underrated.<br /><br />it's a film similar to will keenan and patrick hasson's waiting, as well as adrien brody's restaurant and the classic film breaking away, which are all about young adults who are stuck and know they're stuck, with little or no chance of breaking free.<br /><br />death by pizza (delivered) is about an intelligent, free-thinking, artistic young adult (will, played by david strictland) who is stuck and waiting, bitter at the world's hypocrisy and bitter at his own lack of direction and desire. will meets his nemesis, reed (ron eldard), another intelligent young adult who's so bitter, he's chosen the path of crime. both end up helping each other to free themselves of their bitterness, which enables them to get unstuck.<br /><br />for these young adults, getting unstuck, or, breaking free, can mean both forging ahead into life, and plunging downward into death.<br /><br />will's life is filled with the trademarks of a young "stuck" adult: a soul-sucking, sweaty, under-paying job, crude customers, an ex-girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial college education with no degree, a house filled with self-made art, and of course the new friend whose ungodly choices help him to save himself.
