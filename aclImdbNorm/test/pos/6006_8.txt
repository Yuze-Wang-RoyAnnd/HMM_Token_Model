i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high. i was riveted to it! i loved the special effects, the fantastic places and the trial-aspect and flashback method of telling the story.<br /><br />several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say, i think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary, as a story the movie is better. it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whatever.<br /><br />it's much more arresting when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway. as a side note, when i saw laputa i was stunned. it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game (1995) that also made me like this mini-series even more.<br /><br />i saw it again about 4 years ago, and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much. really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps mini-series for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland.
