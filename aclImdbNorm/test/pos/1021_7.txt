an enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here, i was a bit disappointed. the period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. and without that, nada. the sub-plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot - all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which surely suggests a fundamental flaw. when all your sub-plots look like padding, you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits. nevertheless, it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place, there are some fine performances, and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut!' that good feeling permeates the film. and that has to count for something. a flawed really quite good movie. 7 out of 10.
