i loved this moviee well i loved the romance part with colby and the girl...rachel (?) 4got her name....i honestly was only interested in those too. i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that. but please no more sad endings where they cant be 2gether! =( it made me cry! but the romance between them. the plot the trauma everything was great. =) i just was more into colby and rachel. ha ha =) everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat. because i sure was. honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple (colby and rachel) and at least a decent ending. i hated the ending, a better one could have been more thought out, not the fact of forcing colby to his death and rachel having a son. the ending would have killed the movie.
