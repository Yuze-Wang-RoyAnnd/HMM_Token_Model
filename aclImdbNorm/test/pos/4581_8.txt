one cannot help but admire mike judge for his hands on "i've experienced that" approach. with "office space", almost anyone working a job could associate with the characters. "idiocracy" has exactly the same feel to it. one can easily appreciate the 505 years later experience of our heroes, because again, the director has tried to put things on a very human level. somewhat similar to woody allen's "sleeper", this movie is very funny. do not miss the deleted scenes as the "museum of fart" is a classic. imaginative comedy is a rarity, and "idiocracy" is wildly imaginative, extremely funny, and a solid 8.0 movie experience. - merk
