this movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. accepted, is the story of a kid named bartleby (justin long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. his parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. so, bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. but behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the american educational system. the college they create "south harmon institute of technology" accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else. the message is that you do not need "money, tradition, or fancy books- you just need a desire to better yourself." they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the movie teaches is that thats still ok- and different (whether its a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves- despite whether they are 'weird.' its a message of non-comformity and has traces of anti-authority sprinkled in as well. but not only are messages great- its hilarious! haha i laughed very hard. the humor can be subtle but can also be blatant as well, and is a great mix. fraternities beware.
