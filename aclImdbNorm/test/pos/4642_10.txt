for a movie that was pg, this is one fun film. i grew up on watching this film over and over. its really fun, i don't know how today audience would react, but if you grew up on it, or loved the 80s, then this is a great film. stephen furst is great as harold, who, i think, is one of the best characters in the film. paul ruebens also pops in for about 10 minutes. i love nostalgia.
