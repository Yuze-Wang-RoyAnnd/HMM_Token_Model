this movie is about carlos "the jackal" (quinn), an international terrorist who, by cia agent henry fields's (sutherland) description, appears to maim women and children for the heck of it. at least that's what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez (quinn again) into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb. ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis. he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos.<br /><br />the movie isn't all shoot-gun-jump-around action, and that's a good thing. in its first half, ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos, and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks. an israeli agent (kingsley), joins fields in training ramirez, and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirez's new character. ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes, to act on the split second like carlos would, and even to make love like carlos (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of carlos's). naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie. it's a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos-wannabe.<br /><br />another thing i liked about this movie was that it didn't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies - you know, the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin's family. ramirez's family does come into the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life.<br /><br />good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley. an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirez's first name (annibal, annabelle, get it?). also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is. in my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn't able to match the build-up.<br /><br />on the whole, the movie was enjoyable. i'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout.<br /><br />my rating: 9/10
