this is an engrossing woman's drama that men can enjoy. the plot follows a young woman (hope lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. we can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor (hey, it's hollywood) and a few other flaws. here is one of the few films in which once big time producer robert evans (here, beautifully depicting a rat with women) appears. it also features a mature joan crawford and terrific supporting cast. check it out.
