i watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important is to care the natur and the wild life. when i got a dog in 83, i called him truska ( in movie..avakun's dog ) to never forget this movie. <br /><br />by the way, i have a copy this movie, but is in portuguese language and the quality is not so good like a dvd or a new vhs ( i recorded almost 20 years ago and in slp speedy.. so the quality is not so good..)<br /><br />if somebody wish a copy.. i'll try convert to dvd and i can send for you ok?<br /><br />ot's a great movie and i agree that is a movie to be always watched.<br /><br />waldemar braz - sao paulo/brazil
