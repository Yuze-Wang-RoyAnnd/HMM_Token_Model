hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the chappelle show/charlie murphy, but also to the character daywalker). but i'll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! <br /><br />let's start with the good things! the quote "strong bloody violence" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. this is not a movie for kids! or for the faint of hearted! it has blade as a central character (wesley snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. the action scenes are great here too.<br /><br />ok over to the things i didn't like. the overall story is too thin. it's enough as i've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. and a character like blade deserves more (imo). the drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clich'es doesn't help. some characters are underwritten ... that's that! :o)
