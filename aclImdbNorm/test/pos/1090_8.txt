i almost stopped watching hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. one exception for this is ramgopal verma movies. this is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. this is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. the adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.you should watch this movie for nana patekar. based on the life of mumbai cop daya naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. the film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist. i rate this as one of the best movie of the year
