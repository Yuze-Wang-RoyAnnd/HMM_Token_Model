wallace & gromit have been around for some time, but this was their first foray onto the silver screen. fans of the british tv series, like myself, were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters. much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original. in a world of cg movies like shrek and toy story, this stop-motion film is a nice alternative to the trend in children's movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon. plus, compared to much earlier stop-motion films (such as king kong and the ray harryhausen films such as sinbad), the quality and movement of the characters are light years better--looking very fluid, natural and more alive.<br /><br />apart from the quality of the animation, this movie also deserves kudos on every other level. first, the voice actors do a great job. second, the script is very simple but also very cute and enjoyable--with a few double-entendres that should probably go way over the kids' heads. third, they manage to make this not only a movie for kids but people of all ages as the film is neither saccharine nor aimed solely at the younger crowd. in particular, i was captivated by incredibly cute the film was--and especially the adorable bunnies. i especially liked them in the closing credits--which made me very happy i stayed to watch the entire film.<br /><br />the bottom line is that unless you are a real stick-in-the-mud, you will enjoy this film. it's fresh, funny and amazingly clever. i hope we see a sequel--and this is saying something, as i usually hate sequels.
