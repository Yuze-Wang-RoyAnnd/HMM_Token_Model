it's not as good as the movie, that said it's a cute kids show. okay so the emperor has back slide and become a selfish spoiled brat once more, accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something entertaining. it has plenty of jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children. also it boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie. earth kitt who has been in numerous films but i'm sure many people know as catwoman. and patrick walburton (sorry if i misspelled) who also has appeared in many films and tv series but is most widely recognized as the tick. it's really a rare and wonderful combination. if for no other reason i highly recommend comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo. to sum up, entertaining children's show, with plenty of inside jokes for the grown-ups to laugh along with. if your looking for educational value this isn't your show. if your just looking for something funny this is a great saturday morning pick!
