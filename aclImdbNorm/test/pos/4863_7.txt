there are moments when you don't want those deep drama-series. when you don't want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on. there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series, with lots of action and cool characters. for those moments, you have cleopatra 2525.<br /><br />i was one of those who actually enjoyed charlie's angels. critics said it was to superficial and silly. but the thing is, that's the point! people who can't relax and expected a serious movie hated it. it's exactly the same with cleopatra 2525. it is superficial. it has silly and unrealistic characters. and that's why i like it. it isn't like any other series.<br /><br />the first season wasn't very good. the character cleo was irritating and a little too much. the story was a little lame, and you didn't get to know the characters very much. but hey, they only had 20 minutes in every episode.<br /><br />in the last 5-6 episodes of cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series full 40-minutes length. and it was here i started to love it. the series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series. too bad they had to cancel the series. because the last episodes of cleopatra 2525 actually was very good. i will never forget hel, sarge and cleo. unique characters that only the creators of xena could have created!
