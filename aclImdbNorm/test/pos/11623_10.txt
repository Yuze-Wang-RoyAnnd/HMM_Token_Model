recently finally available in dvd (11/11/08), severo p'erez' film...and the earth did not swallow him (1994) is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in chicano literature. tom'as rivera's ...y no se lo trag'o la tierra/ ...and the earth did not devour him (1972) is still generally acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic chicano novel. originally written in the spanish characteristic of south texas and also translated into english, rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence within the chicano literary landscape. <br /><br />perez' film, originally made as a highly-rated american playhouse pbs production has taken some time to be released in dvd. one can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not an issue. the film, and now dvd, however, remains, so far as i know, the only cinematic adaptation of any chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to earth's incredible staying power. this cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep-rooted nerve that is, i maintain, both specifically ethnic, yet also generally universal. doubts about earth perhaps might have arisen because it is too "ethnic," too alien from a basic american mainstream, too much a "foreign" art indie, too limited in economic resources. yet, perez in his version of art, in my opinion connects very effectively, artistically, and creates a sharply-etched portrayal of a chicano migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life. as far as a production done with relatively limited economic resources, its lovely cinematographic work and haunting music go much beyond its available funding. simply viewing the film makes manifest this film's (or dvd) artistic value.<br /><br />briefly,
