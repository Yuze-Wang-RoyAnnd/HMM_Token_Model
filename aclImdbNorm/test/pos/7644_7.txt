i watched this movie on hbo and i had a good time.<br /><br />the director has done a great work. i found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started. norman reedus's performance is cool. i expect more chilling movies from him.<br /><br />i was so absorbed that on occasions i wanted to grab gun from norman and shoot that snake girl. hehe. i like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunningly. the ending was what i wanted :)) <br /><br />this movie is filled with twists of moments. you expect this but something else happens. <br /><br />in the beginning, those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyes.<br /><br />although it was not shown when norman reedus changed currency notes? or is it me standing by fridge. :)
