i first saw this film on cable in the 80's and it rocked me to the core. it showed up again on tv about six months ago.<br /><br />filmed on location, the black and white cinematography graphically portrays 1950's new york as the gritty "urban jungle" at a time when there was far more industry and port activity in the city, particularly in manhattan.<br /><br />john cassavetes always brought a special intensity to his acting, and is magnificent in the role of the army dodger. his brief 1959 tv series "johnny staccato" is also a joy to watch.<br /><br />sidney poitier and (later in the film) ruby dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. but it is jack warden's superb acting as the vicious, brutal shift boss that grabbed my attention. to get an idea of warden's versatility, watch this film, then check out a 1962 episode of the tv series "naked city" entitled "specter of the rose street gang (available on video)." if you are a fan of film noir, this is a must see. enjoy!
