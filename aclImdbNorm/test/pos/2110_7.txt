first i am a teenager. ok, and i have to say this movie was pretty good. i think any kid ten and under will like it, but people my age an up might be a little, um, a, well, we'd describe the movie as lame! but i liked it. it may be that i still act like a kid, or i visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. i did like how the actors were like kids, not little blonde cutesy pies, wearing three layers of clothes, a trendy hat, and about a thousand assecories (like most shows today, to name a few, drake & josh, lizzie mc guire, well any kid show.) and the setting was perfect, but there was a flaw. the family was in debt, right? why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a "western" versace store? that was one flaw.<br /><br />the cameos are great, there's about five hundred of them, and the only explainable one is julia roberts being the main little girl's aunt. how in the world did they get everyone else? this movie seemed to be on a tight type budget.<br /><br />i liked this movie, it was a fun one to watch, and i thought some parts were far fetched (like a cow selling for $750,000? ha! my butt a cow sells for that much!) but otherwise it was good, i liked it, and i could watch it again. but i'd never buy it, there's not even special features on the dvd! what's up with that? but do rent it, especially if you have little kids running around the house.
