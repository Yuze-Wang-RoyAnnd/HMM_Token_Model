hooray for korean cinema! last year i saw "chungyang" and "nowhere to hide", now i catch up with hur jin-ho's directorial debut "christmas in august". the variety of themes and level of achievement speak highly of a national cinema ripe for discovery. this film's major themes are death and love. the graceful and thoughtful way jung won(han suk-kyu) copes with his impending death, and the sublimation of his desires toward darim(shim eun-ha) out of true love for her. i was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, shielding darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting her.<br /><br />the success of this type of film is predicated on the skill of the actors. han and shim excel, being both quite expressive yet naturalistic. a number of secondary characters, jung won's relatives, friends, and clients, are quickly delineated to enrich the story without detracting from its main focus. to live is to love, but all things must pass. pain subsides. life goes on.
