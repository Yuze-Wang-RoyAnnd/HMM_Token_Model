a powerful movie that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the burmese people against their tyrants. i felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, together with a bit of rage because i feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, is doing anything effective to end this shame. i think these feelings became directly from the movie, and that they were intended when it was made, so it is a successful movie. the desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. in fact it is the buddhist burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators. but, how can you feel angry about these poor people?
