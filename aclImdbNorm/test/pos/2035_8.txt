rock star is a well-told hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob halford's replacement for judas priest. mark wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nights.<br /><br />stephen herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the hair-metal rock god. wahlberg's "izzy" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal "goat horn" hand-sign several times over.<br /><br />the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. more interaction with these life-long rock musicians would have amplified and solidified izzy's new surroundings. <br /><br />naturally, rock star is filled with great music. rabin's score, the steel dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have! let's all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very-needed revival.
