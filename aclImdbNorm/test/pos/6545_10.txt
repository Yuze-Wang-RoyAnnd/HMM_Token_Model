i remember watching this movie many years ago on vhs at a friends place. at first i thought it would be a boring car movie. but much to my surprise it ended up being one of the best movies i can remember watching for its time.<br /><br />it has a good story line and best of all it has some awesome aussie cars and street racing. i really loved fox's car the most which was a worked dodge charger. the paint work which was done on this car was truly outstanding in my opinion :)!<br /><br />there's also a black two door blown 57 chev which comes into the movie later on. <br /><br />i actually managed to get a copy of this movie on vhs last year at k-mart over here in australia. i did have plans of converting this movie to dvd myself as i believe it is a movie worth the conversion. but much to my surprise this weekend while i was browsing the dvd movie bin i came across it on dvd. so of course i grabbed it while i could as it was the only copy there.<br /><br />anyway if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars, including a great story line without a rice burner in sight. then this movie is for you!!!!<br /><br />here is some additional info taken from the back of the dvd.<br /><br />he'll win at any cost fox is a young man that lives in the fast lane. he believes he is the fastest man on the road - but street racing is illegal. if he doesn't accept his latest challenge he could loose his girl... if he does accept, he could lose his life. living dangerously, living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession. they don't turn back, the don't give in.. and the don't ask for help.
