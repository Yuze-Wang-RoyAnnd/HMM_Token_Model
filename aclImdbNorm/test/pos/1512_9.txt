fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors. he is also a very good story teller mixing horror, the supernatural, and psychedelic themes altogether very well. this film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as "voices from beyond". the story is simple as fulci plays himself, a horror director. after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered. he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing people.<br /><br />fulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time. these films i don't believe he directed but certainly produced. some of those films are "massacre" directed by andrea bianchi (burial ground), "touch of death" directed by fulci, "the murders secret" and i can't remember the rest of the films.<br /><br />nightmare concert is a very underrated film, even by fulci fans. but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already. it is sad that fulci didn't get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
