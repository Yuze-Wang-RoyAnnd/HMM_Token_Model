one of warner brothers best and highest grossing films during the thirties was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with his maiden sister raising four daughters. but not four every day type daughters. all of them have been trained by their musician father on instruments and one as a singer. they do make some beautiful music together even if it is for the long haired set.<br /><br />you can watch the infinite variety of roles that claude rains played over the years and still marvel as he shows you yet another aspect of his creative personality. the opportunistic vichy captain in casablanca is as different as the scientist gone mad in the invisible man, as the patient and wise job in mr. skeffington. all the same man and all so incredibly different.<br /><br />here he raises the four girls with love seasoned with a little grouchiness at their willingness to accept modern music. the lane sisters and gale page may know beethoven, but they're hep cats as well and can beat daddy eight to the bar every time. and if rains gets a bit too testy than aunt may robson can put him in his place.<br /><br />with four daughters unmarried at the time you know that's going to change. all the sisters develop romantic interests in dick foran, frank mchugh, jeffrey lynn, and john garfield. of course the mating process does get a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy, but it does promise to work out as the film ends.<br /><br />four daughters is also known as the debut film of john garfield. other than a tiny bit part in footlight parade years earlier, garfield had no other film roles. but he'd been acclaimed on the new york stage for his performance in golden boy and warner brothers signed him and found the perfect film debut role as the cynical musician who just can't quite get a decent break in life. it earned him a best supporting actor nomination in 1938, but he lost to walter brennan for kentucky.<br /><br />this film was so popular that it practically spawned a small cottage industry for jack warner. sequels with cast members like daughters courageous, four mothers, four wives all cleaned up at the box office before world war ii. and warner brothers remade it with frank sinatra and doris day playing the parts that john garfield and priscilla lane originated. now those two made some beautiful music.<br /><br />still a timeless mold was created in four daughters and the film holds up 70 years after it was first seen.
