the coen brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. though it is based on "the odyssey," the ancient work of homer, you do not have to have read "the odyssey" to be able to follow the story. the brothers coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! the soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. george clooney is magnificent as the grease haired everett ulysses mcgill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. o brother, where art thou is easily the best coen film to date as well as clooney's best effort. clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is tim blake nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a best film nod.
