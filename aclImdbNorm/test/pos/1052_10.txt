"christmas in connecticut" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for christmas! elizabeth lane, a precursor to martha stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. her publisher, mr. alexander yardley (a brilliant comic turn by sydney greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the christmas holiday. only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job. elizabeth's colleague, john, happens to have a farm in connecticut, so that solves that problem. however, he wants to marry liz, but she does not want to marry him. he offers her marriage, though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him that he does about her. he makes the offer anyway, and assures her that he is willing to wait. and here barbara stanwyck, as liz, delivers one of the most devastating put-downs i have ever heard. with perfect innocence, she replies: "could you wait that long?" ouch! in addition, the scenes between una o'conner and s.z. sakall are hilarious. they don't seem to like one another (though one suspects they really do). they are rivals in the household, and s.z. sakall's mangled english is equaled by nora's strangled pronunciation of his name ("mr. basternook"). "my name is felix!" it is amazing how christmas-y these black and white films are. great character work by all involved. don't miss this one!
