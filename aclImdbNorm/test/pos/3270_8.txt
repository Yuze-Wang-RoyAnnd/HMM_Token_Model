jimmy (heath ledger) is given a simple job by pando (bryan brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. jimmy rings pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. pando and his boys try their best to locate jimmy, meaning no more jimmy if they get their hands on him. so now jimmy goes into hiding to organise a bank robbery to get pando's money back. also throughout this mess he meets the innocently sweet alex (rose byrne) and together they're in for one hell of a ride through sydney's king cross.<br /><br />"two hands" is simply an engrossing pick-me-up film that's brisk, exhilarating and incredibly fresh. what you got here is pretty much an urban gangster film with a seedy backdrop and in-your-face violence
