a very different jerry lewis film, not like all those more famous films that everybody knows. lewis deals with the difficult task of ww ii and national socialism in germany in a rather unconventional way. but even more interesting and important, he does it in a very un-american way. and as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry un-american means more sophisticated, more subtle, more intelligent or simply better. that is the reason why the film was no success in the us but a very great success in europe.<br /><br />all in all, jerry lewis has proven by this movie, that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy.
