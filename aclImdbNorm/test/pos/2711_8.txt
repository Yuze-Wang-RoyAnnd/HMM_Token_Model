there is a clever little scene in the karen carpenter story, where both carpenters are in a recording studio, and richard makes an impromptu decision to have karen sing for the owner of the studio.<br /><br />richard picks the wrong key for karen to sing in, so karen is singing above her natural range. you can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. the next thing you hear is karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take. nicely done! for some reason, i have never forgotten that scene.<br /><br />the karen carpenter story chronicles the meteoric rise of the carpenters, and karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. a lot of things are glossed over. this isn't a documentary, and the movie left me with a lot of questions. very little is mentioned of karen's solo venture (the cd was released only a few years ago. if you buy it, you will wonder why they waited. it's some of karen's best work. the songs aren't as timeless as her work with brother richard, but it was a great recording, in my opinion).<br /><br />i have heard it said that, you can be listening to a cheap, time-worn little radio in the middle of the third world, that would seem to produce more static than anything else. but when a carpenter song comes on the radio, you would think you were listening to a $1000 hi-fidelity unit.<br /><br />watch this movie!
