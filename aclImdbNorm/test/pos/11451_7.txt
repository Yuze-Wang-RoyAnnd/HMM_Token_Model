it's the old, old story : kids have a party in an old house, demons are unleashed, death and gratuitous nudity ensues. you all know it, it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />many people (okay, many horror fans, to be specific) have fond memories of this movie and it's always with slight trepidation that you revisit an old movie to see if it's still as good as you used to think it was. luckily, this is.<br /><br />it has something for everyone (well, everyone who happens to be male, i suppose). from a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam involving cunning use of linnea quigley's ass to the "mirror" scene to the full on demonic fun, this is a blast from start to finish.<br /><br />the girls are cute, the guys are . . . . male, the death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and, unlike some horrors from the era, this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension throughout. don't get me wrong, it's still fun first and foremost but it offers some nice, freaky moments that should please most genre fans.
