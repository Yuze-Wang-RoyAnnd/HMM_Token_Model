having watched this film years ago, it never faded from my memory. i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that i've seen. but, i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received. after seeing it once more today, i still think it is powerful, moving and couldn't care less if it is "based loosely on king lear".<br /><br />i now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that i've ever seen - and she has had accolades for much shallower efforts.<br /><br />a thousand acres is complex, human, vibrant and immensely moving, but surely doesn't present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or "sexiness". i don't think this is well received in these times.<br /><br />perhaps one reason for this film's underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer (jane smiley(, screenplay (laura jones), and director (jocelhyn moorehouse) are all women. i know that, in my younger days, i wouldn't have read a book written by a woman. i didn't focus on this fact until years later.<br /><br />if you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past, try watching it anew. maybe you are ready for it.
