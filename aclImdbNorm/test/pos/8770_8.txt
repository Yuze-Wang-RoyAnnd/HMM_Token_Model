a man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire, and must travel cross-country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand. a plot line that was later used to fuel hitchcock's classic north by northwest, saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the master himself.<br /><br />for any hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and charades. here, the likable and charming robert cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters, not withstanding a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives, and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone.<br /><br />in terms of sheer originality and quality, this does lack in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. however, there is some nice chemistry between cummings and his lead lady, the much under-appreciated priscilla lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by vaughn glaser. the best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what hitchcock would use later in north by northwest, only this time the climax is atop a statue in new york. certainly not his best, but the master of suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.
