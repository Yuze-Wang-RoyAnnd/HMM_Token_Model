*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* i found the film amusing.it was weird and i enjoy it,i laughed a lot so the bottom line is that i recommend the film.however i have problems with what labute wanted to say.the plot is very simple.betty(renee zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her "true love" for a soap series character,dr. david ravell (greg kinnear). simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film. and here comes the big question.what is the film all about? the reference to "the wizard of oz" is obvious.betty and dorothy are both from kansas however while dorothy come at the end of that film to the conclusion that "there is no place like home", betty doesn't come to any conclusion and by the end of the film we are left wonder what has she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing.it seems not to affect her at all.<br /><br />than is the film about the different between reality and fantasy? could be,but the scenes that are dealing with this subject are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot line that can take the film to other places.(and by the way "the truman show" dealt with this subject in a much better way).<br /><br />the film could be about obsession.betty is obsessed with the soap series and charlie(morgan freeman) is obsessed with betty.labute show two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession,in any form is dangerous,and should be condemned.he seems to have sympathy to betty's obsession because he sees it as a harmless one.<br /><br />all a long the film we have scenes that in itself could have been a subject for a whole film,but are left for us to think about without that they will have impact on the characters.<br /><br />the ending is simply a make -up that has nothing to do with what we saw before.it's a shame because the film could have been sharper if he would have concentrate in one or two subjects.as it is,it's about a lot but actually say nothing.<br /><br />what we are left with is the feeling that we have seen a little film,amusing and weird that could have been much much more.
