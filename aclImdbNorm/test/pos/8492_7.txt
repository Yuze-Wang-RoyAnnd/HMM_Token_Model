the year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four pictures tackling real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. of the four pictures to make it to the race to the oscars in early 2005 (kinsey, the aviator, hotel rwanda, and, ray), ray became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to jamie foxx for his portrayal of r & b genius ray charles.<br /><br />and it was well-deserved despite that leonardo dicaprio came close and liam neeson wasn't even nominated. what made foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, ray charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that charles' had penned. it did help that jamie foxx rose well above the movie -- itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a tv biopic -- and his portrayal is detailed as it's ferocious. he has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances, and once the crisis of ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.<br /><br />the low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing ray's relationship with women. like the aviator, taylor hackford wishes to establish that ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is sharen warren as ray's mother. hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young ray but her facial and body language is gut-wrenching, especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have ray find his way around the house. such intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. a beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.<br /><br />a fantastic counterpoint to ray is the featured music. anyone who knows r & b will enjoy the early recordings of ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and jamie foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as ray. that alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. i would have, though, loved it if they would have used his last adult contemporary hit from 1993, "sing my song for you" in the closing credits. after all, it is ray charles, a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art.
