when "madame" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. the snobbish butler edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. an adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat o'malley. he helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.<br /><br />the force of this movie is in its humor and music. edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings. one of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs lafayette and napoleon. the score is great and like in "the jungle book" you have scenes that is almost "musical" in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance. and of course we like, that the score is quite jazzy.<br /><br />and of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one.<br /><br />regards simon
