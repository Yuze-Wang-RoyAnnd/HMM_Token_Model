i'm a horror movie freak, and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks i've ever seen. the plotline is totally original (who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity?), the special effects are amazing, and the cinematography couldn't be better. some may find it disturbing, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. it also makes a good point. the spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous. the spiral notebook, spiral seashells, spirals on cakes. of all the shapes they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle) this was one of the best choices. if you can find this movie, definitely see it. it's certainly unique, and quite unforgettable.
