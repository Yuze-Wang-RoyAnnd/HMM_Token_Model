this is a truly wonderful love story. i liked the songs, however even if you do not, you have to love the story. peter o'toole is at his best and petula clark is doing fine as well. i first saw this when i was about 13 and loved it then. now in my forties, i still enjoy it, probably even more. still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. it is a movie to watch only with a new age guy or by yourself as it is a chick flick. but whats wrong with that. need a little romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie.<br /><br />
