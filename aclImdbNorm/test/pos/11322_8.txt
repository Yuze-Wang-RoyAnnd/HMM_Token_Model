well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times. no happy endings, super-heroes, or miracles here. just down-to-earth fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism, and what-ifs. kudos to percival and mickery for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by percival. films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there. if every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities i believe terrorism could not thrive. this movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. even though the film is a bit propagandist against islam (the use of a muslim police officer as a main character) i believe it was entirely realistic. there was meant to be shock-value in the bombing incident. as a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this, they showed full nudity of women being decontaminated post-attack. it didn't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought, i.e., we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. although this took place in london, with the usual high-level british acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. great movies don't have to be blockbuster epic productions, and this movie is very very worthy of viewing.
