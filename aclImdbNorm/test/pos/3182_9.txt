this was such a great series for black folks at the time. we loved it so much. it was the only show about black middle class families on t.v. at the time. please release this on dvd. i know many...many people who still talk about the show. if it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. the show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more. the show ended in such an abrupt way and left it's fans speechless and wondering why it was taken off the air. since then we have only seen a few of the actors and actresses. please release it on dvd asap.
