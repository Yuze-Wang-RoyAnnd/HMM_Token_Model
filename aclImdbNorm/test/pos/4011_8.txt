i used to watch this show when i was growing up. when i think about it, i remember it pretty well. if you ask me, it was a pretty good show. anytime i think about it, i don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. also, the writing was very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i'm not sure if i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
