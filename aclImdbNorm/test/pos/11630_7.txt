ok. is barney the best children's show of all time? of course not. but in some of the comments left by other members of imdb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. well guess what? it's barney for god's sake. he shows children good behavior, good manors and that it's ok to be who you are. for those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you. to the imdb member who wrote the review on the first page i think you may have gone a little too far. did you actually describe a sesame street character as "down to earth"? grow up everyone, this is a great show for preschoolers and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way.
