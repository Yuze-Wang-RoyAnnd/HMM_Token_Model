i once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on turner classic movies about 6 months back. i thought every minute of what i was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the film's middle and i didn't want to spoil the whole thing if i were to watch it from the start, i decided that i would rent it immediately. well, the video store which i frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. i had previous to that experience only seen some chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after i saw the snippet of the great dictator, i checked out three of his other films, city lights, the gold rush, and modern times (city lights was great, i found the gold rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and i found modern times to be one of the funniest films i've ever seen (second funniest, behind keaton's sherlock jr., more exactly).<br /><br />finally, the whole of the great dictator. well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. but these moments don't always mix well. chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (city lights is the best example of this), but it didn't always work with social commentary. plus, the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of chaplin's talent. don't get me wrong, i liked the movie as a whole, but i thought it of little consequence. i would have given it a solid 7/10 on the ratings scale...if not for the ending. the final speech that the jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. yes, it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. the speech brought me to tears, and i consider it one of the best endings i've ever seen. final score: 8/10.
