despite what its critics ensue, i enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is. eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before, won oscars, is at the top of his game. ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, steve's day at the midway if you will. i am generally not a fan of zeta-jones but even i must admit that kate is stunning in this movie. it's ending screams of an upcoming trequel and i will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of george and brad and matt parlay through clooney's digs in lago di como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again. if we tolerated 3 installments of the lord of the rings, i ask if we can drool over clooney's salt and pepper lid just one more time?
