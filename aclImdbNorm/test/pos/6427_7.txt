footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. "psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description i can think of. the female protagonist, alice cespi, discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days. the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. she is also haunted by a recurring, very vivid, dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago. in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone, but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before. this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold, and particularly, how it will end. the unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well. the important part of the one and only nicoletta elmi, everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror, is an extra bonus.
