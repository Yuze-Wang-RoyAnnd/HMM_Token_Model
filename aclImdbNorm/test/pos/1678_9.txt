rififi (jules dassin - france 1955)<br /><br />to me, it seems a very risky idea to attempt a hollywood-remake of jules dassin's 1955 classic rififi. planned for release in 2007, al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead, taking on the role of tony le stephanois. risky business... how they're gonna pull this off?<br /><br />ironically, dassin was blacklisted in hollywood and went on to try his luck in france and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some "the grandddady of all caper- and heist movies". in my opinion, it remains a one-of-a-kind classic, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film. whatever one's opinion of the film.<br /><br />in the last couple of years rififi has become dangerously overpraised. nevertheless, this french noir-classic shouldn't be forgotten. go see it, before the remake is out there, in order to have some ammunition for comparing the two.<br /><br />camera obscura --- 9/10
