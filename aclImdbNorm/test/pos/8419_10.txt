shwaas is awesome ! considering that the producers had a meagre budget, they have done an excellent job. it is a must watch. the small kid has done an excellent job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes. grandfather is at his best. the photography is superb. technically correct and very creative. it helps in adding a lot of emotions to the mainstream content. the movie will keep u engrossed and don't be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story lingers in your mind for a few days.i sincerely hope that they make it to the final oscar nomination<br /><br />enjoy and again don't miss it
