this is the last film of a trilogy by the brilliant turkish director, nuri bilge ceylan, whose last film mayis sikintisi -which was very cehovian- was shown in prestigious film festivals. differing from his previous films, the story of 'uzak' is set on istanbul which is one of the most crowded cities of the world. however, in ceylan's film, we do see only minor traces of that huge crowd. rather he choose to focus on two characters, one photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships. the photographer, who -we understand that- has also immigrated to the city, seems to be inhabited the customs of the city life, not only in material sense. in his relation to his relative, we see him first as caring and tolerant, however, when he could not find a job, our suburbian character starts to be disturbed for sharing his private 'space' with someone whose leaving date becomes ambiguous. i will not reveal the tactics he develops in order to pull his relative out of his life to prevent any harm on your viewing pleasure, but it is enough to say that ceylan shows us the tactics that we acquire within the routine of suburbian life; 'tactics' to keep our own private space, 'tactics' in order not to communicate with other people, 'tactics' to prevent our relationships from gaining a complex nature (since our own experience, we believe that, is complex enough).<br /><br />ceylan's film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the borders of modern (or postmodern ?) city by depicting the two characters in different manners. but, he doesn't condemn any of the two characters for doing this, rather he uses the power of cinematic language to underline this difference. for example, in search of new opportunities, we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces. even within the house, he prefers balcony as his favourite space. on the other hand, we see the photographer always within the closed spaces, and generally at his home. although there are more than 10 million people out there, and lots of adventures, lots of interesting things to discover (or are there any?) he prefers sitting at home, watching tv, etc. his home is like his temple, a kind of sacred place.<br /><br />everyone living in a big city, and conscious of the experience he is living through, will find something belonging to himself in uzak. if you like this film, i am sure that you will like ceylan's other two films, mayis sikintisi (the clouds of may) and kasaba (the town). go and find them!.
