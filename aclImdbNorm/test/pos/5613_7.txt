i thoroughly enjoyed this movie...and i watch it from time to time still. i've used it in my music classes at the school where i teach. the kids seem to enjoy it, although, they wish it were in color.<br /><br />the best thing about this movie is, for me, who grew up after heifetz had died, is the chance to actually see the master violinist work his craft! i was surprised at how "up to date" the story line is. although, references to "reform school" are outdated. a boy, whose father had died, and is being raised by his mom and stepfather....most of our kids today are being raised by stepparents, although the movie makes it seem like most stepparents are cruel. i get very angry when his mother doesn't take his side and defend his actions against the step-father.<br /><br />also, the musical selections are difficult to believe. i find it unbelievable that a child, who looks to be about 8, can play the "minute waltz", or that a 13 year old girl could sing an aria from rigoletto.<br /><br />other than that, it's a really fun, feel good movie and i do recommend it. i wish it would come out on dvd.
