i saw this film at the 3rd adelaide international film festival at the palace cinemas, and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes. thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in australian films that seem to revolve around a)race b)gender and c) class, in favour of er...dare i say....jolly good cinema. the producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called alex frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood. apparently he's spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film, mostly in europe. the world the film creates is both brilliant and arty, not least because of strange and disconcerting editing style, the gothic characters, and the surreal sense of time and place that draws viewers into its nightmarish realm.<br /><br />the producer returned for the q + a after-wards. someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied "south australia." hear hear! another asked him what a 'day in the life of alex' entailed. he replied that he drives an old ute, that he has breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant that he's jolly well eaten at for the past 8 years! and that he plays piano which helps him to think. he doesn't drink booze and plays cricket once a week. then the q and a session ended abruptly because of the next film screening - so my thoughts are that for the next festival, they need to extend the after film sessions.
