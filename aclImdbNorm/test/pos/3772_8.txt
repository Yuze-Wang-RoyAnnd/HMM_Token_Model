so it's not an award winner, so what? have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? "the villain" and this one could top the list.my husband says that "jekyll and hyde together again" is one of those movies that if "you've been there and done that" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. i think the whole film is just fun. nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, howard hughes.... there are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate. to say that the film doesn't follow the book would be true, but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also. i recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. we may be smarter now, but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew (ourselves?) back in the old days.
