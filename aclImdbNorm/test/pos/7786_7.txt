rks after the success of ghayal started work on this film which was a comedy the film was in making for 3 years and released finally in 1994 but didn't work for some reason before this film, damini(93) released and did well <br /><br />the film is a mad comic film like most priyadarshan films nowdays but it is funny and well handled the film has a proper plot unlike today's films and makes you laugh most characters became famous, be it crime master gogo(shakti kapoor), paresh rawal and others<br /><br />the film keeps you laughing throughout it's run time though being too slapstick and overdone yet it's one of the funniest films<br /><br />direction by rks is very good music is good<br /><br />amongst actors aamir steals the show and delivers his funniest performance, this was his first out n out comedy salman does well but looks amateur front of aamir, yet does a good job and their chemistry is delightful karisma is annoying and sounds like a child raveena is adequate paresh rawal is too funny in both roles, shakti kapoor is hilarious in his over the top act shehzad khan(dubbed by ajit) is very good and viju khote too is funny rest all are good too
