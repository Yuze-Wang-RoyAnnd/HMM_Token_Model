canthony is correct that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young judy garland (fourteen years old!) singing with a slightly older (by one year) deanna durbin. but i must disagree with everything else he or she said, including the running time -- which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (a single-reeler).<br /><br />the song is not her best, obviously; but it's enjoyable and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch on turner. the duet with durbin is quite interesting: two conflicting styles that nevertheless dovetail reasonably well.<br /><br />the short is just a throwaway, but it's nowhere near as bad as the other reviewer made it out to be. honestly, i enjoyed it.<br /><br />dafydd ab hugh
