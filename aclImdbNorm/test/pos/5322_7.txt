one wonders about the state of a society that produce a father like albert t. fitzgerald, who we first meet on a plane, as he is heading toward the place he abandoned a long time ago, and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy. when we first see him, he has caught a headline in the paper the woman in front of him is reading. rather rudely, he asks her if he could have the newspaper, and the lady offers other sections. well, that's not what he asked, what he wants the woman to do, is to give him the front section she is reading.<br /><br />matthew ryan hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects, in many ways, our society as it is today. in fact, mr. hoge is pointing out exactly at what is wrong with it.<br /><br />the film presents leland, a teen ager who can't even differentiate between fantasy and reality. it's evident that killing a human being, even the sweet and innocent boy who hasn't done anything to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for himself, but for his own family, and the family of the slain boy. in fact, leland seems to have no idea about what motivated him to commit the crime for he does not show any repentance about it.<br /><br />it's obvious leland has been traumatized by his parents divorce. his own father is an aloof man who couldn't care less about him. it's pearl, the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately, he doesn't have a chance.<br /><br />the best thing in the film is don cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. the ensemble cast does good work under mr. hoge's direction. kevin spacey has a good opportunity playing the egotistical father of the accused murderer and makes us detest him for being an arrogant idiot.<br /><br />although a bit long, the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered.
