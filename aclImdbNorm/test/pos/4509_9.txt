i have never read the book, but had always heard good things about it. so when the movie came out i considered going to see it, but never did. now it has come out on dvd and i have thought of renting for a few weeks now. last night i finally picked it up. i am very glad that i did.<br /><br />cinematography was incredible in this movie. the scenery, etc,... all made you feel like you were in kabul. the acting was all very good, although i am sure some of the emotions were lost in the translation. and the story itself was good and pure and uplifting. yes the story was very sad, but at the same time uplifting.<br /><br />and i will be honest, as a white american,... made me see aside of kabul and afghanistan that i never picture in my mind when i think about it. showed me a afghanistan before the taliban. showed me a place that was beautiful. showed me a place with good hearted people. i community that was like a family, aside from a few bullies.<br /><br />anyways, i recommend this movie to everyone. it is one of the best i have ever seen.
