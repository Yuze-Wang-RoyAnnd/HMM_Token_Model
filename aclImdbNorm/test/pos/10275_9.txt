gilles mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of max (vincent cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (monica bellucci) just before to get engaged to another woman. mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's haircut. oherwise it can get very confusing... still a strong film debut for mamouni, beautifully photographed by thierry arbogast (the 5th element, the messenger), and monica bellucci is a darling to watch ... i felt a little disappointed near the end so i gave it 9 out of 10.
