okay, so i love silly movies. if you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of mr. bruce campbell, i would go see this movie. this movie is all that i wanted it to be. being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. every time i thought to myself "this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen...." then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. it's a wonderful silly 'b'-movie. if you are a fan of campbell i'd say 'see it', bring your friends, laugh at it. it's fun. it's not classic, or anything, but if it's on tv some night, watch it. it has become, for me, a movie i would file under "indulgent movies". movies that may not be good, but after a hard day of work, i could come home and watch, (this list also includes 'harold and kumar go to white castle', 'army of darkness', and ' intolerable cruelty' ) <br /><br />if you feel like a over the top, wonderfully slightly bad movie, watch this. if not, go rent "bubba ho-tep"
