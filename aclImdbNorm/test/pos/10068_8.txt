"what's his name?" "loudon." "loudon what?" "clear."<br /><br />that gag still gets me, twenty one years after the film was released.<br /><br />i loved the film back then and i love it today. i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day, and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue.<br /><br />madonna plays nikki finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit. when she gets out she decides to seek revenge.<br /><br />griffin dunne (whatever happened to him?), plays an attorney for his fianc'ee's father (john mcmartin). the future father-in-law asks loudon to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations programme. a seemingly easy task, but there are complications aplenty, some funny dialogue, and some admittedly stupid-but-funny scenes along the way.<br /><br />madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me (hence only 8/10), but on the other hand i can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice.<br /><br />this film shows madonna's comic side (too lacking these days, perhaps), and she genuinely is funny in the role. dunne makes a great foil, while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fianc'ee.<br /><br />yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more.
