an untidy man, known as bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of marilyn monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for company. only the man can't think of anything to write. he wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. he begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. he follows him for a few days. while in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of bill, and inquires why bill is following him. the well dressed man says his name is cobb. cobb then surprisingly informs bill that he is a burglar, and even starts to take bill with him into houses to steal things; although cobb insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal. he says he likes to let people know he has been there, and interrupted the things they take for granted. he puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers, for example.<br /><br />the film is told in flashbacks at times too. the director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature memento. bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit, on the advice of cobb. he meets a blonde lady in a club, who used to date the owner, a bald man, who is very dangerous, she says. we see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the blonde lady's flat. these are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion.
