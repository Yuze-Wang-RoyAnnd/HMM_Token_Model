"who will love my children" saddest movie i have ever seen. definite 10/10. released on tv in 1983. movie has been released on vhs. dvd release is a must, sooner rather than later. mother dying of cancer, must find homes for all her children before she dies, because her thoughts are that her husband and father of the kids is not capable of caring for them once she has died. she manages to find homes for the children except one, a young boy whom is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy. very sad when your not wanted. in for a real good tear jerker, get your hands on this movie. i'm a male even i cried when i watched this movie. not to be missed.
