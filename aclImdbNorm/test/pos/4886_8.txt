having only seen five episodes of the show before this, (i've been watching the repeats on bbc two) i haven't really had much experience of the league, but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of british comedy, i can say this film is hilarious. seeing herr lipp, (who i had not seen on screen before the film) briss and geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. being on screen is something that the league take full advantage of, with heads blowing up, (it'll come as a surprise who it is) and gruesome murders with random middle ages style battles all the way.<br /><br />geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film, because he has the best one liners and overall behaviour, just like in the series. one of my only disappointments with the film was not hearing geoff shout "well now i've got this gun" even once, (even though there is a build-up to it in one part of the film.) the film itself overall is, to use the phrase everyone else does, pythonesque and it's very reminiscent of films like "life of brian." appearances from tubbs and edward were welcome, but papa lazarou's line "hello daves" cracked me up more than anything said by them, (lazarou's probably my favourite vasey character after tubbs and edward.) it's got quite a poignant ending with one of the main character being killed off and i can only hope this is not the league's last on-screen vasey venture. with gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or film, i'm now very excited. this is a film i will see again, partly because the projector died towards the end, leaving out 10 minutes or so of the film, but mainly because it's inventive and hilarious. i'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the tv series, because i loved it.<br /><br />one thing though, if you've never seen the league, you'll still love it, but dave knows what you'll think about the people who make this stuff up. as tubbs or edward might put it, it's a local film, for local people, and a precious thing at that.<br /><br />**** out of ***** (4/5)
