bbc's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by sarah waters..."fingersmith". life is tough without money, especially in dickensian london. dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas.is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? elaine cassidy as "maud lilly" and sally hawkins as "sue trinder" both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question ... of each other ...whilst rupert evans shines as the delightfully bad "gentleman".. with great support from imelda staunton's "mrs sucksby", david troughton's "mr ibbs" and charles dance's "uncle". the plot twists and turns and i wasn't sure i could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way... but somehow.. i do care... and thats because of the quality of the performances... love feels like love .. hate feels like hate... betrayal .. confusion.. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the dvd and enjoy.( elaine cassidy is just great in this.. gorgeous in fact.... i have to declare i am in her fan club... hi elaine : )
