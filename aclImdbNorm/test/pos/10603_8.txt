i didn't know what to expect from this. i always considered bam margera and the cky crew a team of knuckle heads devoted to to doing stupid things for entertainment. i didn't know that they could act. but everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances. the hilarity of the 'aaaaagh!' scene mixes in with ryan dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. at times the movie some scenes seem pointless but at the same time they're funny. i recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this film may not appeal to those that prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns.
