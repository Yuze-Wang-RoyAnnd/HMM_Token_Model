i felt compelled to comment on this film because it's listed as the fourth lowest-rated sci-film of all time on the imdb. what!?!? sure, this movie is crappy, but it's hilarious! it's not awful on an ed wood level, it's more surreal and uneven.<br /><br />there are some classic moments in the film. the brain surgery is gross and great- and even nuttier when you consider that the film was rated pg! gor chasing after his dolly before getting battery acid dumped on his face- "mine! gimmee!" zandor vorkoff's speeches at the beginning of the film- "before amir, kali was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" angelo rossito also has some great lines- "no, gor! no!" "you want these keys, don't you, my pretties?" it is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th lowest-rated sci-film on the imdb because it is entertaining. no matter how bad a film is, if it still manages to be weird, quirky, unsettling, or entertaining, it has merit and doesn't deserve to be dumped on and dismissed. i won't defend most of al adamson's films, but this one, along with dracula vs. frankenstein and blood of ghastly horror, are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness.
