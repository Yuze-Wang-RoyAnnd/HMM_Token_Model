this movie was advertised as a comedy but was far more serious than the trailers made it out to be. don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the movie, but was expecting more laughs. great performances from robin williams and laura linney. worth seeing, but don't go expecting to be rolling on the floor. the movie left me wondering what it would be like if robin williams character was a real person that was running for president. would we elect a comedian? i doubt it, unfortunately. that kind of stark honesty is something greatly lacking today. this is a movie that i will be adding to my dvd library as soon as it comes out on dvd. the movie has heart.
