a team of tough rogue new york cops led by the rugged, hard-nosed buddy manucci (superbly played by the always excellent roy scheider) go after a group of nasty mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of their number gets killed by them. director philip d'antoni, the producer of "bullet" and "the french connection," ably creates a potent, gritty, starkly amoral no-nonsense tone, maintains a steady pace throughout and stages the action scenes with considerable rip-roaring vigor. don ellis' rousing string score further pumps up the raw'n'rattling intensity while the scrappy big apple locations and urs furrer's rough, grainy cinematography both greatly enhance the overall grungy realism. moreover, the fine line distinguishing cops from criminals gets chillingly blurred in this picture: the titular squad use harsh, brutish and morally dubious strong-arm tactics as a means to an end for enforcing the law and there's certainly no code of honor amongst the thugs and thieves who populate the seedy urban underbelly that's vividly depicted in this movie. nice supporting performances by tony lo bianco as wormy, sniveling snitch vito lucia the undertaker, richard lynch as vicious psychotic hoodlum moon, bill hickman as moon's equally coldblooded partner bo, jerry leon as funky flatfoot mingo, and joe spinell as a parking garage attendant. an extremely wild and exciting protracted heart-in-your-throat mondo destructo car chase qualifies as a definite highlight. the climactic shootout likewise delivers the stirring goods. a real bang-up little winner.
