got back from morocco then, where my dad was attached to the german embassy, when the film came out in europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, show them the beauty of the country, where jimi had played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after leaving ibiza and before joining goa. sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in marrakech recently, the djema el fna was much wilder in those days than it is now; the stones went there earlier, brian recorded in tangiers ; so it's memories and family entertainment and i'm glad my son will get to know about the north of africa watching this movie. candice bergen looks beautiful and oo7/connery is pretty funny indeed; and teddy roosevelt as played by brian keith quite impressive.
