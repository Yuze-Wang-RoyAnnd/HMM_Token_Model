out of all the mafia movies i have ever seen this is one of the best for many reasons. the acting from pesci, cortese and vincent. the story is one of the best ever (in the mafia genre), as it realistic. the characters are people that lots of other people can relate to. this movie is also great as it's dialogue is good. it also has very realistic fights and action scenes. this movie also launched the careers of pesci and vincent. if it weren't for the success of this film, casino and goodfellas might not have been as good as they were. <br /><br />story 10/10 acting 9/10 realism 10/10<br /><br />overall 10/10<br /><br />my fave mafia movies are<br /><br />1: goodfellas 2: casino 3: the godfather trilogy 4: family enforcer (the death collector) 5: the sopranos (i know it isn't a movie)
