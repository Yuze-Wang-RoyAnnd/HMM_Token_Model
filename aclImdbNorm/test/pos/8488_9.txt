a couple of days ago i saw the awesome "house of sand and fog" and i was impressed with the amazing performance of ben kingsley in the lead role. i decided to see "ray", trying to understand how and why ben kingsley did not win the oscar of best lead actor. after watching jamie foxx in the role of ray charles, i agree with the academy: he really deserved to be awarded. i like ray charles, i was not his fan, but it is amazing the resemblance of jamie foxx with him. the film is completely supported by jamie foxx, who participates of most of the shootings, and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of ray charles. with regard to the story, i saw the extended version on dvd, too long but also very pleasant, with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie ray charles. my greatest surprise was to find that ray charles was heroine addicted, and how he treated his own family. the presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. my vote is nine.<br /><br />title (brazil): "ray"
