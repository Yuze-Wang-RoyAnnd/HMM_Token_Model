this is a good family movie with a few laughs. i wish it didn't have too much of the school stuff like the bully in it to fill the movie up. also, it seems a little too easy to save a piece of land from being built. i mean, the it just flowed too easily. it does make you aware of the wildlife. it had a cute way of introducing the piece of land which the fast runner but a little too slow for me. a little too hokey for me and it reminded me of going back to school. oh, the dvd is chock full of goodies so don't miss out. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out 10 for the dvd with the extras that is well worth to watch. well worth your time to see this!
