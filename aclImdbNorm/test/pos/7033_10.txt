there was talk on the e! hollywood special about the making of dirty dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies. maybe the music, the dancing, or the melodrama around the plot of baby frances becoming a dancing sensation with johnny castle. of course, this film established jennifer grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in ferris beuller's day off. patrick swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally. dirty dancing has it all to become a broadway or west end smash hit. it has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing. jennifer and patrick could revive their roles easily. it is nice to see jerry orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and kelly bishop as the mother. it all took place in the catskills in the sixties where many jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations. at the end of the film, it is sad to see the hotel owner, kellerman, be baffled by the next generation. it happened anyway! most people prefer cruises and traveling through europe than spending the summer in the catskills. those old grand hotels are becoming indian gaming casinos. let broadway bring dirty dancing alive and well. after all, they could do it for footloose and saturday night fever, this should be a no brainer! i know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times. there are people that have probably seen this film-a 1,000 times by now. somehow watching the making and the story behind dirty dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. dirty dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. i watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of baby's first days and her first true love with patrick swayze as heart throb, johnny castle. nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music, two soundtracks, and even a tour in the late eighties. i hope they bring it to broadway in a musical. it would work for the audience to be part of a film. no wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again. well, australia and london both have had productions of dirty dancing. it looks like it will come to broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.
