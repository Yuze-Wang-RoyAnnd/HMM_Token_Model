i had never heard of this film when a good friend recommended it. i trust this friend's taste, so i purchased the dvd. my wife and i sat down to watch it with no knowledge of what it was about. i thought it was the funniest film i have seen in a long time, mainly because i saw the truth in the satire. i strongly recommend this film to all my friends.<br /><br />this is not a film for everyone. some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity, and find idiocracy to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen. what these people don't seem to understand is that the crass humor is there, not to amuse the audience, but to show what appeals to the morons in the future.<br /><br />luke wilson is well cast as an "average joe." he is mainly there to be a foible for the biting commentary about society that is spread throughout this film. many of the funnier bits are in the background, so it is easily worth seeing several times. what makes the movie even funnier, and more scary, is that i see elements of it in every day life, in people i meet or on the media. then, i go back and re-watch idiocracy, and realize how good it is.<br /><br />the few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club. i'll see an advertisement for some product with some breakthrough new ingredient, and turn to my wife and say, "it's got electrolytes!" she knows exactly what i am saying.
