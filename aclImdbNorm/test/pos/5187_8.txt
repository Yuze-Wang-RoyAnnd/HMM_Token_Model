i recently purchased this on dvd as i hadn't heard of it and like robert carlyle.<br /><br />obviously this movie is not going to have hollywood blockbuster special effects,in saying that though the special effects were decent enough,and the acting was fine also.<br /><br />i found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at all,at almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of movie.<br /><br />do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end though,it is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline!
