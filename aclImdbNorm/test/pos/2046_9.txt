i think shane black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever! he gave us the awesome (at it's time)lethal weapon, shooting mel gibson to super stardom. then followed that up with the second best movie bruce willis has ever been in (the last boyscout).stumbled a bit with the last action hero, but redeemed himself with this one, the long kiss goodnight.<br /><br />if you're a fan of action films, this has it all...action, comedy, thrills, then tops it of with more action, comedy and thrills. geena davies is great, samual l jackson is even greater. don't miss it !<br /><br />9/10
