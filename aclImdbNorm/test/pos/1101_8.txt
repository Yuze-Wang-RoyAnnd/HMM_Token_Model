ok....so, by minute 15 in the film, there's still no dialogue.<br /><br />this film arrived to me in a padded sack from down under, with sharpie encrypted info on the front. i am a programmer from a north american fest, and mod love was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem'd at the far-away moscow/karlovy vary interface.<br /><br />straight away i thought "this film is not for us" (no dialogue by minute 15??) but kept watching anyway. well, well, well. it built and built and built, and half way in i was involved in this film, because, like when you go to the zoo, at first you're reticent, but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit, you're totally 'there'.<br /><br />this film has a dangerousness, not at all like the much hyped wolf creek, but because it is so totally 'other' in every way shape and form, and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first-time helmers ie. - gloomy weather, red-neck intrigue, odd splicing, eerie music, and a plot which, though imperfect and basic, has a bit in common with one of the 'great aussie movies' ie the cars that ate paris, by wier. but modern love is actually not really a very aussie movie in the sense of ocker-ishness and playful self-deprecation that pervades many of that country's films. it works on a more nightmarish realm from the start. no cell-phones, no brand names, no i-pods, no gritty urban middle/class angst - just a dude married to a good-looker, an old volvo, and a little boy (son) who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around. oh and it's set in weird sea-side village where people all look slightly 'wrong.' photographed by nick matthews (2:37) and music by tom huzenroeder (ten canoes) mod luv succeeds where many aust. movies fail - ie it stands up without regard to the "god-forsaken" country that it comes out of. instead, it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve - and herein lies the weak link...what on earth does this film have to do with "modern love"???? the final minutes of the film seem to give an answer, or at least hints at one....and as i sat and drank a coffee and ate my hershey's afterwards, all that i could surmise was that this film's helmer, alex frayne, will prob have a lot of fun with this one./
