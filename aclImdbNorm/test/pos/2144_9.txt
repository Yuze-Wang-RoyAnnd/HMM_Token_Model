until today, i thought there only three people, including me, who considered heaven's gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, little big man (1970), jeremiah johnson (1972), the outlaw josey wales (1976) and the long riders (1980).<br /><br /> i was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at imdb rate this movie a 10, as do i. a recent book, the worst movies of all time, includes heaven's gate. through it's production and release it was vilified, as no movie since cleopatra, almost twenty years before. at one time it was considered the most expensive over-budget movie of all time, surpassing even cleopatra. it was blamed for the downfall of its studio, united artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling. michael cimino, fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess, but clearly, that was petty jealousy at its worst.<br /><br /> cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the american experience. this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking.
