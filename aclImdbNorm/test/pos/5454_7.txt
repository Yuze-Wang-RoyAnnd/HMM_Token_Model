i read the book written by bill carter on which this movie is based many years ago. the book is certainly stronger than the movie. it provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide, the end result being that i thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items. all things considered, though, and given the limitations of the medium, the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between jay leno and david letterman in the early 90's to host "the tonight show" after the retirement of johnny carson.<br /><br />the highlight is clearly the performances. i can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well-known and on tv on a regular basis. john michael higgins nailed the part of letterman perfectly. watching him really was like watching letterman. daniel roebuck tried valiantly to be jay leno, but somehow didn't pull it off as effectively. his whole "look" seemed fake, and he just didn't seem natural in the role. in a less central role, rich little not surprisingly nailed the voice of carson, although the look was a bit off. in the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably leno's agent, helen kushnick. in the movie, kathy bates was perfect in the role, although not quite as out of control as carter's portrayal of the woman in writing.<br /><br />in the end, this is light and entertaining viewing. the subject matter isn't especially important in the overall scheme of things, but it's a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry. 7/10
