so the koreans are now knocking off american horror flicks. but they are doing so with style. doll master is a close copy of puppetmaster and dolls, and even has a little child's play going for it. several young adults are invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls, only to find they are targets of a vengeful spirit. the dolls come to life and do some pretty nasty things to the kids. the gore level is reasonably high, the photography and set design and production values are first rate, the acting isn't all that bad, and the scares are definitely there. doll master may not be in the same league with a tale of two sisters or even dead friend, but it's close. give it a watch. you won't be disappointed.
