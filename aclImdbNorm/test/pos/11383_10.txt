sometimes the academy doesn't recognize the potential of some films, or doesn't nominate them because they are controversial or strong. sometimes they are nominated, but don't win anything (i hope this doesn't happen this year with "american beauty"). this is exactly what happened with "boogie nights", which was the best film of 1997. the academy preferred to give the best picture oscar to "titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, and other awards to the overrated "good will hunting" and the irritating "full monty". the other pictures which were nominated in the main category were "l.a. confidential" and "as good as it gets", great movies, but "boogie nights" is still better and should have been remembered in more categories.<br /><br />this amazing film tells the story of eddie adams (mark wahlberg, in a surprisingly great performance), a 17 year old barman who takes the attention of jack horner (burt reynolds, in a redeeming acting), a director of porn films. eddie has a special 'gift', and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies. he changes his name for dirk diggler and starts to make a huge success. but fame... doesn't last forever. other characters also have their parallel stories- amber waves (julianne moore, perfect), buck (don cheadle) and others, including rollergirl (heather graham), an actress who accepts to do anything, but she has to be wearing her roller shoes.<br /><br />what could have been a banal, trivial film, turns into a perfect, memorable one in the hands of paul thomas anderson. what makes "boogie nights" such a great film is its execution, added to a clever, well written screenplay, great soundtrack, etc. each character is very well developed, and each of them has his/her importance in the context. each feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of the modern american cinema.<br /><br />"boogie nights" is a strong, impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema. under a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of highs and downs, things that we face in our lives. it is an amazing portrait of the end of the '70s and the beginning of the '80s, exactly an age of highs and downs. that's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. <br /><br />10/10
