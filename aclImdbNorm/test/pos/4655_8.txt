a rather silly little film you just may love.<br /><br />although rather corny and clich'e at times, it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun. five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy "knowing yours is the best team."<br /><br />notable for several screen debuts including david naughton's first film role after his dr. pepper "be a pepper" commercials and before his major 1981 hit "american werewolf in london". also features paul ruebens in what i believe is his first pee wee herman-esquire roll a year before he became known for it. and last but not least, mr. spin city and alex keaton himself, michael j. fox gets his first film role here. fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house. outside of that, no names, but all funny characters.<br /><br />doubt it has ever made it to dvd, but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late, late show sometime. if you do, is worth your watch. you may hate it, but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love.
