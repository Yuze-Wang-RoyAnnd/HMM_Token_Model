brilliant thriller, deserving far more fame, mitchum and ryan are awesome in their starring roles, as is the entire supporting cast. a truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue, at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. based on a novel concerning homophobia, this movie attacks post-war anti-emitism, and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences, it still has the power to shock, and works very well as a thriller in its own right. a credit to all involved.
