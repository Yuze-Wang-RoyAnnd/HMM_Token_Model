one of the most macabre, depressing, yet eye-opening docs. i've watched in awhile. there's no narration or story that's told, just a "third eye" type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in nyc through the seasons. watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then "clean" their needles in the public toilets... sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather.<br /><br />anyone currently in recovery of alcohol/drug addition should watch this when they're craving - it really shows you to what you could be going back to! after seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with.<br /><br />the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today. judging from what is shown in the doc., there's no hope for any of them. they mention wanting to get better and quit, but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying.<br /><br />this definitely isn't for all audiences. i found myself kind of like watching a car accident - after i started watching it i just couldn't turn it off. i had to keep watching with a dark/morbid fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these addicts.
