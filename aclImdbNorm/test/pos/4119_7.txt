george saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of hamlet, killing a guard in the process. months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money. one of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the nazi's. not happy at being taken the nazi front man insists on getting his money back, at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up. the middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the new york public library between various parties, however as people begin to die, the library is locked down and more murders (and perhaps some rare book larceny) seem to be close to happening. complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast (saunders is joined by richard denning and a cast of solid supporting players) if there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves. the layers of theft, forgery, murder and war time intrigue (this was 1942) are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time. still its an enjoyable little film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs. until denning shows up we're down among some charming thieves, whom we like, perhaps even more than the hero, but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending, and they know it, even if they fight it. a good little film that's worth searching out.
