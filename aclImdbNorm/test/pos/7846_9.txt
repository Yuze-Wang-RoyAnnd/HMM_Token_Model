the beguiled is a pretty satisfying film for those who are after the things above. for clint eastwood's die-hard fans, it will be a disappointment. although eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role (except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer, which he isn't so unacquainted with), the ambiguous nature of his character, which goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and insatiable woman eater (to put it that way) will eventually be too much to handle for anyone used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition, morally a bit unclean but still without that dark side. i think he manages to pull this unlikely part off, but those who really steal the show are the two rivalising women, the schoolmistress geraldine page and the head of the students, played by elizabeth hartman.<br /><br />we see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. hartman's edwina is the sweetest, most innocent girl in the world until she becomes infatuated with john mcburney and becomes possessive of him. this is what causes tragedy, as well as the headmistress' secret lust, the forbidden fruit. she carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother, whom she clearly idolizes still. the fourth factor in this "unholy" love spiral is the wicked carol, played by jo ann harris, who lures john away from his crush on edwina and into her bed.<br /><br />the whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of gothic feel, which makes it a pretty rare thing in the western genre, but a popular thing in the movies of the 70's. a unique achievement by the siegel/eastwood team and a movie not for the faint hearted.
