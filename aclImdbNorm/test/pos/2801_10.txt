this film is about xavier, an erasmus exchange student from paris who spends one year in barcelona. during that time, under the influence of all the new impressions, he changes and grows. upon return, he has a much clearer view on his life and finally takes it into his own hands.<br /><br />this is one of the most moving films i've ever seen, and the reason is probably that i've been in a very similar situation. i'm from germany, not from france, and for me it was madrid, not barcelona, but i can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an erasmus semester in spain will do to you. from what i hear the story is autobiographic, and that's probably why it is so realistic.<br /><br />let me give some examples (mild spoiler alert) - xavier shares a flat with other students from italy, denmark, germany, belgium, spain, and england. the flat looks exactly like all the erasmus shared flats i've seen in madrid. the main characters are nicely developed, and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. the spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. - the story of xavier and his girlfriend martine, who remained in paris, is also very typical. about 90% of all relationships break up during an erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). - there's a wonderful scene in which xavier tries to convince wendy, his flatmate from england who is kind of "uncool", to go out with all the others. he finally succeeds, and wendy probably has the night of her life.<br /><br />another great thing in this film is that it's truly trilingual: the students in the flat speak spanish or english, and xavier speaks french with his mother and girlfriend. there are subtitles so that everyone can understand what's being said. i surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywhere.<br /><br />i can imagine that for non-erasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy, but for all my fellow erasmus i can only say: this is your film! if you haven't seen it, do so. but be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia...<br /><br />10/10
