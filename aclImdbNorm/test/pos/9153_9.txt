and nothing wrong in that! heartily endorse the comments of boblipton and snow leopard.<br /><br />i'm thrilled to find this movie is available on us dvd - i've only ever seen it through once - i persuaded the goethe institute here in london to show it in their conrad veidt season some years ago - and long to see it again.<br /><br />barrymore is resplendent when engaged, as in this movie, possibly because of the prick of having a renowned german actor as a foil. and veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer (doesn't he pick his nose at one point?) this is one of the seminal films to connect 'dr jekyll' with '20th century', 'grand hotel' or 'midnight'; and 'the cabinet of dr caligari' or 'the student of prague' with 'the spy in bladk', 'contraband' and 'casablanca'.<br /><br />see it!
