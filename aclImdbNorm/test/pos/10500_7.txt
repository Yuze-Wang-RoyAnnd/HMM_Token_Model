thank you the filmzone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a.m. i truly enjoyed it. to be honest, i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with mckayla, dru berrymore, and of course, the talented chloe nicholle (as rebecca carter).<br /><br />the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldn't harm. for example, the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie. there's absolutely no effort in lightning. but let's ignore that fact because let's be honest, we watched "pleasures of sin" because of the high amounts of sex.<br /><br />the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy, explicit scenes. chole nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast.<br /><br />so my advice is , watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs. nicholle.<br /><br />recommended only for the sex scenes; don't expect anything else.
