this would definitely not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good. so, on his recommendation, i bought a copy, since i didn't know if it would ever be on tv again. i had never heard of anybody in it except armand assante. at first i had a hard time getting into the story, because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images-- and it doesn't make much sense. it is only later in the movie that it all comes together. the scene-cutting- if that's what it's called, is a bit jarring-- it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene, and the scenes are jerky--but i guess that was done to add to the unusualness (if that's a word). the story veers here and there, and just about the time you have it all figured out, everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not. or bad woman. the acting is very good-- i kept thinking how much norman reedus looks like leo decaprio. the ending was a real twist, totally unexpected, which i liked. a good show.
