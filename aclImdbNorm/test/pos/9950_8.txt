this is a cherished movie from my childhood!! i can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat!! i remember getting to stay up late to watch this movie with my father, usually two to three times a year. we always referred to it as "giant robot". although the effects in this movie are crude compared to today's standards, they were perfect for this movie's genre. i am also a big fan of the japanese "monster" movies, so this movie fell right in to place with the others. it's been years since i've seen this movie & would love to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter.
