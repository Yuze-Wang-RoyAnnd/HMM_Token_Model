an opera diva has an accident, which leaves the door open for her understudy to take over the role. betty (marsillach) is now the star of mac beth, but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out. he gets his kicks out of tying betty up, putting needles under her eyes (so she cant close them) and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes.<br /><br />"opera" is certainly one of argento's more ambitious films, like mixing it up with shakesphere's macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is giuseppe verdi's version of macbeth but also argento, just like shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune. and like the ravens circling the castle dunsinane, foreboding the demise of the scheming macbeth, the ravens in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer. furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. but i don't want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or macbeth, the similarities are far too subtle. it's just a typical argento masterstroke, and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of gothic mystique.<br /><br />although this movie does have it downsides like the heavl metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange.<br /><br />all in all "opera" is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good.
