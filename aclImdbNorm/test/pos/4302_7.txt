this is a well directed columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a columbo movie. this also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. it's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. at least when compared to different columbo movies.<br /><br />for instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the columbo character himself. it makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times, also mostly since it doesn't correspond with most other columbo movies.<br /><br />the characters are good and it helps that it features martin landau in a double role. it's always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man, while for instance a person such as peter falk hardly changed any over the years, he only got grayer. the movie also features julie newmar among others, who is best know for playing catwoman in the '60's "batman" life action series. it's funny how she still moves like catwoman in this movie. intentional or is this just her way of acting?<br /><br />it's an enjoyable and good to watch columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script.<br /><br />7/10
