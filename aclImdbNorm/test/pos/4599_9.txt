shame on fox for dumping this movie. it was a total riot and i only hope that it will find a second life on dvd and cable.<br /><br />this is a hilarious satire. it takes the "what if" situation to an extreme and it doesn't pull any punches (or kicks to the groin). it makes you think... what is to become of this empire once we've gotten totally to lazy and stupid? everyone gets hit in this one esp. a number of major corporations, and even fox news takes a punch(which is probably why the movie never had a proper release - other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it "so we'll just give up!") some may find the movie sophomoric, due to the groin kicking, and farting, but the movie is much more than that. you either get what mike judge is saying, or you don't. most of the negative reviews i've read seem to come from people who just don't get it or are film snobs.<br /><br />it'll probably play for one week in the selected markets so if you miss it, keep an eye out for the dvd, it'll be worth the rental and i will eventually have it in my collection.<br /><br />good job mike judge, it's a shame that you got screwed, but you made me laugh out loud and i look forward to the next movie you do.
