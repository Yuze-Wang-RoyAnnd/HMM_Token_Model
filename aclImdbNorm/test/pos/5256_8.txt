the women is a cute movie about women at all ages (but mostly 30+) and their issues in life. not just men and infidelity, but also about relationships with friends & family, making time to connect with others, problems with image, compromising your values, accomplishments in life, and finding what will really make you happy.<br /><br />it's also about being true to yourself. a lot of times, people will give you advice but not really follow it themselves. sometimes they have created a delusion for themselves, and should you really follow in that same path or react based on your feelings now? i really liked this movie. granted, it was trying a bit to be like sex & the city at times, but that probably helped me like it. the difference here is it's kind of like the discoveries after the stage in life that the sex & the city stars were in -- here, most are married or past the point of trying to find a man. now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives.<br /><br />obviously it's not an oscar contender, but it is entertaining and serves its purpose.<br /><br />and for the men out there, there were an equal share of men and women in the movie theater (most were with their wives/girlfriends), and the men were in fact laughing. :)
