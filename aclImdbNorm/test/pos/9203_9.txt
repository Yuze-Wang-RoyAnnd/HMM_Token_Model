i was shocked to learn that jimmy caan has left this show, does anyone know why? i regard james as one of the all-time greats and wasn't surprised he ended up on tv, which can be better than the crap you see on the big screen. the stories are slick and the camera faster than a speeding bullet! mustn't forget the rest of the cast: james, vanessa(yum!)nikki, molly, josh, mitch.. also,can anyone tell me why on earth there's a crap theme tune on the dvd sets, but elvis's jxl remix of a little less conversation is used on the initial nbc broadcasts?? does it not make sense to use a tune that you would associate with the gambling mecca of america for dvd releases??
