so many literary adaptations are disappointments. there are many reasons for that, but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay. the dead is unusual - it had to be 'padded', as the short story itself is a tiny, relatively short gem. it may in fact be the finest short story in the english language. in beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of gabriel conroy that his life, and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead. even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him.<br /><br />to bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky. john huston did a magnificent job. he never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story. it is simple and true, with outstanding acting. the only slight miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy.<br /><br />its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece, but i think its fair to use this term for this movie. its not a bravura piece of film making, but it is simple and pure - i always think of ozu's movies when i think of the dead, its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.
