like for most women this movie is the ultimate chick-flick. with it's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, i mean timeless classic like (i've had) the time of my life & the wonderful she's like the wind makes this movie. i adore patrick swayze in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot. he sings "she's like the wind" in the movie. the chemistry between swayze and co-star jennifer grey is amazing. i love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. but saying this dirty dancing 2: - havana nights is also great but patrick swayze scenes makes this. i love the songs, dancing and everything about it but it isn't dirty dancing. like i said it's an amazing chick flick. please let there be a 3rd because i love to see what happens with patrick's character johnny. jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey patrick makes up for that if you know what i mean!!! great movie and i'm so pleased billy zane didn't win the movie role. i heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn't dance.
