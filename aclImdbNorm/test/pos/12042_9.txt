darr is an brilliant movie..it is 1 of my favourite films..srk has done a mind blowing job in the movie....<br /><br />this role couldn't have been played by anyone else because this type of role only suits srk...<br /><br />srk plays a mental villain in the film..<br /><br />srk's performance in this movie is the best performance ever in boll wood...<br /><br />srk deserves an honour and an encouraging appeal for his fantastic performance...<br /><br />juhi also delivers an excellent performance..<br /><br />sunny deol looked strong and physically fit in the film..
