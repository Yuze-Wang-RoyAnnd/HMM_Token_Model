some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. i loved this flick but i don't feel guilty about it. you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie. but jack frost 2 won't go over well with some people. right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it. well, if you get the privilege to watch this movie, after watching it remember that jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. now, because i can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes: <br /><br />**spoilers** <br /><br />the three women on the beach had great deaths. the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her. the next woman fell on a bed of icicles. the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs.<br /><br />the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole. one of them gets their tongue stuck on it (of course). jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying "cowa-tongue-a dude!". well, you have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />and of course, the snowball children kicked ass.<br /><br />**end spoilers**<br /><br />infinity stars
