death in venice is a movie i need to see once every ten years. it is always different, because i am always at a different stage of life.<br /><br />the movie is about art, beauty, longing, death. some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to watch, especially if you have seem them before. yet i would not want to miss a single frame. the music is repetitive, the main theme of the adagietto from mahler's fifth is used again and again. yet i would not want to miss a single note. when the last image fades, the last note dies, i am left numb and exhausted.<br /><br />this movie is a monument to film making. as with most really good movies, the saturday evening crowd should stay away from it. and this is simply the best movie ever.
