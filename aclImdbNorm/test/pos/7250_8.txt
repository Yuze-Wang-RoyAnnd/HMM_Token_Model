plunkett and macleane is an entertaining, fast-paced and refreshing film. refreshing because, unlike most other period films, it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or preach pompously - indeed, historical accuracy is all but ignored. this film does not take itself too seriously, and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten. plunkett and macleane is set in the 18th century, yet director jake scott offers a thoroughly 90s take. there's action, sex and swearing aplenty, and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy dance to disco beats. jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are brilliant as always, and the rest of the cast, especially alan cumming as a flirtatious fop, are also highly entertaining. the film is visually spectacular in places, and is a mixture of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by liv tyler with a shaky english accent. in short, if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours, this is the film for you. it won't make you think, but it could well put a smile on your face.
