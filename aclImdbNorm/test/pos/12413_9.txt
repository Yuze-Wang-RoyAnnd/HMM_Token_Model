i know that chill wills usually played lovable old sorts in westerns. but his role in this segment is something i've remembered for a long time. wills could be a first rate villain. yes, burgess meredith's fall was correct! that look in hepplewhite's eye! it expressed porcine greed, ignorance, and the threat of violence all at once. quite a performance, i think.<br /><br />the segment itself was a good one, too. question: couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism? i guess it did, sort of, with fall. but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure, if he had it, as quickly as possible to hepplewhite.<br /><br />there is one moment that was annoying but also necessary. and it is something that appears to recur in these night gallery segments. it's serling's constant need to sermonize. for that's what we got, one more time, with dr. fall. i don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop fall from preaching about the bag's benefit for humanity, all while rubbing hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud, and, therefore, all but begging for hepplewhite to strike out at him. but as i say, it was necessary. at least it was for me. otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to see wills' performance discussed above. all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word.
