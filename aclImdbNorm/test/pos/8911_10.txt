first off, the alien saves a little black boy as well as a mexican, despite what the imdb plot summary suggests. this film is the fulfillment of the purest of male fantsies, interracial rape. the main character in this film is a george michaelesque dope, who doesn't understand primal human urges like drug abuse and murder. in fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. what a square. in any case, my favorite scene is when he writes the gang members a letter stating if they want the 500 bucks they get from the reading center for protection they must meet with him. at the meeting he is surrounded by countless chicano gangsters, but he keeps a cool head. in slow motion, he punches the wooden post of a stop sign that shatters upon contact. then, still in slow motion, points at the leader of the gang and says, "noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" the gang members comply. cool, right? the beauty of this film shows through in these simple solutions to social problems like prostitution and gang violence.
