i must admit, at first i was worried about farscape. the opening segment was not very strong, and i began to worry about what was to come. however, once it set in to familiar henson territory with the wry sense of humor, the unique and enduring characters, and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction. the story follows john crichton (played by ben browder) a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on slingshot propulsion. however, during the first test, his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field, and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy, where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners (on the starship moya) and the peacekeepers (human enforcers). he is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship, and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners (ka d'argo, a luxom warrior; pa'u zhaan, a delvian priestess; rygel xvi, a deposed ruler; and aeryn sun, a peacekeeper who has reluctantly joined the crew). with excellent special effects, moderate make-up, and puppets and robots that exceed the henson standard of perfection; as well as a very well written story, and character driven plot, farscape looks to be a fantastically original, creative, and clever science fiction series.
