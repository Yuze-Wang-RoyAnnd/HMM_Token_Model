"the merchant of venice" was one of shakespeare's most popular plays during his own lifetime, but it has fallen on hard times during the 20th century because of its undeniably anti-semitic content. the play has also been called schizoid in its careening from comedic scenes to tragic ones, leading some to say it is two plays trying to coexist as one. bassanio (joseph fiennes, who played william shakespeare in "shakespeare in love") is in love with portia (lynn collins, superb), but needs to borrow a considerable sum of money to woo her. he goes to his sometime gay lover antonio (jeremy irons), who hasn't the funds on his person, but takes out a loan from the jewish usurer shylock (al pacino). shylock is amused and offended that antonio, who insults him for his religion, now comes to him for money, but he offers it, on the condition that the penalty for defaulting on the loan will be a pound of antonio's flesh. which is, of course, what happens. bassanio and portia offer shylock considerably more then the original loan instead of the pound of flesh, but shylock, distraught after his daughter leaves him and marries a christian, refuses to take it. portia, in a scene where the audience is never quite sure where to place its sympathies, deprives shylock of what should be legally his, and then strips him of his wealth and religion. shylock was originally essayed as a cartoonish villain, but modern actors and directors have turned him into a tragic figure, railing against the injustices of 16th century venice. al pacino does an excellent job as shylock, and jeremy irons is good as antonio, but i think that lynn collins' work as portia is the best part of the play. portia is one of the few notable female roles in shakespeare's canon, and collins is wonderful in the part. joseph fiennes is more than a bit dull, however; i've never particularly enjoyed his often overwrought acting style. i give "the merchant of venice" an 8/10.
