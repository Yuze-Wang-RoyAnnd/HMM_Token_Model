i was into the movie right away. i've seen the other coen movies, with the exception of raising arizona, and i've noticed that each of their movies has a color. fargo is gray/white, lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.<br /><br />the bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away. soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music. it's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life. enjoyed by everyone, chain-gangs, church choirs, and even prison escapees.<br /><br />now, about the prison escapees. i don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed, as they are a very very friendly group of guys. clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role.<br /><br />go see this as soon as possible. i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level. for some reason, the theater i was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it.<br /><br />you'll love it too, i promise. i was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away.
