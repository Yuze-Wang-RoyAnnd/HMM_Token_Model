this is speculation. this movie could of inspired paramount pictures to film the movie the core. both movies have something in common nature.the only improvement for inferno is a better cast. inferno's cast is still good though. excellent movie 8 out of 10. this is worth watching. this movie does have truth to it heat waves are real. another piece of truth is heat related power outages. where i live i have actually heard transformers blow. unrest from heat is possible because people seeking to cool off may get rowdy. there is a considerable amount of team work in this movie. again this a movie worth watching. the movie has a good cast. the movie has no slow spots.
