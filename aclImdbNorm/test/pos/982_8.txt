this movie is really an entertaining, good clean fun movie, for the kiddies. kaley(played by nickelodeon's talented amanda) is the sidekick to a rambunctious boy who has a hard time telling the truth. he eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen. i won't bore you with the details. if you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie, i highly recommend this one.
