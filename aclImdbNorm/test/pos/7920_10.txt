this is being commented on only because serge prokofiev(1891-1953)may not of known at first just how powerful a score and how actually majestic these lyrics really are.if you read the lyrics to alexander nevsky op.78 there is nothing here that is less than a witness through the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores in all of musical literature.this film with its accompanying score have a special place in the world and that may be just as true on the internet as anywhere.the composers own website which is underwritten by his estate provides for additional care given such a score as this score truly deserves.it is to me as deep as it is wide with such boldness that you wish to be the one,the one they called great novgorod!this is a song about alexander nevsky.yes,it happened on the river neva-on the river neva,on the wide waters.there we slew our foes'pick of fighting men-there pick of fighting men,the army of swedes.ah!how we fought,how we routed them!ah!smashed their ships of war to kindling!in the fight our blood was freely shed for our great land,our native russian land.hey!where the broadaxe swung was as an open street,through their ranks a lane where spears ran!we mowed down the invading swedes like feather-grass grown on desert soil.we shall never yield native russian land.they who march on russia shall be put to death!rise against the foe,russian land,arise,rise to arms,great novgorod!(the call to arms goes on)arise to arms,ye russian folk,in battle just,in the fight to death,arise,ye people free and brave,defend our fair native land!to living warriors high esteem,immortal fame to warriors slain!for native home,for russian soil,arise ye people,russian folk!in our great native russia no foe shall live.rise to arms,arise,native mother russia!no foe shall march across russian land,no foreign troops shall raid russia,unseen are the ways to russia.no foe shall ravage russian fields.(here dear reader we are asked to live forever with the following verse)titled"the field of the dead"-i shall go across the snow-clad field,i shall fly above the field of death.i shall search for valiant warriors,my betrothed,my stalwart youths.here lies one felled by a wild saber,there lies one impaled by an arrow.from their wounds blood fell like rain on our native soil,on our russian fields.he who fell for russia in noble death shall be blest by my kiss on his dead eyes;and to him,brave lad,who remained alive i shall be a true wife and a loving friend.i'll not be wed to a handsome man,earthly charm and beauty fast fade and die.i'll be wed to the man who's brave,give ye heed to this,brave warriors!(now to its conclusion with nevskys entry into pskov)in a great campaign russia went to war.russia put down the hostile troops.in our native land no foe shall live.foes who come shall be put to death!celebrate and sing,native mother russia!in our native land foe men shall not live.foes shall never see russian towns and fields;they who march on russia shall be put to death! in our russia great,in our native russia no foe shall live!celebrate and sing,native mother russia!all of russia came in triumph to the celebration.celebrate and rejoice,russian motherland!- it should be noted that prokofiev was under quite a bit of pressure from stalin, to if you will, make good.this musical score was really very much approved of by stalin.to me there is a unmistakable beauty in how we love this world and nevsky tells of a hero whose god like attributes provides for all participation in that love.a truly beautiful and furtive telling of the story of alexander nevsky.
