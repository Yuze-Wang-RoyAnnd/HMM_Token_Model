<br /><br />giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of edgar poe's tales. probably not a masterpiece, but it does leave us with the remembrance of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion, and a sentence that says it all : the wolves are coming. giorgino is quite forgotten now, and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it. that's a shame. if you ever have a chance to see this, well... give it a try.
