man, i really enjoyed this, if only for fred willard's commentary at the dog show. there are some dead spots and some gags that don't work, but overall the film works very well. when i was younger, my parents bred dogs and the people that i met at those shows were not significantly less bizarre that the freaks at this show, i can assure you.<br /><br />i enjoyed this film for its artistry and for its commentary about how we tend to take frivolous things far too seriously... i enjoyed the acting for its accuracy (most of the accents were flawless) and its subtlety (i loved the way each person walked their dogs)...<br /><br />rent this film if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence.
