saw this at newport beach film festival the other day. the film is really exceptional. the crowd i went with all loved it. funny, poignant and great acting. i'm tired of the tried and true hollywood romances, who can relate? david krumholtz (max) is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra-screwy grace (natasha lyonne, who is also excellent). when max falls for grace we believe it. why? because love at first sight is crazy and we're dealing with two lost, and maybe not so crazy, souls. also of note are giullmo diaz as hector and rosanna arquette as a sexless/sexy neurotic, both "roommates" of max and grace before they embark on their trip to sheboygen, wi and finding themselves. don't miss this one, its something special! p.s. the soundtrack, led by kevin hearn (of bare naked ladies fame) is really super super cool as well.
