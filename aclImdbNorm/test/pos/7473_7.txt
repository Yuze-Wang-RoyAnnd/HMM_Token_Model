i don't know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released, but it slipped by them unnoticed. it is well written, witty, satirical, and thoroughly enjoyable. it's like a video game brought to life. you never know who's behind the door or what will happen next. the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effect.<br /><br />one last word: for you mickey rourke fans...the mickster is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end.
