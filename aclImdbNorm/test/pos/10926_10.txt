i've watched many short films in my day. often i find them either too compressed (throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run), too "artsy", or lacking a clear-cut vision. i can say none of these things about starcrossed. in this review, i'll do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers, but i'll also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is brotherly incest.<br /><br />as with any short film, the story is fairly simple, straightforward and easy to digest. it's clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern society's most deeply held taboos. this film succeeds in every respect. in the fifteen minutes of running time, i found myself feeling a gamut of emotions. with only a little dialog, the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brothers.<br /><br />from the opening scene set in their early childhood, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. when the film progresses to the present day in the next scene, the excellent acting and honest, heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way. as the relationship progresses, any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution. and the aftermath of that resolution is heart-rending.<br /><br />anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message. if nothing else, it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs on the shame-filled and secretive taboo of incest. though the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates in the viewer long after the credits roll. this is perhaps my favorite short film i've ever seen. i can't recommend it highly enough.
