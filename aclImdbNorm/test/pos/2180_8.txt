five star final was one of the best films of the early 1930s. it starred edward g. robinson and was a very gritty story about a sleazy newspaper and their willingness to do anything...anything to sell newspapers. in particular, an old story of an innocent woman is plastered across the pages and helps to destroy her now happy life--many years after she was inadvertently involved in a scandal. the reason i loved the film so much was that it was unflinching and pulled no punches--showing just how low the publishers can be to sell papers.<br /><br />here in two against the world, it is a remake of five star final--with a few changes. instead of robinson, this film stars humphrey bogart and he is the head of programming at a radio station, not a newspaper. otherwise, the story is essentially the same--except that it's a bit less edgy and lacks some of the grit and sensationalism of the original. this isn't to say the film is bad--it just doesn't pack quite as good a punch as the first film. in other words, if you must see one of these films, see the first--though this film is quite powerful and enjoyable as well. as for me, i loved the story so much, i saw both films and enjoyed them both.<br /><br />two against the world begins with the ubc radio owner complaining to his programming head (bogart) that all the "high brow" shows he's put on are getting low ratings. the owner demands muck--lots of muck in order to get more listeners. one way they discuss is to do a multi-part dramatization of a famous killing that occurred two decades ago--even though the killer was acquitted and she killed only in self-defense. however, they decide to play up the story as if she was guilty and they even go so far as to both send a writer to the lady's home pretending to be a minister(!) as well as broadcasting her current name and whereabouts. needless to say, this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy. then, and only then, does bogart feel any real remorse for producing such garbage--leading to a dandy finale about journalistic integrity and decency.<br /><br />well-acted, a great story idea and a message that is just as important today as it was back in the 1930s, this is one story you have to see. in particular, notice the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene where the daughter attacks the owner and bogart---it is one heck of a great example of acting and writing.
