sacha baron cohen is a genius. and this movie is good! although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! i've liked ali g since the first time i saw the material from the show. i think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, peter dragon ("action") and the blues brothers. biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (dance and gambon). after this i will absolutely respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this chance. i have nothing really bad to say about this film, it's very funny. very juvenile, but hey, so what?! <br /><br />one more thing to mr. g: sequel, please!<br /><br />**** / *****
