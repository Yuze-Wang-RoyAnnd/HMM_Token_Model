i did not know what to expect when i decided to watch this documentary. i knew it was about an ex-viet nam pow in laos who escaped, but i didn't know much else. in reality, i wasn't expecting too much. oh what a surprise! the story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that dieter himself tells most of the story himself. dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. his personality really shines. he tells his story about his life growing up in germany during wwii and the hardships. we are there with him in that same small town as he describes his family, inspirations, and struggles. we follow him to america and his path to fulfilling his dream to be a pilot. then later dieter describes his story of capture, escape, and survival in the laotian jungle. we are again with him in that very jungle as he describes and re-enacts his imprisonment and path to freedom with great detail. we see the same primitive huts, villagers, and forms of detainment he dealt with that really hasn't changed for 30 years. we see the thick jungle, mountain terrain, and rivers dieter faced during his escape. it helps us to understand his emotions, pain, and plight. i enjoyed the man, the story, and the style. job well done!
