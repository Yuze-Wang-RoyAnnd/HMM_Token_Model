unlike most people who've commented, i was born after the last sylvester mccoy episode and so couldn't have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first. i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series. i have, since then, seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate to continue. the 21st century doctor who's are great, i thought martha was great, almost a match for the doctor and if jack's appearance is anything to go by, she's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5.<br /><br />speaking of jack, the spin of, torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes (though this is definitely more suitable for kids). however, if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't doctor who, please, just stay in your basement.<br /><br />10/10
