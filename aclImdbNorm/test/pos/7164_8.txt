i originally saw this movie as a blockbuster vhs rental. that was quite some time ago, but still remembered it. blockbuster doesn't have it anymore. netflix didn't have it and there weren't many copies on the web -- only a few spendy vhs copies. recently did finally find it available in dvd form on ebay for a reasonable price (in pal format, but our dvd player will play pal discs on our ntsc tv).<br /><br />wife and i both enjoyed it. the style of the movie is a bit strong, and many if not most of the parts are rather strongly over-played as if amateurs were making it(especially the kids), but it's not bothersome. the contrasts of societies are accentuated in the overplay.<br /><br />there is a bit of political preaching in terms of saying that the young in russia shouldn't try to escape their not-so-great life but instead should at least try to make things better first. but that's not dominant. it's fairly humorous most of the time.<br /><br />some downplaying of the west commented upon by others isn't that at all imo, i take it as a comment about expectations of the russian characters. at least when taken from my western viewpoint. perhaps it's a downplay of the west from a russian viewpoint (which it is literally by the characters saying it).<br /><br />i can't say how literally true to the film the english subtitles are, but i can say that the subtitles were done very well, full of english idioms as if done by a native english speaker -- complete with "colorful" language.
