you cannot be seeing the same movie if you didn't grow up in france (or spent at least 10 years there, like me). i don't know if it will ever make it outside french cultural borders (i include belgium and luxembourg here). you cannot translate its kind of fun - every name is joke (how many people outside paris would understand the pun in "couloirdebus", the name of one of the roman legionnaires ?). however monica bel(l?)ucci is so beautiful, i almost forgot to breathe when i saw her.
