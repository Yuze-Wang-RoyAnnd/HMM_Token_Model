scooby doo and the monster of mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern scooby doo animated features. loch ness monster is a considerable improvement.<br /><br />this time the gang head off to scotland to see the highland games and visit blake castle, daphne's ancestral home. and wouldn't you know, the castle happens to be in the 'quaint' fishing village of drumnadrochit, on the shores of loch ness.<br /><br />during their stay they meet a few interesting folks. first there is fiona pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the loch ness monster.<br /><br />sir ian locksley, the boss of the national heritage museum of scotland, he is staunch non-believer of nessie.<br /><br />the haggarts, the own a cozy inn on the shores of the loch. the sons are a couple of local jokers, always into mischief.<br /><br />del chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her.<br /><br />and finally, duncan macgubbin, the dock master who has seen nessie too many times to count.<br /><br />most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression. however if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright. being from scotland i can't help but wince at the awfully mimicked scottish accents. fact: we don't sound like that.<br /><br />soon enough nessie, looking rather more demonic than 'usual', shows up and causes havoc. looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. the usual chase scenes, clues and shaggy's wacky disguises follow. there are plenty of laughs. the animation is splendid, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. and the plot a lot better than monster of mexico.<br /><br />the only bad thing this time around is the music. i miss louis febre's scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too. where are the hex girls when you need 'em?<br /><br />the region 2 dvd is in crystal clear 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (the region 1 ain't) with dolby 5.0 sound. some okay extras are included. definitely worth getting.
