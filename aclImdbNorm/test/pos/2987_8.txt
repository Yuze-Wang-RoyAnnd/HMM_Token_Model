most of these reviews are dead on, so i'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions i've seen on here.<br /><br />while the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. here in the usa, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.<br /><br />i'm sorry not to have seen more by sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused. anicee had a healthy career, who's life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late 2006. she was a beautiful and talented actress.<br /><br />vhs tapes of friends can be found at amazon.com occasionally, but usually for a significant price; i've seen it as low as $60 or so and as high as $152 (as of this comment, there were two for that price). the sequel video paul & michelle is not quite as pricey and can be obtained (when available) on amazon for between $16 and $70 on average.
