this film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the battle of stalingrad, obvious when one compares this film to works such as anthony beevor's book "stalingrad".<br /><br />unlike the better known "enemy at the gates" where the plot diverts into a sniper/hunting story, this film shows what war can do to individuals. although filmed by germans, "stalingrad" is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film. it shows that war films can be something beyond flag-waving, jingoistic distortions of the grim truth of war, like so many hollywood "war" products seem to be.<br /><br />the scripting, acting, direction and other film techniques in "stlingrad" are of the highest caliber.<br /><br />it's a must-see film for anyone contemplating to join an army and to obey orders from any type of "fuehrer".
