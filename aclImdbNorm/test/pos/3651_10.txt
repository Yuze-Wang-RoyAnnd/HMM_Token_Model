sit back and let director bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of india. when was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? this movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in india. if you didn't want to visit india before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. this movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. but it has a lot more. thanks, bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale. i loved the ending. we women don't want illusions in life, we want reality. p.s. i was carolyn's friend at the sonoma film festival and met you briefly. good luck with your distribution efforts and i'm talking up the movie a storm.
