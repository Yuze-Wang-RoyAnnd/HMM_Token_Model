i remember this film of old. it's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. and there are even stranger events taking place out back, in hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "the shining." but the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. i certainly didn't see it coming. this is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly loopy, bordering on laughable. i'd recommend it to anyone.
