susan sarandon is, for lack of a better word, incredible. in my opinion (and yes i do understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses ever and should have at least 2 oscars to her credit. i mean, that was an amazing performance in lorenzo's oil (but then i think every performance of hers is amazing) and they gave it to emma thompson...what was that about??? and by the time she got this oscar, she'd been in the industry for some 25 years. i couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more, especially for a performance as brilliant as her portrayal of sister helen prejean. but then again, she is over and above all the artificiality of hollywood and doesn't need an oscar - people know she's good anyway.<br /><br />this film carries some very deep, thought-provocing messages, so needless to say it is not to be taken lightly. tim robbins, of course, can't escape credit here. you would think that, because of his person feelings against the death penalty, the portrayals made in this movie wouldn't be accurate. however, both sides of the death-penalty debate are given even weight. on one side, you see the interesting side of matthew, the human side which makes witnessing his death rather heart-wrenching. at the same time, you see the way he savaged his victims and the constant torment of the understandably grief-stricken parents. one word for tim - bravo.<br /><br />a brilliant movie and, like i said, a well-deserved and long awaited oscar for susan.
