a dozen bored surfers, mostly kids in venice, california, not only reinvent the skateboard but remake a once-forgotten-about suburban fad from the 1950s into an action sports revolution.<br /><br />narrarated by sean penn, dogtown depicts life in the more rundown "locals only" beach communities circa 1974, which consisted of mostly of surfing in the early morning tides and loitering. the zephyr team (or z-boys as they are called) spend one summer combating the boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local who owns a surf shop. after they enter re-emerging skateboarding competitions in socal, they transfigure it all into their own scene; one that rouses a generation of skateboarders consisting of greats like tony hawk, shaun white and the creators of the of x-games.<br /><br />dogtown puts chronological perspective into skateboarding, and the up-from-the-bootstraps history you never knew it had.<br /><br />from andy frye at mysportscomplex.blogspot.com
