yes, at times "unconditional love" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. in fact, it wasn't until i watched the film for the second time that i began to understand what i think p.j. hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which grace (kathy bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film. grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. so i watched "unconditional love" again with that in mind. i laughed much more than i did the first time, i became more involved with the characters, i began to understand the, at times, absurd turns the story takes. the performances are often over the top but no more than they need to be to fit hogan's weird and whacky vision, a vision which moved me to tears, yearning and outbursts of side-splitting laughter. yes, hogan is asking a great deal of his audience. but i for one have come to truly love his film -- unconditionally.
