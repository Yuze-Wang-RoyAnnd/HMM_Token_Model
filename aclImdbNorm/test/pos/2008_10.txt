this young filmmaker has a talent for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts. the concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well-executed and the soundtrack is very good.<br /><br />the decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts the onus on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode. i only wish all motion pictures had this kind of commitment to keeping their audiences entertained throughout their stories.<br /><br />highly recommended.
