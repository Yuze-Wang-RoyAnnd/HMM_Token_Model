my dad had this movie as an 8mm reel. i loved it when he would pull out the projector, tape a sheet to the wall, and play gerald mcboing boing. the thought of a child who communicated through sounds fascinated me.<br /><br />nine years ago, my son was diagnosised as autistic. the doctors would ask me questions about my son such as "how does he communicate with you?" i would respond, "have you ever seen the cartoon, gerald mcboing boing?" i would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators, this is how my son see he's world.<br /><br />recently, i spoke with a digital transfer specialist who indicated most personal 8mm films did not contain sound until the mid 1970's. i guess i was pretty lucky to have experienced the sights and sounds of gerald mcboing boing in 1972.
