andreas arrives in a strange city. he doesn't remember where he came from and how he got there. he is ordered to arrive at work, and gets his own apartment in the city. all his co-workers are nice and polite to him, they say hi and smile when they pass by him. but then later on andreas discovers that the city isn't that pleasant as it seems. going home from work, he see some people wearing grey suits, cleaning up the bloody mess of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim that had thrown himself out of the window. the procedure is done with a calmed mind, as if they were emptying a trashcan. the following day, andreas meets the suicide victim fully alive at work. more and more andreas discovers the feelingless atmosphere of the city.<br /><br />den brysomme mannen might be the best norwegian film i've seen. original, artistic directing is usually missing in norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. the plot is also very original, and could even be called post-modern horror, as the film present us a terrifying thought of having to cope with a world that is completely feelingless. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. i am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a disembovled universe, a nightmare, that you simply cannot escape from, not even with death.<br /><br />go see it, its really worth it! i gave it 9 out of 10.
