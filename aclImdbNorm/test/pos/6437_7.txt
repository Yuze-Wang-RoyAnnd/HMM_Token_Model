i first saw this film when i was about 6 ish - my grandma thought it'd be a nice kiddies film to entertain me and keep me occupied....however, every time i watched it i had nightmares the same night. yes it masquerades as a kids' film, but even now i find it really dark in places, particularly the haunting music that is played each time the guardian angel woman is on the screen, and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice. the actual "baddies" of the film, ie the sharks, mr grimes etc didn't scare me at all, i just always found the whole film rather creepy and dark. this is obviously something i can appreciate now that i'm 21 years old, but speaking from experience there is no way i would show it to my kids!
