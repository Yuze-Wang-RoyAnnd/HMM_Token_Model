i was going to use 'the german scream' as a summary but that was already taken lol. it sums up anatomy nicely. provided you're not alien to reading subtitles, anatomy fits in snugly with the scream/urban legend pack. it's a teen-horror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab. cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy.<br /><br />provided you're watching the original german language film (i can't comment on the dub, having not seen the english edition) anatomy is sharply written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up. in comparison to it's american counterparts, the mystery is uncovered much faster, meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal, anatomy evolves during it's running time from a slasher-come-body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller. it's a gripping ride from start to finish.<br /><br />hats off to the actors involved as well. franka potente proves once more that she's an intelligent, smart actress who can make any role come to life. her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from. the spooky lecturers and their teachers pets are equally good, a truly foreboding presence at all times.<br /><br />it's also astounding that the movie doesn't drag much. the pace is fast and punchy, very similar to the earlier urban legend, meaning that there's always something going on to keep your attention high. if there's one downside it could be that some will find anatomy too gruesome for them, but if you persevere through the first half's admittedly graphic dissection sequences, the latter half with it's exciting thriller overtones will reward you. i recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teen-horror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter.
