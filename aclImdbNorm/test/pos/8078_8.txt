being a bills fan, i originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the bills and the losing of four superbowls. but once i began to watch, i felt really connected. it was actually nice to see the "bills" win the superbowl, and i must say, that for a tv movie it was actually very well done. gil bellows as the qb, and jon voight as the old-school coach did a very fine job. 8 out of 10
