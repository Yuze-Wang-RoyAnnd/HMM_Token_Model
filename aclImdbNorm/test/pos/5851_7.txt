rating: 7 out of 10. directed by barbet schroeder. if you like hitchcock's `rope', then you will like this movie. `murder by numbers' stars sandra bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective cassie mayweather. her partner is sam kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by ben chaplin. <br /><br />the teenage killers are high school students richard haywood (ryan gosling) and justin pendleton (michael pitt). these young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.<br /><br />the supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. the movie reminds me of various `hitchcock' movies crossed with the tv show `law and order'. we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't.<br /><br />the other plot in the movie relates to cassie mayweather's past and incarcerated ex-husband. most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but i found this to the most intriguing part of the story.<br /><br />`murder by numbers' is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should i say dangerous, murder mystery. for more thrills and suspense, try `se7en' or hitchcock's `dial m for murder'.
