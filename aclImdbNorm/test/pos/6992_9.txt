people who thought that the chronicles of riddick sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up event horizon, probably didn't see the movie that spawned vin diesel's skin-headed killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. too bad, because pitch black actually does kick major ass.<br /><br />directed by genre vet david twohy, (warlock and the excellent but underrated below) and written by siblings jim and ken wheat (lies, silent scream), pitch black begins with an 'alien'-esque prologue. when a combination cargo freighter/passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, carolyn fry (silent hill's radha mitchell) has an important decision to make: ditch the cargo or the passengers? close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action.<br /><br />no matter, because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony. amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers, shazza (farscape's claudia black) and zeke (john moore); an imam (keith david) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named paris ogilvie (lewis fitz-gerald); a 'young boy' named jack (rhianna griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a marshall named johns (the excellently slimy cole hauser) and his prisoner...a dangerous murderer named riddick (diesel). <br /><br />how the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away. but no one here gets out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, than how they'll survive when they discover the unthinkable. they are not alone on the planetoid. things that are hungry, taloned and quick are slithering around just where they can't be seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. they want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites, but they can't come out into the searing daylight to forage for food.<br /><br />does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? you betcha. hence the more-than-fitting title.<br /><br />vin, more monosyllabic than clint eastwood's dirty harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two, and hauser, oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad wings was at on-screen villainy. surprisingly, though, mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as fry. you would expect no less than a strong showing from black, she who once was 'aeryn sun', and she doesn't disappoint. (too bad her role wasn't bigger, but that's all i'll say about it.) and david makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of hell itself.<br /><br />the pace moves faster than riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never let up, pretty much as in other classic sci-fi/horror flicks which this imitates. but if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, dave twohy and the wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance, and for giving us an ending that is anti-hollywood to the max.<br /><br />i don't want to spoil the surprises, so i won't say much more, except that if you saw chronicles first and weren't too happy, give pitch black a chance anyway. and if you've seen neither, definitely start with this one. <br /><br />i don't know what vin is up to now, but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again. i'd love to see what they would dream up next...
