i thought i was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. but at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of aparna sen, i decided to turn up for the movie. going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos i had seen king kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly i wasn't complaining. <br /><br />a great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on shabana azmi and konkona sen sharma's part. shabana azmi a divorc'ee who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister. konkona sen sharma a schizophrenic(spare me the spelling), who imagines thing all the time. rahul bose also gives a stellar performance. <br /><br />the story is that mithi (sen sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after getting brutally raped on her field job as a reporter, her levels really increase, her fianc'ee leaves her, for the person she became. in all her world comes down upon her. shabana azmi, her elder step sister, takes care of her, and mithi in her imagination believes that she has been married to her fianc'ee, has 5 children and they stay in 15th park avenue (which really is a place in new york). the plot goes on as mithi becomes suicidal, as she believe no one believes her and she is being held captive in her home from her husband. as fate would have, mithi and her fianc'ee meet up when they both are out on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fianc'ee has no existence in her real world, she cant recognize him. her fianc'ee, now married and a father of two children feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and he promises to take her to park avenue. and he does. he takes her to a place in kolkata which supposedly looks like her husband's home. as joydeep/jojo(rahul bose), her fianc'ee is talking on his cell phone he loses track of mithi. everyone comes looking for her but she is nowhere to be found. she finally gets what was denied to her, her family, her own imaginative family in her own world at 15th park avenue.<br /><br />i must say, that it touched my heart. i myself am now a fan of aparna sen's direction. the camera work is superb. and the quality of performance is spell bounding. konkona sen sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child. shabana azmi gives another mind blowing role as the divorc'ee elder sister, who has the load of keeping the family. rahul bose, another neat and quiet role(i don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks, he has so much potential). lastly aparna sen, she still captivates the audience, even if she is not in front of the camera and behind it. <br /><br />a very well deserved 8/10....
