i just witnessed a movie that by all rights should have been fodder for a second rate mow on lifetime...but trust the irish to keep it from being anything but saccharine. the set-up all but screams "here's a message concerning what's truly important in life" but the execution was way into the "let's see just what we can get away with, here."<br /><br />it helps to have two fantastic actors in the leads -- james mcavoy (as rory) and stephen robertson (as michael). while rory is offered up as the near saintly one -- never mind the language and attitude, he's the "life force" in this piece and could easily have been insufferable in his ultimately "caring" attitude -- mcavoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being too sweet. but the revelation is stephen robertson as michael. not since leonardo di caprio in "...gilbert grape" has anyone so perfectly captured a person with an affliction that i began to believe he really was an actor with cerebral palsy. and his eyes...my god, he can rip you apart with them.<br /><br />this movie is, to paraphrase rory, f****n' amazing. go see it. take a box of kleenex and enjoy every well-earned tear...and laugh.
