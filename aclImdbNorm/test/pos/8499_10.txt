my wife wanted to see this movie and i grudgingly went along. i have never been a big fan of the biopic - believing that cinema is more exciting when it isn't structured in non-fiction. beyond that, although i like ray charles' music just fine, i don't consider myself a fan of him or his music.<br /><br />i expected to either suffer or coast through this movie.<br /><br />i was wrong.<br /><br />this is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style. the realism is in the nuances - the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing. i literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it.<br /><br />jaime foxx, of which much has been said, heads a cast of immaculate re-creators of not just a time, but an era, a life that never really existed to those of us under forty. this movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of titanic or other period pieces of that ilk. this movie doesn't present you with the 50's and 60's music scene, it takes you there.<br /><br />this is a movie about ray charles, but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life. this is the kind of movie, like saving private ryan or schindler's list, that does what a movie should do - bring you to another place, another time.
