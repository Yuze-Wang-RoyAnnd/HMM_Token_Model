caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. people have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not caddyshack.<br /><br />i would begin by saying that we should just take caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but i think that would be unfair. the movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. the class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. the two things that are truly lacking here are bill murray and rodney dangerfield, who are replaced with dan ackroyd and jackie mason respectively.<br /><br />now i am not about to try and argue that ackroyd comes close to murray in the movie, but jackie mason is an admirable successor to dangerfield. he comes off as a cross between dangerfield and arnold stang, but without biting too heavily on either. i wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as dangerfield is in caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.<br /><br />chevy chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. for my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.<br /><br />while i'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. it comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.<br /><br />characters are similarly hammered home, particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. jackie mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! the director is clearly not of the same school of thought as harold ramis. not to suggest that caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.<br /><br />all things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on imdb, check it out for yourself.
