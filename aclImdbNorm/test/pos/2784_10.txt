a young frenchman uproots himself as he becomes an erasmus exchange student in barcelona and comes back a better man. sounds boring? no way! the movie is filled with colourful people, all of them stereotypes (the british twat and her racist brother, the sexually liberated dane, the ultra-organised german,...). in this case though, the stereotypes are brilliantly done. you feel like you know people like that (i for one know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and they're just like the characters in the film!), they feel like real people!<br /><br /> go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
