although it has been a failure in movie theaters because mainly mylene farmer, one of the 3 top stars in france had not the first role. fans had changed their mind after that and were waiting for it on dvd. when it has been released on dvd this year it has have a tremendous success ! the others fails was the slow pace and the incredible length (3h) at that time (1994) that have annoyed critics. but the melancholic story makes mandatory that slow pace and long time. the moral of the film is you cannot escape from the death you are destined for. it is the same theme than in the movie "final destination" and makes it a gothic tale. the atmosphere is very melancholic.
