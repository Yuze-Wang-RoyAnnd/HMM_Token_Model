it's interesting that someone made a comparison of the "fifth missile" to the star trek episode. it should be pointed out that the original star trek tv episode in which the crew of the enterprise undergoes a space madness while orbiting planet si 2000 is entitled "the naked time", not the "naked now". the "naked now" refers to the first regular star trek the next generation episode in which the enterprise-d encounters a science vessel. this episode, though, does refer to and is based on the "naked time" original series one.<br /><br />now, to the firth missile. while the reactions of the crew in the star trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication, the crew's condition on board the montana was caused by a much more serious situation, namely the paint vapors emitted by the faulty bulkhead finish. there are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a crew who has responsibilities as serious as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and of course this is what makes the film so suspenseful and such a thriller. the plot is very believable. at the same time, this film, along with "crimson tide", "the day after", "by dawn's early light", "the hunt for red october", "ice station zebra", and many other similar movies give us much insight into how easily things could go wrong and just how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin. thankfully such an event has not occurred and (god willing) such an event will not happen.
