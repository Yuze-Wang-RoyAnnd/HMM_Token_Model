bill paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments. but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.<br /><br />the acting is exemplary throughout. stephen dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco-irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment. for those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in "even stevens" this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.
