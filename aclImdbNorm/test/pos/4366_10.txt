yes, this movie was just hilarious and the acting was top notch from the whole cast. except shelley winters german accent wasn't that great but then that doesn't matter as she is hardly in the film. so if you're a fan of hers beware! the two main stars of this film are laurence harvey and julie harris. now before this film, i'd only see miss harris in east of eden with james dean and i own an audio tape of the glass menagerie that she did on stage with monty clift and jessica tandy, so i wasn't sure how she'd be in this role and boy, did she impress me. how hammy was she? i love ham! ;-) mr. harvey, he tickled my fancy! i am now a full time laurence harvey fan! that hair!!! *cackles* omg! it's almost like burt lancasters, that crazy messy look, it doesn't get better than that. he is young and so innocent in this film. see it now! it's definitely in my top ten! :) i am so glad i found a copy that is all mine! unfortunately this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video. :(<br /><br />btw, watch out for the hospital hotel room scene!!!!! it's one of the best parts! or when mr. harvey has convinced himself he's ill and he's trying to get his knee to kick, you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer ;-) well he does it himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table *squeals* check out the look on his face, so innocent!!!! i can't describe it but to all those people who say he couldn't act very well and other cockamamie comments, see this film and you will see what a great actor he really was. you'll be bowled over! if you aren't, then i'm afraid there is nothing i can do for you, you're hopeless. ;-)
