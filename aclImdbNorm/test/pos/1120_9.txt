one of my favorite movies. i like horses, i like happy endings, and i like walter matthau. i miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful. watch it with your kids (or your horse).<br /><br />the story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down on his luck. if you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline. it may be a little below "seabiscuit", but not a lot. the story is the same one, except it is the quarter horse version. well acted, correct racing terms and equipment, and nice racing scenes. don't take my word for it, get it and make up your own mind.
