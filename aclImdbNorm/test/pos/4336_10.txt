while i agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. bronson (paul kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like beruit). it's funny that people who associate with bronson have a habit of getting killed. bronson systematically kills them off one by one as the people in the neighborhood are used against him. there are some dynamics between bronson and fraker who leads the street gang, you can tell they both enjoy their work. at one point in the movie after they scuffle in the city jail, fraker say's, "i'm going to kill a little old lady just for you, catch it on the 6:00 news." the "giggler", a purse thief who laughs as he's committing his crimes is also enjoyable to watch. the movie was made in 1985 and most people probably could identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are cast in the movie. it's enjoyable watching bronson (paul kersey) rid the streets of these thugs. watch for the appearance of the wildey magnum, a serious piece of hardware that bronson wields. i also really liked the soundtrack to this movie.
