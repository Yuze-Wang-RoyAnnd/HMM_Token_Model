i was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip. although it started out slowly, i found that the realism in depicting the ship, the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching. the protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change on this voyage and i wanted to be there for it. i was not disappointed. the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in-between, often in the same scene, the same breath. there was a wealth of emotional overlaying, interaction and expression--relentless and compelling to observe. the movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes, making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next.<br /><br />edmund talbot is a complex character, the likes of which we don't see often. we may know where the captain stands or mr. prettiman, but they are older men, set in their ways. talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, testing himself and being tested. he struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched, that grew with each hard-taught experience. i appreciate the excellent characterization; it's too rare in movies and television.
