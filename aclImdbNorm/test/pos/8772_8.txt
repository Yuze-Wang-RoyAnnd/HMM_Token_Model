bob cummings is excellent in this, as this technically brilliant hitchcock film really does not get the fame as some of his other films but is very watchable even today. priscilla lane proves in this one that she can hold her own with other blonde's that worked with hitchcock later. she just did a handful of films after this which makes her almost forgotten today.<br /><br />there are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set ups in later films by the director. the acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today. every person in the cast performs well. there are several great backdrops in the black & white film.<br /><br />this was the first film at universal for hitchcock. long run between the feature films he did at universal, plus the television series, hitchcock would make as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there. this fact gets lost in film history.<br /><br />norman lloyd is well cast as the real bad guy in this film. the story moves along really well including hitchcock's only filmed western sequence. this film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it.
