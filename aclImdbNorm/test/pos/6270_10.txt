the ator series is a shining example of what b-movies should be. they fail in every aspect, but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad. "ator l'invincibile 2" aka "the blade master" aka "cave dwellers" shows us europe's favorite conan clone, ator where we left him in the first movie- after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film. this time the world must be saved from "the nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on screen as a bright light (i guess they couldn't afford a prop). this one features invisible attackers and samurai. as with the first film, lots of stock footage is used (including one rather obvious bit from "star wars"). thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad- this is an exception b-movie.
