if you're a "child of the eighties" like me, you probably remember this 1981 disney movie--one of disney's first pg-rated films, and michael j. fox's screen debut. i can remember watching this film over and over on hbo when i was on middle school, and i only recently found a very old copy of it, since disney stopped producing the movie several years ago. needless to say, this is a real fun movie to watch. five college teams decipher clues in an evening race around los angeles, trying to reach the finish line first. watch for the cameo from paul reubens. from the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins, this is a quintessential 1980s fun film that you'll love.
