a remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much, much younger. i loved it, and the elton john music. i remember seeing in in the movies when i was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) i've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.<br /><br />the dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, i confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush. a generational thing?<br /><br />why is it not on dvd?
