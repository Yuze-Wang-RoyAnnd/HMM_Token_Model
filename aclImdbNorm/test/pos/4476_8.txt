an excellent story well told by the film maker. the interactions between the man and the leopard brought many questions to the viewers mind about just who was being humane. the humans killed for no reason the animals only to survive. at the end of the movie you were left wondering just who the real "hero" of the movie was. a well told story. the human actor did an excellent job but the leopard stole every scene it was in.
