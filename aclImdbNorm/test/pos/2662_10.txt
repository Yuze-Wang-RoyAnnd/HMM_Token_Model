this movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. it is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. the story itself is quite simple at a first glance. as the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. this motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. the film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. it is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. the film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. i've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. but the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.<br /><br />the day i learned '2001' got only special effects oscar and was not even nominated for the best picture was the day when 'academy award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me.
