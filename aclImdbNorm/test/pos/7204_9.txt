i was lucky to see this sequel before the original because i'm not sure i would have gone out of my way to see it if the contrary had been true. i found "mission cl'eop^atre" better than it's predecessor for different reasons, but the major one is this : it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book not an amalgam like the first movie. the physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy (who's name is escaping me, but he's the other architect). i don't know how this movie played in english; my first language is french so i didn't have that problem... i imagine some of the jokes weren't that easy to translate. i've learned something with years it's better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said, but you wont lose the rhythm and i think that's important too. i would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "ast'erix et ob'elix".
