clearly patterned after the first gangster movies that warner produced the same year,little caesar (1931) and the public enemy (1931),this gangster movie is one of the better efforts i've seen. although not quite in the same league as the previous mentioned classics, it has a powerful performance by young sylvia sidney.she's magnificent and delivers her lines more natural than perhaps anyone did at the time.gary cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what would follow the next few years when he rose to the top. the movie has some fascinating villains in paul lukas (never seen him this detestable) and guy kibbee (what a shock to see him act the hoodlum).the direction of rouben mamoulian is very inventive,probably the first voice-over to show a persons thoughts appear in this movie. if you get the chance to see this little gangster flick, don't let the chance go by.
