over the years i seemed to have missed this picture of ronald reagan, and due to his recent passing to the big screen in heaven, it was shown on tv recently. this is a great low budget b&w film of the late 1930's, however, it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular time frame. i was surprised at the role ronald reagan,(eric gregg),"the killer's,'64, played in this picture, along with a great veteran film star, sheila bromley,(nona gregg),"nightmare circus",'73, who was a great supporting actor. it was a great film that showed ronald reagan as a very young man reaching for the stars in his career in hollywood at the time. god bless him !
