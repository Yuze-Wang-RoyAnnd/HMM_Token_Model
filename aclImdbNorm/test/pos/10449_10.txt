what looks like a ho-hum porky's rip-off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love.<br /><br />the story concerns three friends, gary, ricky and david, who spend their after school hours looking for sex. when a new girl arrives in town gary falls head over heels in love with her.<br /><br />the film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities. it is funny and sad at the same time. it never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made. you know the guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy gets girl back in the final frame formula. that formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl. maybe that is why i liked the film so much.<br /><br />the soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker. it also might be one of the most realistic endings i've ever seen in a love story.<br /><br />
