i love this movie. the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters. judith ivey did so well portraying a weak, fearful, dependent, who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self-involved character, that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. blythe danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental jewish mother, devoted wife, and loving sister. jonathon silmerman, bob dishy, stacey glick, and lisa walz performed their roles equally well.<br /><br />if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this movie.
