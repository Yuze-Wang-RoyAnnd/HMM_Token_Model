recently released on british dvd, this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly). not as depressing as it could have been, this is kitchen-sink at its most dirty. terrance stamp is great in it, the music is sweet, carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who can't stop loving criminals.<br /><br />my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her (the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye) sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk past.<br /><br />the only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carol's first husband, but if you can get past that, you're ok. and donovan provides some of the most languid, mellow, bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s.
