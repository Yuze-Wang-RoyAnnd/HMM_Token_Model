this was my first look at this short-lived british tv horror series, but i had seen a couple of hammer horror films (horror of dracula, captain kronos: vampire hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.<br /><br />this first episode was a shocker - not for the horror but for all the nudity. was this "regular" tv in england in 1980? if so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in north america. there were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. hey, i'm not complaining. <br /><br />the story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. the latter, jon finch as "david winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. she was be prunella gee as "mary." the husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.<br /><br />patricia quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "lucinda jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. as a man, i'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! this starts off slowly but once "lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.
