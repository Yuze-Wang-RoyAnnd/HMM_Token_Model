if it were possible to award a 10+ .... this would be the one film i would choose.<br /><br />i remember catching this film on tv many, many years ago - and fortunately being prepared enough to video it. now my video copy is getting old, video technology is outdated and i'm starting to worry that i may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer.<br /><br />as a wildlife film it is superb. as a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since. how can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? if such a thing as a lobby/pressure group exists to push for the re-release of this film, count me in and send me the details pronto.<br /><br />my guess is there's a mint to be made by anyone able to re-release this in today's market.
