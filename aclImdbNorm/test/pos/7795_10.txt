rajkumar santoshi tries his hands at comedy and succeeds. one of the few good movies that involves salman khan. a very funny movie from start to finish. all the characters contribute to the movie and believe me, there are a lot of them. aamir khan, salman khan, raveena tandon, karishma kapoor, paresh rawal, viju khote, jagdip, deven verma, shakti kapoor, harish patel, tiku talsania and more. the direction, editing, sound are not up to par, but that still does not matter, because the actors more than make up for that part.
