i saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it. i moved to norway four months ago, and have tried ever since to find the origin of the strange emptiness i felt. when i saw this film i was striken with the brilliant snapshot of this society. yes, this is all true!!! i too found a great job with a great pay, and i live with my norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment downtown. but, so far everyone i have met have left me with that tasteless, empty feeling i had never had before - this is what this movie is about. dinner parties with nothing to say to each other but emotionless comments, long silences, no stress, a creepy calm, and frozen smiles of niceness. this scandinavian nightmare is perfectly rendered in den brysomme mannen. see this movie!!!
