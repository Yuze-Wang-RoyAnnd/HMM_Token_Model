finally!!! a good movie made on the most demented serial killer in history. for those less familiar with ed gein, he was basically the madman who was known for grave robbing and skinning his victims (which most horror fans ripped off). shot in a period style that reflects the bleak plains of wisconsin perfectly, this is easily the most atmospheric horror film yet to depict gein and his gruesome killings. kane hodder (jason from friday the 13th series) and michael berryman (hills have eyes i & ii), deliver chilling performances in this serial killer opus that easily leaves behind the lackluster former gein attempts. so far i'd say this is one of the better horror films released this year (turistas = 0).
