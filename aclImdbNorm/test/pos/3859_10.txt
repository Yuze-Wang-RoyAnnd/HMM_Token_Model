as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, i adore aristocats. it is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the "best" kids movies these days. the story line is sweet and interesting. the music is great. the love story is quite romantic. the kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. the action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. the characters are quite well-cast as well. i love listening to eva gabor's velvety voice, and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well. it's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners, and faithfulness. who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values? it is a movie that i don't mind watching over and over, unlike happy feet where i couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating. i wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one.
