i believe, that this is a heart tugging film. richard donner (directed the top grossing film "superman"), had done a great job directing this film. some of the segemets were good, and several were horrible because, bobby (mazzello) was beatened by the king (baldwin, and especially their dog, shane attacked the king which meant that he paid for what he had done to bobby.<br /><br />elijah wood, portrayed a good role in this film. the memorable scene in this, he dreamt that he took the buffalo's advice about bobby being battered. lorraine bracco, (pre-soprano)had portrayed an impressing role.<br /><br />i give this film *** out of four!!!
