in the early 19th century, a young woman with a harelip falls foul of her family's ambition and the superstitions of the local community, but she meets a man who may see her differently, and just may, change pru's life forever.<br /><br />precious bane is a british broadcasting corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by mary webb. it's a beautifully filmed piece that is acted to an incredibly high standard, the story {screenplay by maggie wadey} is excellent, and the period detail and use of dialect is second to none. it's such a shame that this film has yet to get a dvd release, one would have thought that with clive owen's {great here as gideon} rise to stardom, the bbc would get it out there, but sadly no, so the only way of catching it is on the very rare occasions that tcm shows it. the lead performance from janet mcteer as pru sarn is simply brilliant, guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand as mcteer gives it her all. pru has to not only contend with her facial disfigurement, but also the constant snides and hurt from the ignorant villagers. this is a time when folk believed that if a hare ran in front of a pregnant woman it spelt doom, a time of bull baiting, a time of superstitions and talk of witches. in spite of constant set backs pru is strong and resourceful, even her own family knock her dreams back without realising it, but this road may well be a terribly bumpy one, but hope is everlasting, and pru has hope in abundance.<br /><br />8.5/10
