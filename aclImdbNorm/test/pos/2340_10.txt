seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. mean, gripping, moody and captivating. every home should have a copy! don't take my word for it see it yourself. one life stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. john kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. this is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years. no car chases, but a film packed with hum our and emotion. i first saw this film screened at the edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on dvd.
