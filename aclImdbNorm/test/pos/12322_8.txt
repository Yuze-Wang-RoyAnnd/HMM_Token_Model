an exquisite film. they just don't make them like this any more! we eavesdrop on an upper middle class family in dublin in the early part of the 20th century. they are hosting an after christmas dinner for their friends and relatives. their table talk is just idle chatter but it is so well written that one is engrossed. away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests. perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film. no real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers.
