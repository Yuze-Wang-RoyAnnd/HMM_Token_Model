so it's a little dated now, it's almost 30 yrs old. amazingly enough i have this on beta tape and it still plays just fine. if it came to dvd i'd snap it up in a heartbeat.<br /><br />the drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then. then it wasn't as 'harmful'. much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. i can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this. i had coworkers in the 90's who'd seen it and i could bust them up by getting on the intercom and saying "iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy".<br /><br />great lines, great spoof of the original, and funny to me anyway even three decades later!
