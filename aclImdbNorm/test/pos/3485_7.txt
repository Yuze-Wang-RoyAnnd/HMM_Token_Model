due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in italy, at least) i didn't expect much from this movie. thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house ("la casa maledetta" means "the cursed house"). well, i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different... this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller! very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot... ok, i've tried not to spoil the viewing of "7 hyden park" for you, which i'd highly recommend to everyone. <br /><br />p.s. am i wrong, or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand (she's paralyzed from the waist down) her feet and legs move a little too much? (... and i'm not talking of the "bad dream" sequence.)
