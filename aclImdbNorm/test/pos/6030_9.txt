what makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? not kidding, i was watching it already 10 times or so and did not get tired. is it the tender melancholia throughout the whole thing? is it the similarity to classics like "niagara"? i was thinking a long time about that. and figured it out: i guess it is: there is no hero, there are only people. some try to be good. some gave up trying to be good. some are hopeless cases but carry still the spunk of being human inside. it is the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. one way the catastrophe is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidences. the other way this night reveals the logical consequents of this peoples lives because they are in a certain constellation cut off the rest of the world. it has something of a dostoevsky tale.
