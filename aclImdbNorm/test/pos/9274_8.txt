i was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite italian directors. d'amato has dabbled in everything from horror, post-apocalyptic to hardcore porn. he has touched upon genius a couple of times with films like buio omega and emmanuelle & the last cannibals. this documentary is a lenghty and informative guide to the films of d'amato. he is interviewed throughout with english subtitles rolling across the bottom of the screen. the excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator (with english subtitles). the documentary proved extra interesting when it analyzed the often censored "emmanuelle in america". here d'amato explaines the faked "snuff" scenes in detail and recalls some funny stories. in fact, good ol' joe is very warm and funny throughout, always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette. the one disapointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on d'amato's horror films like anthropophagus and the brilliant buio omega. it spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the post-apocaplyptic films. but, i can't complain. it is wonderful to see d'amato get the respect he deserves. highly recommended for fans of d'amato. may he rest in peace.
