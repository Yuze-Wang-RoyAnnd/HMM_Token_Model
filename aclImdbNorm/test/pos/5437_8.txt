actually i'll admit i'm a political junkie, so this resonated with me, but the erratic nature of ms. green (yes i know what they did to her), but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itself.<br /><br />why can't barry l and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do? let us debate it.<br /><br />instead they have this "oh i'm not worthy" bullshit ending and it just shows that when the chips were down it's better to leave the table instead of doubling down. stop the disney ending and putting a bow on it. life isn't easy, they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbone.<br /><br />we had to listen to the rhetoric the entire movie... and then it turned sniveling and the stupid, inane behavior by ms. green (when the crap was out of her system) just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was icing on the cake.
