all you need is great house, a babysitter and a phone. simon west directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original. this version is more of a thriller than a horror flick. emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. jill johnson(camilla belle)needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of dr. and mrs. mandrakis(derek de lint and kate jennings grant). the house is a beautiful 1970ish wood and glass masterpiece. secluded and peaceful. the kids are already in bed, the wind builds and is joined by down-pouring rain. the phone begins ringing, ringing, ringing. the babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone.<br /><br />belle is great as the innocent, smart and strong teen babysitter. the voice of the stranger on the phone is that of lance henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by tommy flanagan. also featured are: katie cassidy and brian geraghty. kudos to james dooley for the atmospheric original music.
