peter lorre was born to play stephen danel with lines like: "mr. smith, you shouldn't hold my wife like that." and "i told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" the poster for this film is an eerie green and peter lorre leers in way that makes you never want to go to his penal colony / island. this film is not available on dvd although it is a classic and very rarely shown on tv. what exactly is the relationship between stephen danel and the monkey? why does the monkey upset him so much. we will never know. the film should be colorized by someone and excerpts should be made into a kinks video. the film was re-released in the 1950s and only a few of the peter lorre biographies spend any text on this film. casablanca was right around the corner. bogart could have been on that island but they surely did not have the budget for him
