two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. the scenes of the corral in the town where ward bond and ben johnson negotiate prices, and bond introduces the idea of them (johnson and his partner played by harry carey jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with bond. once on the trail they come upon joanne dru, who maybe john ford saw in red river, and offered her a much better part in this film. in the morman train are a number of notable characters. the mormans are a peaceable group who are challenged along the way by a truly lowlife group of outlaws. in their case (the outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later a band of navajos whom they encounter, and in the well written characters played by ben johnson and ward bond, the film completely evades stereotypes, while the camera seems to spend as much time giving the viewer the big picture of monument valley framing the train as it moves along with a few water crossings along the way, in stunning black and white and then coming back to what's happening in this rolling community, all to the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the sons of the pioneers.
