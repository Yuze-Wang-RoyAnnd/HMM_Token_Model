alien warrior (or king of the streets) is one of those 80s gems you stumble across by mistake, then watch awestruck, marveling at how wonderfully silly and over the top it gets.<br /><br />a rather hunky alien arrives on earth (la to be exact) and stumbles into a world of drug dealers, gangs, and corrupt cops. he falls in love with the flaxen haired, beautiful teacher who only wants to help inner-city kids read more. he also manages to anger a coke-snorting drug kingpin who vows to destroy him.<br /><br />i fell in love with this film at first viewing... sure it's hokey, silly and low-budget. but you can tell the filmmakers had their heart in the right place, and damn if the thing doesn't work! i only pray it'll be on dvd soon.<br /><br />it's got a hot soundtrack, break-dancing, violence, nudity.... all with a positive, wholesome message! see it.
