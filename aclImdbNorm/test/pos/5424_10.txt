richard condie's utter maddness insanity cartoon 'the big snit', is a trip through qwerkyness, madness, hillarity, enjoyable backgrounds, melting characters, and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears everytime i see it.<br /><br />this short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it (luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on tv)!! it never stops to make me burst out in laughter uncontrollably, and then reach down into the depths of my spirit, highlighting the greatness of the human condition. <br /><br />cause when someone says, 'come on, let's finish the game' everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore. this film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour, but it is far more than that. this film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. <br /><br />it is flawless... in every way. and damn funny too ;)<br /><br />rating 10 out of 10.
