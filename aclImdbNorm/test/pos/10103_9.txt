two sisters, su-mi (im soo-jung) and su-yeon (moon geun-young) return home with their father (kim gap-soo). eun-joo (yeom jeong-ah) welcomes them but su-mi's manner is bitter to her. su-mi hates eun-joo because the father let her act like the house wife after the sisters' mother died. seeing her attitude, eun-joo is getting to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere among them.<br /><br />as if called in by the atmosphere, series of mysterious things occur in the house. when su-mi is hanging her dress in her wardrobe, there have been already hung a lot of dresses of the same design. when she put her diary into a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind there. when she is sleeping in her bed with scared su-yeon, a nightmare awakes her and she finds a woman standing on her -- and a hand dangles out of the woman's skirt!<br /><br />mysterious things occur to the other people, too. on the evening of next weekend, eun-joo's brother and his wife visit the family and they have a dinner together. eun-joo cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child, but nobody is interested in her talk. she says the crazy man annoyed the brother, but he says he doesn't know anything about the man.<br /><br />listening to their talk, the brother's wife has a panic.<br /><br />after the dinner, the conflict between eun-joo and the sisters becomes at its worst. eun-joo pulls su-yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it. su-mi saves the crying-out sister and complains to their father what eun-joo has done to his daughter. but his response is unexpected. "give me a break." says he angrily, "su-mi, please. don't make me tired any more."<br /><br />and the following words out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house.<br /><br />to tell the truth, i hate horror movies. although i seated myself at a theater because my intuition told me the movie was something different, i was regretting what my curiosity had made me act when it started showing. the regret, however, had changed into joy for expectation ten minutes later.<br /><br />this film is a tragic mystery more than a horror -- painful more than horrible; beautiful more than sensational. that may have a hard core horror fan disappointed, but for a mystery fan like me, this film is a must see.
