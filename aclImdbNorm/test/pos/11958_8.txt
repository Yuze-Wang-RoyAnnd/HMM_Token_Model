ok, so there's always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they're good, but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be, or whether they're from a foreign country. all that aside, one crazy summer is the perfect example of what a great american teen comedy should be. the jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la bobcat goldthwait), surreal (bobcat under the inspired direction of steve holland), and dry (john cusack, one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in american cinema), and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line (ok, except demi moore).<br /><br />yes, it's immature, yes, it's screw-ball, yes, bobcat dresses up like godzilla and trashes a scale-model of a seafood restaurant. it's also funny as hell. watch it.
