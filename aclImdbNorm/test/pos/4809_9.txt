i just purchased an zhan (running out of time) on dvd and it was an excellent film i must say. not really action-packed, in terms of gun play, but definitely exciting and witty. i do not think i have seen andy lau in better form. and the editing on this film was very well executed. go watch this now if you are a fan of lau or hk thiller/action film!
