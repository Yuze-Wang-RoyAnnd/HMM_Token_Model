i first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. it was a fun romp with some cool music. kristine was on the playboy cover, and the centerfold, as i recall. she's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. the movie made me want to see more of her and so i kept a look out for her in other stuff. she's in steven spielberg's "i wanna hold your hand" and barbara streisand's "the main event" and bill murray's "meatballs", plus lots of tv shows like night court and tv movies. me and my friends really enjoy her. but her starring role in alice in wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be, right on kristine as the center of attention, probably the prettiest, hottest girl i've ever seen in movies.
