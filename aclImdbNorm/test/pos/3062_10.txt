i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie! i thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen. it my have been b/c i am mel brooks biggest fan... i know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them, when it is played on a family channel. :) this is one of my favorite movies, so i dont know why any one would disagree! thanks kristina
