let's get it clear from the start: i am an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of cubic stone. therefore i consider dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or whatever ailments they have and cry on and on about it as stupid movies with poor taste. i mean, if you have a message, you can tell it without the help of sick or pitiful people.<br /><br />however, i liked this movie. it is about people with incredible bad luck as personal health goes, but they don't cry about it, quite the opposite, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care" of them by actively removing them from real life. the message is live life to the fullest, even if the ending is as sad as possible.<br /><br />my conclusion: as sick people dramas go, this one is a keeper. it is sad, yet hopeful. i like james mcavoy, even if he does seem to always play the arrogant rebel. i also say that steven robertson played very well. either that or he really has partial paralysis. :)
