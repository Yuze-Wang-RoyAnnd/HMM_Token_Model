i first saw heimat 2 on bbc2 in the 90's when i was at art college living and moving among artists and musicians, hoping for future success. so 'the second home' - of friendships made after leaving the familial home, of striving for a professional excellence - strongly resonated with my living reality. i was captivated by the characters, the storytelling, the lyrical camera-work and above all by the music. in it i could divine the beginnings of german electronic music, of 50's stockhausen, kraftwerk, can, neue, faust of the 70's, the sound experiments of john cage, walter carlos and the british electronic psychedelia of the white noise. the soundtrack composer nikos mamangakis studied with carl orff of carmina burana-fame so i found its tastes contemporary to the electronic pop/ sound effects world.<br /><br />i hadnt seen heimat or heimat 3 so i watched it as a whole in itself without a before or after. as someone else has commented, it is both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. many favourite moments including the wonderful voice of gisela muller (evelyn), the bach marimba of daniel smith (juan), the piano-playing of henry arnold (hermann) and the cello-playing of salome kammer (clarissa).<br /><br />i could write more but it's already been said here. why can't british or us tv produce such masterpieces ? the wire had the realism and politics and epic sweep of a city, david lynch and dennis potter had imaginative tropes to their serialised tv work too but this is art-house and soap at its most cinematic and narrative sublime. it's never included in critics' choices of best films but it should be. still as poetic and powerful as when i first saw it over 17 years ago. i watch the 3 boxed sets every autumn for their 'mellow fruitfulness'. inspired and inspiring.
