it was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film...grand champion. the story of a 12 year old boy (buddy) that with the help of his sister, mom and best friend is determined to raise a grand champion steer. it is a whimsical journey to the big competition. after hokey pokey is crowned, grand champion, he is auctioned for $775,000. to pay for the kids college education. buddy finds out that the next time he sees hokey....it would be on a bun! the kids conspire to steal the prize winning steer,vowing to save him from the bbq. this is where the fun begins...julia roberts, larry mahan, george strait, natalie maines, steven bland, tommy guy, tuff hedeman, and so many more stars create the backdrop for all the antics. you wont believe who actually won the steer at the auction!!! (he looks good in a mustache) the soundtrack is rich with tunes from george strait, natalie maines, willie nelson and more. where else can you experience movie stars, country & western stars and rodeo stars....only in texas...only in grand champion. <br /><br />it is masterfully crafted "simple" little film that may be the best movie you see this year. the movie opens in select cities on friday, august 27th. 2004.<br /><br />another great film from rope the moon and michaelson productions is in a whisper. keep an eye out on the cable networks for this one!
