this documentary focuses on the happenings in gothenburg 2001. in swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence. this movie shows that there not, actually they are intelligent, articulate people that has something to say - and says it by the force of bricks. they believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without being aimed at. but are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic? i think not.<br /><br />this documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed, capitalism and the future it might bring. it is a great documentary that is not propaganda, because it is not shown as what they say is right. everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong.<br /><br />i have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it, i think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief, all you get is more facts to rely on, for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a mcdonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think.<br /><br />overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen, that fought violence with violence, did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march (and in some cases beating people with truncheon, even though they are lying on the street without making resistance) where as good as it gets.<br /><br />rating: 8/10 - very good, but not best!
