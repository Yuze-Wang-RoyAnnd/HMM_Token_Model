i loved this movie!! jack black and kyle gass have probably made one of the best comedies since up in smoke. this movie has something for everyone: rock, drugs, and satan. what more could someone want? i suggest this movie to anyone that wants to sit back and forget all the trouble in the world and have a good laugh. even if the movie does not do well in the theaters it is sure to become a cult classic. i do suggest anyone going to see the movie pick up the d's first album because a lot of the jokes are made only funnier if you have heard the songs( such as jb's obsession with sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil.)the movie still is guarantied laughs even if you have not heard their music but the songs are so great you can't pass them up.
