iam not sure if discussing the television series is exactly where the comments should be drawn to,however it is on the television where the the lone ranger really made a name for himself.iam not even referring to the original radio broadcasts of this masked rider of the plains,iam though referring to a point where in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old,i was to see the movie,"the lone ranger"and never forgot it.i can recall that i was on a line or we were moving toward the paramount theater-the theater was located in the theater district,if i remember correctly.it was directly across,going east to west from the building that has the ball that drops on new years eve-this is of course if anybody doesn't know, new york city.high above the street on the roof tops there was a time and maybe even still today huge billboards would advertise what was being shown and so on.it was at that point in time that i looked up and was never more impressed as i was when i looked at that billboard to see the lone ranger across the roof tops-it was great-it made an impression and was never forgotten.that day we went to see the lone ranger-it was the story of how the lone ranger was born-the terrible ambush that the texas rangers rode into and the subsequent rebirth of one of its fallen heroes.it was in this film we learn that the lone ranger will not shoot to kill but to injure so as to let the law be the judge.that type of thinking is so worthwhile that we might be good to learn something from history.this is where we learn that tonto discovers the fallen ranger and upon seeing the symbol of the boyhood friendship that the lone ranger established years earlier when he as a younger person came to the aide of a injured young person in tonto-for the aide given, tonto gave to his faithful friend, a symbol of his thanks which now was part of a necklace that tonto recognized.tonto said,"you are kemosabe".the lone ranger said,"kemo-sabe,that is familiar?then tonto tells the story of this "trusty scout"(the meaning of kemosabe)i think the lone ranger is one of the true heroes of the silver screen and one of the great heroes of television.it should also be stated that these very respected individuals clayton moore and jay silverheels sought to live there lives according to the legend of the lone ranger-it may very well be that there is an inspiring story in the story of the lone ranger and his faithful companion tonto.i myself was so pleased by the ability to find and buy the dvds, that i stayed up all a saturday morning and watched the many episodes now available.long live the lone ranger and his faithful companion tonto-hi-ho silver-
