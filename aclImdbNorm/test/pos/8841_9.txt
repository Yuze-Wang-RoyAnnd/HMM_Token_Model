i first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on tv and i was up far too late... i really lucked out there though. it's truly incredible; from the location (as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet; it made "the abyss" look like et in the council swimming pool), through the interesting characters (keith david is especially good as the reactionary childs -"what if we're wrong about him?" - "then we're wrong.") and the effects (more yucky than alien).<br /><br />moreover, however, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. it's the people you start being scared of; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - "all they appear to be". it's certainly got the feel of "who goes there?".<br /><br />the soundtrack is great; it really plays up the isolation, fear, and gravity of the situation.<br /><br />finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts. even more than the "but then again who does ?" punchline of bladerunner. enough said.
