symbologist robert langdon (hanks) is called to rome to help decipher the mystery behind the illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.<br /><br />the da vinci code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of dan brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.<br /><br />having read the book, i was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed tom hanks and audrey tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the louvre but for angels and demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.<br /><br />having asked around, most people seem to prefer angels and demons to the da vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.<br /><br />this howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike da vinci, tom hanks' robert langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten illuminati in the vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats the da vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.<br /><br />the interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.<br /><br />this really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.<br /><br />just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.<br /><br />it is fair to say dan brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. as well as trying to discover the illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is again present. all interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.<br /><br />ron howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in da vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. his jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. he is certainly no paul greengrass and this is by no means bourne.<br /><br />slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than da vinci
