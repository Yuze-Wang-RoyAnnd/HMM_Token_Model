one of master director alfred hitchcock's finer films this is the story of an american and his family (james stewart, doris day, and their young son) who are vacationing in north africa. stewart is a doctor and day is a world famous singer. they meet a frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. later one, the frenchman whispers something into stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. the rest of the film is a puzzle as stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. the movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. you never really know what's going on in this film, why people are appearing, until the end and even then you're not sure. the final scene takes place in albert hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog. hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.
