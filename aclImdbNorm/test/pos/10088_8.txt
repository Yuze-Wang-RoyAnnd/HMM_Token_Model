what can i say about this film that won't give you any preconceived notions when you see it? very little. the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down. what follows after that is the movie. it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years. everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended. it is not a perfect film. the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story, even more confused.(if you've read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you'll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on) i'm not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have. if you like horror, and don't mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl.
