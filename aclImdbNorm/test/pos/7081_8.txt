this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen... the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn't drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep, who's performance was extraordinary. the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer. the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking. the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee. brava bette midler!! out of 5 stars, i give this one 4 1/2.
