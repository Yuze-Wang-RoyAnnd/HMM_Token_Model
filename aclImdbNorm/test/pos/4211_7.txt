they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film, the life of jimmy dolan which starred douglas fairbanks, jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.<br /><br />even with the restrictions now upon production by the hays office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. douglas fairbanks, jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. john garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.<br /><br />they made me a criminal was directed by busby berkeley who jack warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. berkeley in fact would soon be leaving warner brothers for mgm. <br /><br />berkeley does do a fine job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. i particularly like the scene where four of the dead end kids and garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. they get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.<br /><br />other performances besides garfield and the kids to remember are may robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and claude rains as the obsessed detective on garfield's trail.
