four holy young men from mormon country go to l.a. to preach the gospel to urban heathens. but, one of the young mormons is a repressed gay who "happens" to cross paths with a very "out" young l.a. party boy. (what would film plots be without coincidences?). these two, very different, young men become friends, and in the process, affect each other's outlook which, in turn, sets up an inevitable clash between gay and mormon cultures.<br /><br />that is the premise of "latter days", a 2003 film, written and directed by c.jay cox, himself a former mormon missionary. the film's story is, of course, highly relevant, especially in contemporary america. variations of this story need to be told, and retold, and retold, hopefully in future films ... because the underlying theme brings to light the hatefully superior attitude that christian fundamentalists too often display toward gays. by its nature, "latter days" is provocative, and i doubt that the film was well received in provo or pocatello, even though the script is intelligent, sensitive, and insightful.
