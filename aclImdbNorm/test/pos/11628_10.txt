i have seen this show when i was younger. it is a really good show to watch. it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old. barney is definitely super de duper. b.j. is pretty funny. babie bop is very cute. the kids are very cool too. this show is about learning about numbers kinda like sesame street but different type of show and characters like barney the purple dinosaur, b.j. the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head, and baby bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. the first one that started was very old barney and friends show. but then the second one was different to be new episodes. also the last one in the 2000 was new scene of barney's park. they also have a show of barney at universal studios in florida where you see barney, b.j., and baby bop and then when the show is done you get to go play, shop and meet barney. it's a very good show watch this show when you learn about many things you will like it the movie, and the live show at universal studios florida.
