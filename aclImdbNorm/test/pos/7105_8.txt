the last of the sequels,not counting abbott and costello meet frankenstein which was more or less a spoof.this time count dracula (john carridine)takes center stage seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kindly doc(onslow stevens).well good ole larry talbot(lon chaney jr)shows up also seeking a cure.the good doc succeeds in curing larry's werewolfism,but dracula tricks the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doc a crazed lunatic.oh and all this time big franky(glenn strange)lies on a table awaiting his electricity fix so he can wreak some havoc.this was kind of a short movie,around 70 minutes and some change,but the action is there,and the great actors are there as well.lionel atwill turns up as a police inspector,heres some trivia,lionel atwill appeared in son of frankenstein,ghost of frankenstein,frankenstein meets the wolf-man,and house of frankenstein. and then this one.if there was another in the series they may have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line up,i'm giving house of dracula 8 out of 10.
