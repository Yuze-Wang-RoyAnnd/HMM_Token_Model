all i can say is that, i was expecting a wick movie and "blurred" surprised me on the positive way. very nice teenager movie. all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movies, because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years, when we were young. as well, lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children, because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time.try this movie and you will be very pleased.at the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted.
