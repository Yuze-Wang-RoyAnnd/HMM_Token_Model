carla gugino literally melts the screen in this crime caper. her sex appeal, ample assets and sexy southern accent more than make this film rewatchable. but the film has so many "other" things to make it almost a modern classic. simon baker's performance for one thing. truly that of a great actor. til schweiger is so perfectly cast it makes me wonder why he's not a huge "crossover" star. gil bellows rounds out this motely crew and literally steals this show. other gugino's cleavage easily the best performance in the movie. emma thompson and alan rickman are so utterly brilliant...i cannot even describe it. great chemistry.<br /><br />the music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in and of itself. wonderous to behold.<br /><br />people may say it's tarantino influenced...i disagree. it's clearly unique and clever in it's own right. sebastian gutierrez does a wonderful job at directing this tightly woven film and underplaying a lot of scenes that left me reeling. the ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. all in all a lovely film that, to me, is the very definition of what a good movie should be.
