there are other movies about boarding schools and the antics of the students and staff, but "the belles of st. trinian's" towers above them all! the plot has been thoroughly summarized by other posters, so i won't cover the same ground. i just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally out on dvd, but in a format that can't be used in the u.s.! :-( <br /><br />enjoy, fellow fans in new zealand and australia! and if anyone reading this has any pull in such matters, please help get it released on dvd with region 1 encoding! also, is it possible to be notified via e-mail when (i won't say "if") it is released on dvd in the united states? thanks!
