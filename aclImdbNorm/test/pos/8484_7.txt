ray is interesting in parts, and technically it's very well made, but ray is often sluggish, and forgets some important details about ray's life. all the movie shows us is parts where he's in his prime, and most successful, which is good, it's just i wanted to see some bits about his older life too. jamie fox mimics ray charles to a t, at times it's absolutely uncanny. i have to say, jamie is the reason i got through this movie. the 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd. it's more interesting, it has more oomph, and it's nowhere near as sluggish as the 2nd. i wasn't a big fan of ray charles to begin with to be honest, so i really didn't have any expectations for the film, what so ever. ray's biggest problem had to be the over length. this could've been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, other then the ones they used. i found the early part of ray's life when he was just starting to get successful, the most interesting. he was humble back then, and somewhat a gentleman. and while the film may have over exaggerated his actions, he got a bit too full of himself for me to care.<br /><br />performance. jamie fox gives a performance for the ages as ray. he looks like ray, talks like ray, acts like ray. he even sings like ray!. this is much more then an impression, i truly believed he was, ray charles. he was the heart of the film, and without his presence, this film would've been a complete and utter bore.<br /><br />bottom line. ray is interesting at times, dreadfully dull at others. when all was said and done, i was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times. just because it's a bibliographical film, doesen't mean it's automatically oscar worthy. jamie fox deserved his oscar, but the movie is above average at best. worth a watch, but if i were you, i'd keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level.<br /><br />7/10
