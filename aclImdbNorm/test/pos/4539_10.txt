this is one of my most favorite movies of all time. pretty pathetic you say? well, yeah it is. but chris is incredibly, incredibly funny. his innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films. look at both motel scenes, when spade gets caught with his zipper down, and the other: "just go away for the love of god!!!"
