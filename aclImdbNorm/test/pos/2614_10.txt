this was it! i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff.<br /><br />the one thing that i hated was that why was shannon kicked off and not alyssa. i hate her i would rather her character die that shannon's. what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and prue was crying by her side i started crying too lol. at the time that this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore! lol<br /><br />then the whole go back in time thing was a shocker and really good. i also blame pheobe for prue's death because instead of being with her sisters she had to be a slutty bi*** and be with her good for nothing demon boyfriend.<br /><br />but i think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a chrmed classic.<br /><br />forever charmed! blessed be!
