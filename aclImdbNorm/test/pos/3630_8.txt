the duke is a very silly film--a dog becoming a duke! but it's a very fun movie. it has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have, but (thankfully!) no bodily function jokes, as so many animal movies feel compelled to have! mostly, it's just dogs being dogs and people being. . . well, people. the 'good guys' are likeable and appealing. the 'bad guys' are ridiculous, and of course, the pun of many jokes. but there is something dignified about this movie, for even though it is silly, it's not out for every cheap laugh like "home alone" and others.<br /><br />crocket, simon and copper do an excellent job playing black and tan coonhound "hubert" who becomes the duke after his beloved owner, a real duke, dies. for the most part, they just act like dogs, no 'talking,' or human-like emotions and attitudes. however, they do stereotype poodles, and hubert does fall for her, just because she's a poodle. come on! these are dogs--they have a different view of beauty!!!<br /><br />overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.
