along with in the army!, this ranks as one of pauly shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. while the whole west coast-meets- midwest-culture-clash isn't anything new, this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore. while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was rather entertaining. not only was shore's interaction with the family hilarious, it also had carla gugino and tiffani- amber theissen (she'll always have the amber in my book) in two ravishing and early roles. one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv.
