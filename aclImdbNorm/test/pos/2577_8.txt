(my synopsis) rae (christina ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with ronnie (justin timberlake) to fulfill her needs. ronnie must report to his national guard unit and leaves rae all alone. rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. after a party, rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. the next day, lazarus (samuel l. jackson) finds rae and carries her home. lazarus gives medical care to rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. rae is like a dog in heat so lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just left him for another man. lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain.<br /><br />(my comment) the movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence. the film has a different feel to it. the story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. the 40 pound chain is a good metaphor, and symbolic of a chastity belt. you don't give love away to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. the chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, yet rae didn't cook. rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not. i think craig brewer (writer & director) has made an extraordinary movie, and samuel l. jackson sings a mean blues song. the story is emotionally charged, tackling the subjects of race, religion, music, and sex all into one. (paramount classics, run time 1:56, rated r)(8/10)
