this is a well-crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense. as usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the film's time). i did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another.<br /><br />the only thing i did not like about this movie was the choice of farley granger for the part of guy haines. somehow, i didn't find him very believable. on the other hand, robert walker shines as sinister 'bad guy' bruno anthony.<br /><br />overall, i would highly recommend this.
