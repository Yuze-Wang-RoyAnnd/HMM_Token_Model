gary busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. it's always good to see that fine actor, don stroud (one of the crickets) and charlie martin smith as well.<br /><br />an 8 out of 10. best performance = gary busey. thankfully, mr. busey was oscar-nominated for this, losing to jon voight in coming home. a fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with great songs by mr. holly. i hope this made plenty of dough. busey was never this popular again for varying reasons, but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume.
