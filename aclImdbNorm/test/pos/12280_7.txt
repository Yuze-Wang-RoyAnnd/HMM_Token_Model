the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good. it's grainy and has almost no color in some parts. it switches back and forth between english and french, often in mid sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! to make matters much worse, there are no english subtitles during the french language parts, which i think make up at least one quarter of the film. but, amazingly, the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this condition, and i think that says a lot about how well-made this film is.<br /><br />this is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting, an interesting storyline, and an excellent music score. it also has a cool protagonist, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some strange characters and events, and an overall feeling of melancholy. this film has "euro" written all over it.<br /><br />i hope there is a pristine negative or print of this film out there somewhere, because it deserves a quality dvd release, and when it comes out i will be one of the first in line to get it!
