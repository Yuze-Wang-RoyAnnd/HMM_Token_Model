despite looking dated, "inki and the minah bird" is, my opinion, an enjoyable and charming cartoon. the artwork isn't extraordinary, but good enough. this cartoon has no dialogs, just sounds and music, but this combination works out pretty well. the cartoon itself is good, funny, old fashioned, creative, entertaining and amusing.<br /><br />this cartoon also makes the difference because it focus in just 3 characters: inki (the little black girl), the minah bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion that wants to have both inki and minah for breakfast - so he chases them both during most of the cartoon.<br /><br />i actually find that lion very handsome, hilarious and cool. i really like that lion. that poor lion is so silly and loser that you have to feel sorry for him. for me, the real enemy is the minah bird, not the lion. at one point, the lion almost eats it - too bad he doesn't get to gulp it, because it deserved to be eaten.<br /><br />back to this animated short, there isn't a single dull or boring moment. at least for me. the only bit that i find stupid is the ending because the bird has a major fight with the lion, steals his teeth and puts them on itself. other than that, i have nothing major to criticize about this, aside the fact that the steak should've definitely have gone for the lion and not the bird.<br /><br />in my opinion, this is a very forgotten and underrated little jewel that should definitely get more credit.
