recap: based on the true story of charlie wilson, an american congressman, who (according to this movie) was instrumental in usa's covert war in afghanistan against the soviet union.<br /><br />comments: a rather funny movie about not so funny things, especially since they were real. but focusing on the movie, hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan. hanks, and the entire movie, philip seymor hoffman especially, has a rather humorous tone. so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. but, the story that it tell, and maybe the ending the most, are serious indeed.<br /><br />a story of what happened with some questions about what might have been. so the movie works as a comedy if you want one, and a much more serious one if you want that. something for everybody? 7/10
