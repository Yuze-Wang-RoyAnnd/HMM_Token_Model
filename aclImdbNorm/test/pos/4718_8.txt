it was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored asian country like myanmar had to be made and beyond rangoon is hollywood's answer. initially i thought hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally hollywood spice of titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful.<br /><br />anyway, the film was honest-to-god and i was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. apart from the fact that filming was done outside of myanmar in malaysia & thailand and that i missed the exotic burmese locales, i could not find much fault in the film.<br /><br />you cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. it is after all, real events of a civil war. the music by hans zimmer is definitely the usp of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it.<br /><br />i was only a year old in rangoon (now yangon) during this tumultuous time. when i heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which i was too young to absorb, i had to get the dvd and needless to say, i could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.
