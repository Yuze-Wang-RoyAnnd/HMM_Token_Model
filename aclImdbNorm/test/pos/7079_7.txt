i loved this movie. to be very fair, the movie starts off very slowly, with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic. it continues in this way for a good half of the film.<br /><br />but, if you're patient, you'll be greatly rewarded. what the first half of the movie lacks in character development and/or sympathy is adequately compensated for in the second half. it's a bit like riding a roller coaster - a slow, uphill climb to strat off with, and then speed, twists and turns, and a few surprises.<br /><br />as usual, meryl streep is wonderful. she is the finest actress of our time. william hurt is good, if a bit wooden in spots. renee zellweger does a very good job, showing that her performance in jerry mcguire wasn't a fluke.
