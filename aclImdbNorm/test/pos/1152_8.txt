now, lissen you guys, i loved this film, though not quite as much as farewell to the king, another beloved john milius epic. it was fun, a lot more than if it were based on a tennessee williams drama. it's a great yarn, with a whiff of political correctness. i love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the bad guys (berbers) and the real bad guys, the spear- carriers for the acquisitive 'civilized' world, with their repeating rifles, artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor. <br /><br />the standout scene is the berber encampment with blue-gray smoke from the cooking fires rising into the chill desert air. it is visually eloquent, highly evocative.<br /><br />set in 1904 morocco, wind features a helpless american woman (candace bergen) who is taken hostage by a dashing, albeit immodest, berber bandit (sean connery-the very model ofa scottish muslim nomad). the exciting story is based on a few historical facts. the photography is milius beautiful, punctuated by jerry goldsmith's outstanding score.<br /><br />mrs pedicaris and the raisuli conduct protracted foreplay and bounce around in the desert between oases. even though the raisuli proudly traces his lineage back to the apes, he is a perfect gentleman - he even lets her keep her head after she beats him at chess! a marine detachment storms the bashaw's palace, putting out the fires of competing hegemonies with gasoline. don't mess with the corps, abdul. <br /><br />there are many entertaining stereotypes:<br /><br />despicable sultan - resembles a dissipated ferret. definitely not a liberal.<br /><br />cruel german officer - a large, bellicose dachshund sporting a monocle. he gallantly chooses to fight the raisuli with swords instead of gunning him down in the manner of indiana jones. noblesse oblige, by way of von clausewitz?<br /><br />dashing marine officer - kicks the crap out of the bashaw of tangier's army and storms his palace while chewing tobacco. his speech is mildly aphasic. the bashaw begged him not to breathe on him.<br /><br />the berbers - a horde of groveling sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac. none of them take baths, except perhaps in camel urine.<br /><br />president teddy roosevelt is undeservedly portrayed as vacuous and preoccupied with guns, toys and stuffed grizzly bears.<br /><br />beautiful american widow - gives the men a lesson in courage, as do her two children. she evidently has a huge supply of clean, starched clothes and rarely has a hair out of place. <br /><br />the raisuli sends teddy roosevelt a message, thanking him for the gift of a remington repeating rifle, declaring,<br /><br />"meester roosevelt, you are the lion and aiee am the breaking wind."<br /><br />how true.<br /><br />please do not take my acerbic remarks to mean that i did not like the film. i had almost as much fun writing this as watching da pitcher.
