i love this movie. <br /><br />yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called "big fat liar". even though this kid runs away to hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. <br /><br />i don't think it was just one big ad for universal studios, because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is. <br /><br />it has good music and fun characters. this family/comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike. it has humour, excitement, and real life difficulties like lying.<br /><br />in the end, "big fat liar" sends out a moral: don't expect lying to be easy.
