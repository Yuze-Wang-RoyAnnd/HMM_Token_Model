i first saw it at 5am january 1, 2009, and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again. love everything (well, almost, so 9 stars) about it. no color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, anna, camera work, music. well, sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops. but this is not a musical after all. i like anna's acting, this naive wannabe gangster girl, how she speaks, holds the gun, everything makes me smile. no, it's not that funny, though i have laughed a bit at some moments, it's just so subtle. excellent work by samuel benchetrit. though 3d nouvelle seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, cause they are stealing ideas. and the last scene is my favorite. makes me feel so warm and.. romantic. yes, i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such art-housish movies. and i don't agree with those comparing it to pulp fiction. it's not about action and twisted story, though all vignettes intersect. it's calm, and maybe too slow movie for most of the people. it's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. anyway, probably this review won't be of much help to anyone (my first), just wanted to express my appreciation.<br /><br />spoiler: this movie doesn't have a goofs section. wonder, didn't anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the kidnappers decided to go home? looks like a part of crew, hehe. i know i should better post this in forums, but i don't agree with some policies here.
