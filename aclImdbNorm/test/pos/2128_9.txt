this movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. my nieces have watched it non-stop since they've gotten it, and as a result i've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. i can't get enough of it. the cgi images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices. just keep in mind that it is a barbie movie, and, though cheesy at times, in my experience, this one lives up to the high standard which the other barbie princess movies have set for it. i would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess. it teaches a good lesson as well. everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.
