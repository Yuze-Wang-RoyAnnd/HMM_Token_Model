i still can't believe that computer graphics are able to create 3d images. the moment i heard it from my friends over at a forum, i swear to myself that i am going to make myself watch it.<br /><br />i managed to watch parts of it at a fellow shopping centre where they had many advent children dvds and showed it at a few laptops for sale. obviously i was overjoyed but it was still not enough. then i headed off to youtube.com to search for the movie. all i came up with was music video dedications. until that fateful day...i found it. i watched it despite all the distractions because i knew that i have to watch or else i will be called a loser.<br /><br />enough about me more on the movie. as if final fantasy vii wasn't enough, they made a movie about it! my most favourite part was the end of sephiroth's life. cloud's omnislash couldn't be better. but i wouldn't entirely spoil the show for you. you have to watch it for yourself!!! get the dvd now!
