mel brooks is a great writer,director and actor, but once in a while even he can have a klinker. the beginning of this starts out almost basically just meeting one character after another.you have cary elwes who's charming and talented, but he can't do comedy. his expressions into the camera show that even he can't believe the inanities in the script. richard lewis looks bored and distracted throughout without much to do and amy yasbeck is stuck in high-school acting mode. dave chapelle shows great comedy range mugging and hamming for the camera and mark blankfield is mostly stifled in the role of the blind man, but then he does still manage to show great comedy range. eric allen kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he does have are binding. the best roles are those of roger rees, tracy ullman, megan cavanaugh and brooks for when he does appear. dom deluise has a funny turn as a mafia don employing a clint eastwood lookalike, but on the minus side, some of the jokes aren't very funny while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from mel's other movies.
