i watched this movie thinking it was going to be absolutely horrible and was ready for all the corniness, bad special effects, etc. but, i was pleasantly surprised. not to say that it's the best vampire movie i have ever seen, but it certainly isn't the worst. i liked the whole alternate reality/dream state that played into the movie. the graphics were quite well for a straight to dvd movie and i liked the overall look of the film. i enjoyed the main character sai. i usually end up hating the female leads but there was something about her that kept me interested. yes, she does make some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. yes, the other characters were stereotypical, but i was expecting that too. i don't know if i'd highly recommend this movie, but give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised. i'm putting this one on my guilty pleasures list.
