i remember seeing the trailer for this film and i absolutely knew i had to see this movie. it looked like something that would be right up my alley.<br /><br />"the united states of leland" is a terrific movie. it is not one that will leave you with a nice, pleasant ending, but with a sad, empty feeling instead. and when i say it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, i do not mean that as a bad thing. i believe that you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and human's general motives and how they act as parts of society.<br /><br />ryan gosling is perfectly cast as leland. he is intelligent, yet stoic. i like the way that he narrates the film with his journal. the supporting cast is terrific as well. kevin spacey is very good, as always, and don cheadle is amazing as leland's teacher and mentor. <br /><br />this was a great story and is very smart and thought provoking. i highly recommend it.
