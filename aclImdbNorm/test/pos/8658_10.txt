synopsis: andreas (trond fausa aurvaag) finds himself alone on a coach, getting dropped off on a desert land, at what seems the last stop of his journey. he doesn't know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him. after momentarily pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. he then enters a world different to the one he came from. <br /><br />as andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking. as he takes his first lunch break, he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits. on this same day, he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes, of what looks like an act of suicide. the strange thing is, the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened. it is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised, and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent. <br /><br />to help andreas settle in, he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub. the club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night..and as andreas drinks his sorrows aways, he realises that no matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. as he tells these observances to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on andreas' mind all along. realising that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house, and notes where he lives for future reference. the plot predictably evolves with andreas wanting an escape. he seeks out the man he once followed...hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again...but is it too late?<br /><br />my thoughts: this norwegian film is something which everyone should see, as it holds the answer to the big question! what is the meaning of life? (well, close enough). the film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today's working man (or woman). it's sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic. it tries to show that small clich'e things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, is the moment you're one step away from becoming a robot. the ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you've now become used to. you start to adopt the saying of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and become too comfortable to take a risk of change.<br /><br />even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism...its message is more than real. the lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and that of which andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. the director, jens lien has put together a film, which in any other director's hands would have failed. this is a fine piece of cinematic genius, and i eagerly await to see what he does next.<br /><br />the lead role, played by trond fausa aurvaag is perfectly cast. representing the average joe, trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous. the supporting actors also do an apt job, and for some reason, i feel that keanu reeves would have been perfect in this film, as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless.<br /><br />the score for this film was beautifully composed. the recurring theme was always a delight to listen to, and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie.<br /><br />set for a release date in the uk for 25th may 2007, i will definitely be going to re-live this experience on the big screen. this film has gained its way in my top 10...now quickly becoming my top 20! it has some shocking scenes, and is darkly humorous throughout...a must -see!!
