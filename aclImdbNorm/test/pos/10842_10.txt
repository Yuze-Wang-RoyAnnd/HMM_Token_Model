this is one of the best lesbian films i have ever seen! this series brought joy and sadness of true love. being set in the 1800's was an amazing look at lesbian lives and desires of lesbian women. the cast was beyond expectation! rachael stirling is an amazing actress, i have never seen her other works but her portrayal of nan made me connect with her feeling her heartache and pains and love. the one thing i feel most important is connecting with the characters in anything i watch. if anyone has doubts on seeing this film...think twice! this is a must see series. well done again to bbc! we need more lesbian films that portrays real love and hurts, like this one. living in canada i had this dvd imported and i am so thrilled to have purchased it.
