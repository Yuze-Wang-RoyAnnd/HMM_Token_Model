it's a sad state in corporate hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one. i had literally no idea how this film was going to end, because it went left when i expected it to go right, zigged when i expected a zag, etc. this could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller, or depressing white trash drama, but it stayed a course all its own till the end. it is a sad story, though. not because of what happens to alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path.<br /><br />the plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater, but the pacing could use some tightening up. either way, it's a very good film, and for some reason i suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low.
