i saw messiah 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it`s still compelling . much of my praise has to do with ken stott`s performance as dci red metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . it`d be easy for stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way . likewise the murders are very shocking but - unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out onscreen in a rather ott manner - there`s actually little violence shown .<br /><br />my only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant i wasn`t taken in by the shock twist ( and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i won`t bother with a spoiler alert ) and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story . if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe it`d be a good idea not to make messiah 3
