normally i try to avoid barbie films, but this one was unmistakably awesome. kudos to the graphics and character voice overs. it all flowed well. this enchanting tale is a great spin off of others, but is well worth buying! i don't have kids, but the kids i babysit, (including boys) find it intriguing and love the extra features on the dvd. i honestly don't know why this is rated so low, but for kids, especially your barbie lovin' 8 year old will love this. its not straight forward and predictive like most movies are. this "childrens" film has excellent morals and shows teamwork. it has no swearing, bits of romance (if your old enough to figure it out) and beautifully written storyline. thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten!
