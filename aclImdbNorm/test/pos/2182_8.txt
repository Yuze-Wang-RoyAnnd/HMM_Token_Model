i saw this last night on turner classic movies (tcm). i had never heard of it before, and was quite surprised to find it so engrossing.<br /><br />bogart does a star turn as a city-wise cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy radio-network boss in this incisive "b" programmer. about 12 years before he played similar city-wise cynics to perfection in movies like deadline usa, knock on any door, the barefoot contessa, and the harder they fall, bogie already had the star qualities down pat.<br /><br />in order to boost ratings, and bring their somewhat high-brow programming to a more popular level, wubc, "the voice of america", pushes a tell-all radio mini-series about a woman who was acquitted 20 years ago by a plea of self-defense of killing her husband. not willing to be discreet in order to save the woman's and her husband's reputations, the station uses underhanded methods to reveal all to all listeners, and as luridly as possible.<br /><br />as a time capsule, i also found it very illuminating of male-female mores in the workplace in the mid-1930's. although beyond henry o'neill, i'm unfamiliar with the supporting cast, the players were uniformly excellent, and the direction was taut.<br /><br />if you like this kind of movie at all (e.g., a face in the crowd, an inspector calls, etc.), don't miss the opportunity to see this one.<br /><br />
