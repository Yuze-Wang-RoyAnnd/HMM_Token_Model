in retrospect, the 1970s was a golden era for the american cinema, as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by ted demme and richard lagravenese. this ifc effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentary.<br /><br />the amazing body of work that remains, is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period. the decade was marked by the end of the viet nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of jimmy carter's presidency.<br /><br />one thing comes out clear, films today don't measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry, as a whole, has changed dramatically. the big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content, or integrity, as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenues.<br /><br />the other thing that emerges after hearing some of america's best creative minds speak, is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic rewards.<br /><br />this documentary is a must see for all movie fans.
