this is christmas time! a nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the italian cinema. it was something like 30-40 years that the italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. this is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. and finally this is also a big production for italian standards of the time. in this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. no rhetoric, no easy surreal shortcuts, no typical touristic tornatore-like picturing, no over acting, no director autoreferentialism. there is also a cool use of two heartbreaking nina simone's songs, whose music, i reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score. so if this will not be a real reviveing for the italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for emanuele crialese after his 'respiro' another definitive beautiful film. 'nuovomondo' is not to be missed, it is that kind of 'medicine film' helpful to enjoy movie-making, movie watching, helpful to enjoy and understand life. francesco cabras
