i was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later point, was a regular viewer. i remember that i really enjoyed the show, along with "leave it to beaver", "my three sons", "ozzie and harriet", "dick van dyke", reruns of "i love lucy", "the real mccoys", etc. i am now enjoying the first season of "donna reed" on dvd and have watched the first two episodes. donna stone is shown to be an intelligent, well-mannered, problem-solving, serene, stay-at-home mom, similar to june cleaver and in contrast to lucy ricardo. in episode 2, i especially like how ms. reed becomes a surrogate dad, trading in her dress for sweats and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to defend himself physically against a much larger bully. while none of the mothers in the neighborhood i grew up in, including my own, exactly met the idealistic standards portrayed by ms. reed, it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision-making prevail at the end of the day, in contrast to today's accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among one's neighbors. i cannot imagine jeff and mary stone being told by their parents that trespassing in their neighbors' yards is okay, leaving a dog outside to bark all day is acceptable, or telling their mother to "shut up" in a supermarket in front of everyone.
