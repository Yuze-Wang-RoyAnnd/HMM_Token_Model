this is, by far, the best movie i've seen in a long while. it is a wholly original and beautiful plot. it is not boring, nor is it too dramatic. the characters are tangible and realistic, but it does not take away from the story line. the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch. the end leaves you fulfilled in a way i've never experienced in a movie before. <br /><br />i wish i had found this movie earlier.<br /><br />more lines.<br /><br />more lines.<br /><br />more lines a lot more lines c'mon, i'm done
