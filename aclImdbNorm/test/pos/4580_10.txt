i stumbled upon this movie by accident. i mean, how else could i find out? it wasn't hyped at all by the studios, nor did i even hear about it's release from my normally plugged in friends. after throwing my money away on so many bad movies this year, i wish i could've seen this one in theaters as opposed to dvd. mike judge is the master of disguising deliciously intelligent humor in a low brow package. just watch "king of the hill" for a while...it's ostensibly redneck humor, but it's a very subtle jab at rednecks while being very sympathetic at the same time. i read the tagline for this film, and immediately i ordered it off the internet. i really don't understand where these negative reviews are coming from, except maybe from carl's jr. this movie is not only hilarious, but it's balanced as well. moments of levity are interspersed between hilarious sight gags and jabs at our current superstar/corporate culture. sure, there is some fart humor, but it's only there to laugh at derisively. the premise is only semi-plausible, but since when did that even matter? i don't see people heaping scorn upon "futurama" because the premise is very similar. just watch this movie. if you don't laugh, then something is really wrong with you. maybe your dad works for gatorade or something, and he was really offended by the movie. maybe you're an idiot. probably the latter.
