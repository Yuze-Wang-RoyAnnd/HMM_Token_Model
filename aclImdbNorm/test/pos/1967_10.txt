this is actually the first movie i ever saw in a theatre , where the people didn't leave immediately when the end credits started. in stead they remained seated for a few minutes , gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite , trying to understand what they 've just seen.<br /><br />the only thing i can say: try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible (so did i)!. i gave it a 10
