niagra niagra was certainly not the best movie i have seen. however., i cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how i felt as it ended and also how i feel about it now. very few movies have such an effect on me. i like them or i do not. i look at niagra niagra as a work of art. we all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc... this movie had me in not the best mood. in fact it left me feeling empty somehow. i guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways. they had no direction. their only direction was to have no direction. they had many problems to deal with and i guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life. but on the way things really only got worse. a steady decline from where it started. it was sad as it was so well acted and i guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in. they might have had a good life if they had any idea how. but it wes clear they did not know what to do. so they kind of rambled to someplace they had heard about. no real goal. they had no idea how to have a goal. they had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them. i felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that i would not like if just anyone played the parts. these two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting. i am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on dvd. you know. it left me feeling a little like leaving los vegas did. but again it is in a class of its own. not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day. if you are a person who has problems i would not suggest you watch it. it could depress you. it depressed me and i have not the conditions these folks had. jimmyjoejetter
