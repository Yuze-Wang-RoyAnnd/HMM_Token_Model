a sick man carleton hendricks (dee snider), cruises the teen chat lines as captain howdy. he poses as a teenage boy and invites other teens over his house to party. he instead knocks them out, strips them, sews their mouth closed and tortures them (mostly with needles). he captures the daughter of cop mike gage (kevin gage). he finds him, arrests him and he's institutionalized. four years later he's released...totally cured. but a lynch mop (led, amusingly, by robert englund) attack him and hang him. he doesn't die but he snaps and captain howdy is back...<br /><br />a very sick, disturbing, twisted horror film. captain howdy enjoys pain and torture and is trying to show the kids he kidnaps how to enjoy it also. the torture scenes aren't that explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you do see is very very sick. there's no humor and the (muted) screams of his victims sound way too real. i was cringing away from the tv during most of the scenes. <br /><br />the acting varies. kevin gage isn't that good as the cop--he's not terrible but he could have been better. dee snider is very scary as captain howdy--his attack scenes are not pleasant.<br /><br />all in all, not your typical horror film. i'll probably never see it again (this film really gets under your skin) but i recommend it to all horror fans--at least those with strong stomaches. i give it a 7.
