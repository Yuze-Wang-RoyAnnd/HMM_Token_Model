this film, with only two characters, takes you closer to these two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, than most films take you to any character, however well-crafted.<br /><br />the sheer confusion, terror and pain which madeleine stowe's character undergoes is deeply disturbing, as is alan rickman's sadistic yet charming interrogator.<br /><br />this film is all too possible, and builds to a shocking climax, the effect of the film as a whole leaving you sitting in silence at the end. it'll haunt you for a long time.
