ok. so it can be done! we have here the perfect vampire movie. gothic, beautiful. with all the ingredients. a realistic vampire. a wonderful story. take note - i am from transylvania and i assure you, this movie respects the vampire lore! it's exactly like the tales i heard in my childhood. for a transylvanian, it is quite... believable. you must see it, if you are interested by real vampires, as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent hollywood movies (as far as i can guess, the hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus - which is pretty hilarious for me. vampires are never good-looking or attractive, they can inspire only horror and repulsion. the incubus - called in my country the night flier, is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them.) i strongly recommend this for any gothic person out there! see also the sequels, they are all 4 very good! and of course, don't miss dark shadows! something similar is nosferatu in venice with klaus kinski. i recommend that one to.
