nothing is worse than the genocides of our world's history. this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family - a common narrative device - in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima. the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war. the story, however, becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives; in other words, if you don't really care about them, the film grows boring. it's hard not to care, though, when a family's homeland is wrecked. i'm not sure if i would recommend this film, because it says very little politically and, honestly, did not keep my interest in the family's troubles.
