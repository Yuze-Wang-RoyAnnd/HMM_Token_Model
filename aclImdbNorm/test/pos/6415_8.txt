*minor spoilers*<br /><br />need any further proof that tsai ming-liang ranks among the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today? see this film.<br /><br />working from slight variations of a theme running through most of his work, the hole represents a study in alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and woman who are upstairs/downstairs neighbors - and how varied structures (real or psychological) of modernity wall people off from one another. here, the woman (the downstairs neighbor) attempts to endure as her apartment is flooded by a prodigious leak from upstairs. a plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. already isolated and desperate (both characters are among the few residents of a housing project who haven't fled in advance of a mysterious, near-apocalyptic epidemic). the hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities, but soon begins to take on a significance of near-mythic proportions.<br /><br />tsai's sense of humor, and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a bit more overtness than usual - as the woman's occasional daydreams revolving around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers (set to the music of grace chang) which explode from the screen in brief bits of sensualistic, surreal romance and humor - quite reminiscent of the big-screen pennies from heaven. and for all of the ennui and alienation on display here, tsai's skewering of late 90s pre-millennial tensions is funny, absurd, and gives this film a very appealing strageness. the final scene is extraordinary.<br /><br />meanwhile tsai - in typical fashion - subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions westerners bring to asian cinema with a nonchalant, casually-revealed directness, focusing on both the absurdist tendencies of the human mind, and the most absolute of mundanities. there's an utter, nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters, sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers (which does amplify the isolation of the characters), making the hole - and his other films - rather disorienting, but also always fascinating and insightful.
