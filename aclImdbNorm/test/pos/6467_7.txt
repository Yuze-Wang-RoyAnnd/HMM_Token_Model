"edge of the city" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to "on the waterfront". from it's nyc locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs.<br /><br />"edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. in my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like "waterfront". at 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.<br /><br />possible spoilers****<br /><br />the relationship between sidney poitier and john cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. i don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /><br />i think that the whole love sub-plot with cassavettes could have been eliminated. he is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. the only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. there are other ways that they could have shown this. i would have also liked to see some scenes of axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.<br /><br />the acting is excellent. poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. his role as tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. cassavettes, as axel north, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. warden is terrific as the boss who knows axel's secret (although his fight scene with cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. too many break-away boxes). i thought ruby dee was wonderful in role of poitier's wife.<br /><br />on the whole, "edge of the city" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.<br /><br />7 out of 10
