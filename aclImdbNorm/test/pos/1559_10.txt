i wasn't expecting a whole lot when i rented this film, as a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days (well, hollywood films too for that matter) but this movie was fantastic, really great, it's too bad it didn't reach a huge audience because it's just superb. i really love alice's determination, it really makes me look upon my life as a gift, and i see how privileged i am just to have an education. but all of that aside, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, no matter what the budget, it's an excellent film and everyone should watch it, they will love it and definitely learn something from it. i don't have to be roger ebert to know it's one of the best movies i've seen all year, and certainly one of the most truthful.
