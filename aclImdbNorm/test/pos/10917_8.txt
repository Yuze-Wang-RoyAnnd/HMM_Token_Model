i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud. it's skillfully written, kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at bob newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than i.<br /><br />for that matter, i think the scenes where tom selleck kisses kevin kline, where kevin kline listens to the "how to be a man" cassette, and the post-(almost-)wedding scenes w/ joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie.<br /><br />sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but...few movies are perfect.
