this is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the civil war. this film is a must see for eastwood fans and eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films that he did. i couldn't agree more. watch out! this is a spoiler- eastwood does die in the end. eastwood and director don siegel rightfully argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for a few reasons. they wanted to stick to the book, for one. secondly, there can't always be a happy ending. thirdly, this was written during the vietnam war- they wanted a negative statement to this terrible struggle of war where people were needlessly dying. i agree with all of this. it is a wonderfully shot film and i love most films involving the civil war. it is more of a portrait of how deceptive women can be- that they can be more dangerous than men, hence the title has much to do with the statement of the film beguiled- to be deceived. the song sung by eastwood at the beginning and the end of the film is another statement against not just the civil war but the vietnam war and maybe indirectly the women he comes across during the film. wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes- note: this film is rated r for no reason. there is hardly any language, it is probably some of the subject matter involving sex- but there is no nudity really. excellent film- 9/10.
