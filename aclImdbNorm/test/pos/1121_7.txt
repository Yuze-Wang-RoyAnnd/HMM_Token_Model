another of the endless amount of cookie-cutter 'kickboxers fight to the death for the amusement of wealthy scumbags' films that there were so many of in the 90s... y'know, the ones created by taking the words 'death', 'blood' and 'steel' and the words 'ring', 'fight', 'match' and 'cage' and putting them in a random generator! saying that though, death match is a pretty good entry in the over-used genre, thanks to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its kickboxer cast.<br /><br />the story concerns two buddies - ex-kickboxing world champion john larson (played by pug-faced middleweight kickboxing champ ian jacklin, probably previously best known for his awful performance as the main villain in ring of fire 2) and nick wallace (nick hill, a likable guy probably best known for the role of street-fighter sergio in bloodsport 2) who work the l.a. docks loading crates onto ships. one discovery of a boxful of guns and a brief fight later, our two heroes are jobless and propping up an l.a. bar. sensible john larson decides to head north and look for a job; headstrong nick wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "why should things change?" says john, " if you need me, i'll be there." predictably enough, it isn't long before nick has gone missing and his good friend is fighting in the deadly 'ring of death' trying to find a lead to his missing buddy.<br /><br />sure enough, there are no prizes for originality here, but like i said before, this films strength lies in its action, its cast of real-life fighters and the fairly good performances it manages to wring from them. ian jacklin in particular surprised me. previously i'd just seen him as the bad guy in ring of fire 2 and in bit-parts in tripe like the steel ring, and i've always been quite amused at how bad an actor he is (good fighter though!). but in death match, he's pretty good! given a decent script and a haircut, he proves himself to be quite the charismatic leading man! and his friendship with nick is very well portrayed. jacklin and hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters care for each other. enough for one of them to lose a job, travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other - i wish i had a friend like that! <br /><br />it was also nice to see matthias hues as a villainous henchman with a little more depth than we're used to seeing from his many 'villainous henchman' roles. however don't be fooled into thinking he's the star just because he's on the video cover (with, it seems, his head stuck on the body of michael bernardo from the cover of shootfighter) - he is good while he's on screen, but he isn't on much..<br /><br />on the negative side, the film is pretty slow when there's no fighting going on, with lots of unnecessary scenes (whats with gangster jimmie fiorello's pointless story about his grandfather??), and the end fight is disappointingly short, but on the whole i enjoyed it! plenty of fights, most of them good. isn't that all we martial arts really need? and of course eye-candy, here in the lovely form of the very pretty renee ammann. all in all, a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie.
