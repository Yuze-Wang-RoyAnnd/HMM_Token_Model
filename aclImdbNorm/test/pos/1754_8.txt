what i liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. it's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. you feel like you've stepped back into time.<br /><br />from reading some of the reviews here, i see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the pearl harbor attack. wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, i'm sure. too bad, because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then, almost 70 years ago. the colors are nice, drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by "hoppity" and and his beautiful girl "honey" to make it happily-ever-after and out of harm's way. it's also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling them.<br /><br />there is a nasty villain, though - "c. bagley beetle" - and two of his henchmen. those helpers ("swat, the fly" and "smack, the mosquito") are comedians, complete with their brooklyn-ese accents! the story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand. the good guy, meanwhile, has the decked stacked against him but in the very end, of course, prevails.<br /><br />my favorite part - this will sound worse than what it was - was when good-guy "hoppity" got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in black-and-white. that was fantastic animation! <br /><br />you know, it's a good thing i didn't see this as a very little kid; i would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bug-people! you never know what (or who) is in that grass beneath your feet!
