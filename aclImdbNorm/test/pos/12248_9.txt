i didn't like "as good as it gets" very much, but i am a big fan of william hurt and holly hunter's work, so i decided to watch this movie. and the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of albert brooks. here, in spain, he's little-known, and only as a 2nd division version of woody allen in the west coast. he played a great part, but hunter and hurt were good too, specially hurt, in an relatively unusual role for him. hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in "once around" (lasse hallstrom, 1991).<br /><br />finally, the rest of the cast is great, too. robert prosky, one of these familiar faces of the american cinema, the ex-bond girl lois chiles, pretty good placed on that role, i think, the always perfect joan cusack in her early years; and specially the brief appereance of jack nicholson. maybe he doesn't have any good scene, but it's jack nicholson, anyway... the best movie by james l.brooks, great story (well resolved), and superb cast for one of the, surely, best movies of the 80's
