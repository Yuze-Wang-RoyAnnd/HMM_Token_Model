i don't understand why everyone hates this movie, aside from the fact that they're just jealous their music careers never took off like mega popstar aaron carter. like it or not aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having, so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie. lou pearlman and company have been known for over-exploiting their pop prot'eg'ees, you remember justin timberlake's foray into tv movie model behavior? granted this movie isn't big scale and impressive, but it's not supposed to be. it's not trying to impress people or be an emmy award winner, it was released straight to dvd. it's just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite popstar; i know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer, don't deny it. it's sweet and gentle and i applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex, violence, and vulgar language that seem to be creeping into more and more of our movies today. where's the decency? where's the line? teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies, at least this one is more tolerable to me than bratz (aka slutz) with all the fake little girls running around going "oh mah gawd!" in tank tops and mini skirts and is fathoms better than those gore fest movies like saw. i feel for the main character girl because i was nerdy outcast girl in high school who loved aaron carter and nsync and the backstreet boys and other pop music and still do; and like aaron's character would get crushing "testophobia", especially in math. if you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you don't like or are jealous of aaron carter and his fame, then of course you're going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews. the only reason britney spears' dribble crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs. accept this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be. i think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.
