as a father of four in his forties i thought this film made compelling viewing - if not edge-of-the-seat stuff. i deserves a far higher rating than the 4.3 that it had when i wrote this. (i gave it 7.)<br /><br />i agree with some of the comments about the characters but cameron diaz was, again, sparkling in yet another very different role. the plot was a little silly but the point of the film for me was beautifully summed up in the final, quite surreal, sequence. a moving ending for any parent.<br /><br />i could imagine that a young, single bloke might find the film quite boring but for other people not fixed on high doses of testosterone would find something sweet in this.
