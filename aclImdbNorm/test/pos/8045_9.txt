this movie really proves that the world is all too often an unfair place, especially the world of motion pictures. "the assignment" received barely any attention upon it's release and not surprisingly flopped at the box-office, but when history will be written this movie will most surely receive some long lost praise.<br /><br />thank god i'm surrounded by friends who knows what's good for me. being a movie buff like myself a pal highly recommended "the assignment", a movie i hadn't even heard about. i decided to check out what leonard maltin gave it, and not surprisingly he gave it **1/2. knowing that this is the same grade he gave classics like "alien", "the usual suspects" and "the matrix" (i kid you not) i knew his meaning didn't mean diddly squat jack s***. so without hesitating i went out and bought it on dvd. this was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my proudest belongings in my dvd collection, despite a cover design that echoes a low budget stinker with casper van dien.<br /><br />"the assignment" is expertly directed, delivering some really intense moments that will hold you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie, on top of that it boasts an at times brilliant story that you know will be riddled with unexpected twists and turns. it stars aidan quinn in one of his best performances, and serves him with great support by donald sutherland and ben kingsley who are both in great form.<br /><br />something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie, most of them can't seem to praise it enough. so what are you waiting for? if you call yourself a fan of action-thrillers you should have bought it, rented it, seen it yesterday!
