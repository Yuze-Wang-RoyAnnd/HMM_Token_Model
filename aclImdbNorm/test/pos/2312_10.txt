i've lost count of the times i have seen this movie, but i love it and find it very funny each time i see it. the facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great. the characters, especially "nitro", "sonar" and "stepanik" are hilarious. i thought kelsey grammar, rip torn and bruce dern did a great job. in fact, i think this movie was perfectly cast. i think it does need to be released in dvd before i wear my vhs version out.
