malcolm mcdowell diagnoses megan gallagher's daughter and she as having a form of illness, when they believe they are seeing "the huldre", troll-like creatures which live with "the rocks and the roots" (to quote the movie).<br /><br />basically a family moves into an older house, which has a smaller doll-house in the backyard. the daughter (well played by sofia vassiliova) starts to befriend the creatures, until they become vindictive. the family cat also disappears.<br /><br />there are a few good scenes with megan gallagher ("millennium") and malcolm mcdowell as the psychiatrist. there is also something strange which occurred to one of mcdowell's patients.<br /><br />if you enjoy this type of story, you may also like "bad ronald", which had a similar odd theme, and the house is haunted by bad ronald (scott jacoby) only that movie is from the 70's. 7/10.
