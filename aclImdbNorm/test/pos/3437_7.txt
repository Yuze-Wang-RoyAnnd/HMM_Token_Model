"jaded" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like "indecent behavior" or "friend of the family". <br /><br />"jaded" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. from the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. <br /><br />the raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. i think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie. that's why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end.<br /><br />the performances are extremely good from all the five female characters. these women gave strong, intense, but believable performances that demonstrate the actresses' dramatic abilities. <br /><br />the legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot's difficulty because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple raping. from the point of view of meg's defense, sodomy needs to be penalized as a raping (a huge crime grade b) although it's a different crime. pat and alex's defense claims that meg enjoyed and asked for it. this is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. the only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. <br /><br />watch "jaded" if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your society. if not, give it a try because it's a very good and strong drama.
