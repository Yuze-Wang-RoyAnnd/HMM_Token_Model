i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this. after seeing yimou zhang's 'hero', i decided to check his other movies, perhaps looking for something similar. the second yimou zhang's movie i watched was 'no one less' after which i realized what kind of cinema i'm now in. no wonder why i got 'keep cool' immediately. it is a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, i pay my respect to the director.<br /><br />this movie shows that it's not the amount of money makes film good. it's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this. the story is very simple, a typical extract of a typical daily life, moreover shown in a very simple way, the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie. i give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other yimou zhang's films.
