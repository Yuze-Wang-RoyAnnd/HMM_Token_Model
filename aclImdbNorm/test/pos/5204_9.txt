i just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. i got what i had expected and so much more. just to think i came across this movie by luck, before i had never even heard of it. it's a german film made in 1993 so i suppose i can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern american audience. it's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film, i dare say that its as good if not better then platoon, full metal jacket, apocalypse now, and all quiet on the western front; all of which are iconic war movies.<br /><br />1942: world war ii is in full swing. nazi germany has over run mainland europe and parts of north africa, then adolf hitler orders the full scale invasion of the soviet union. a fateful move that ultimately dooms nazi germany to defeat. in the early stages the invasion goes well and the german armies conquer large sections of soviet territory, but a critical battle ensues at stalingrad, a city that hold great symbolic & strategic value. the battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both the german & russian soldiers fighting. on the verge of taking the city the germans are suddenly counter attacked by the russians who end up cutting off the entire german 6th army inside stalingrad. to make matters worse, the russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the germans. this entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young german soldiers fighting for survival not only against the russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own sadistic officers who care only about medals & glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier.<br /><br />this film is going to haunt me for a while. the german soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive, then their humanity & sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic nazi's often portrayed in film. everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed in was shattered, and after fighting a gruesome battle against the russians inside stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of winter causing many to freeze to death. the battle & winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. it's amazing, in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life, and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything. after witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on, it was really sad. when there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another one of hitler's crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the russians. <br /><br />a good anti-war film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. the battle for the tractor factory sequence is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that's really what the battle for stalingrad was like. the german & russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only the bad apples (specifically on the german side) that doomed the men. bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically & emotionally during war. we all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. what the average foot soldier endured at stalingrad was beyond imagination. even if they had survived everything they had seen & done would have scarred them for life.<br /><br />stalingrad shows us why war is hell, and what exactly hell looks like.
