at the first glance of this film the camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button. surprisingly, the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that i feel most would relate to. i scored this movie at 7 but like most would, felt it should be a 10, you will understand as you watch it because its a rare thing for a film to be in touch with a persons feelings and how life should be shown by a tv set. most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects, twists and turns etc, this film dealt a true hand showed a good film backed by an alabama style storyline that most would feel was a good waste of a couple of hours. wish i had put the popcorn maker on after all well done!
