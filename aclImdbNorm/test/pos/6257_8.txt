*minor spoiler* <br /><br />inhabited isn't scary, but it is creepy. it is an interesting 'little' story with good acting and great special effects makeup.<br /><br />basic plot: a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family's new house and accompanying playhouse on her faerie friends.<br /><br />the movie doesn't waste time getting moving, though the ending could have been more involved.<br /><br />i don't recommend this movie to those expecting/wanting hardcore horror, but i do recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller.
