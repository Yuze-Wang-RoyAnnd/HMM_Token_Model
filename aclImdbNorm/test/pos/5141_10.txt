i took my younger niece to an early showing and she loved it (i enjoyed it myself as well). i don't need to explain the plot, since the movie remains completely true to the award-winning, top-selling book by famed author carl hiaasen. the movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography (i want to go to florida now!), humor (thanks to funny-man, luke wilson and some new-comers), and great music! i have to get to get a jimmy buffet cd now! i know a movie is good when i get goose-bumps in the end. overall, it was great family film that i felt comfortable taking my younger niece to. i'd recommend it to any and everyone.
