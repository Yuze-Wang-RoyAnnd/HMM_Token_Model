this movie and its subsequent tv series followup has become the iconic stand-in for what is great about america. <br /><br />fame is famous for its music and performances. there are several standouts including irene cara, paul mccrae, anne meara*, and the superb gene anthony ray. the latter who plays a walk-on dancer with no academic or other than "street" credentials is an amazing personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a portrayal of himself. a wonderment to behold, as one king was apt to say.<br /><br />the plot follows an interesting format - chronological at times, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.<br /><br />where parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant and sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score that matches the performers step for step.<br /><br />the climax of the film is a climax for all times. and this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is thankfully repeated throughout the credits. these are one set of credits that are well worth sitting through ... an achievement for the ages. the music by christopher gore is a gift to behold.
