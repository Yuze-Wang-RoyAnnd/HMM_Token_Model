somehow, changi lost out in the afi awards to my brother jack. the latter, a high-quality adaptation of george johnston's immortal novel, was outstanding - but, in my opinion, not as good as changi. i have heard that many critics dismissed changi as being irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. who and where are these critics? changi is outstanding. more than that. brilliant. it's not supposed to be a documentary - certainly i can forgive the actual changi survivors (or indeed any survivors of a pow camp) for being disappointed with the production - but to the rest of us, changi represents the remarkable power of mateship in times of extreme adversity. it contains a part of the australian culture that appears to be diminishing as times become easier and less challenging, but which we should never forget: australians were respected worldwide after gallipoli and ww2 for their comradery and sense of humour. rating: 96/100. see also: gallipoli; paradise road; the last bullet; the sugar factory.
