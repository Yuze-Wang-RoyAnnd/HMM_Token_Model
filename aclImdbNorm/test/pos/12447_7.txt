this dvd usually sells for around $20. i wouldn't pay this much for the dvd if i had known what i was getting, but regardless this is a pretty good disc. it displays the knot in all their glory, with footage from their concerts... playing surfacing, wait and bleed and scissors among other tracks, including the "spit it out" music video, which was apparently banned from mtv.<br /><br />slipknot, for those who don't know, is essentially a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who display total chaos on stage, with machine gun drums, squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more. for those who've never seen slipknot before, i cannot recommend enough you get this dvd... probably off ebay or amazon so you can get a better deal.<br /><br />a short, though well made show of the knot.<br /><br />seven out of ten.
