i wasn't expecting to much of this movie when i went into the theater but i had been waiting for it for many years. to sum it up, it was pretty damn good! chad michael murray was pretty good, i thought he was going to be another chris flynn from wrong turn but i was wrong. elisha cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to brian van holt. he played the bad guy too well, i mean he was sick, sadistic, and very cruel. the back story between the brothers was good, plus i liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film. it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. jon abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of cmm. i liked how chad kind of cried when he found him dead, it was better then just him being like, "whatever, my buddy is dead, who cares". it showed how he really cared. so overall, this was a darn god slasher with some great effects. bravo!
