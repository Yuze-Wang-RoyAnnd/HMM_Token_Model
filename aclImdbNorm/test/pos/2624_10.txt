this movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-tv movie mysteries i've ever seen. the acting is superb. i've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. i'd love to have a copy so i can play certain parts over and over again. i am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but cannot find it anywhere.i am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? i've tried e-bay, amazon.com, internet searches, and am completely frustrated. i've not seen it on turner classic movies, nor on american movie classics and i have even put out fliers in our community asking if anyone has a copy.
