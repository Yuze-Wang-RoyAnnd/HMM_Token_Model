i saw this when i was twelve. it was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was. i had read the entire happy hollisters children's mystery series and they were about a family of child sleuths who always got their man. but we the readers were not in a position to solve the mystery along with them. this movie showed me that a good mystery is that which makes the viewer/reader, at the end, say, "oh!!!!! of course!!!!!!!"
