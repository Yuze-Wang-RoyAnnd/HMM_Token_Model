this movie gives you more of an idiea how australians act. even though the castle is a great australian movie, it's a bit out there. this movie is by far the best aussie flick i have seen (haven't seen dirty deeds yet) and probably would be my favourite movie. the point is, if you haven't seen it, go see it. if a crime/action/comedy is your thing.
