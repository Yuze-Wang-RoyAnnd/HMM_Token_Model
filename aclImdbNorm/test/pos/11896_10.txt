i love movies that take you into them. a movie that actually leaves you feeling weak when its over and this kind of movie is rare.<br /><br />damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen. this movie has a cutting edge to it. a main stream cast for such a low budget. why is it that a man with this much talent and charisma , ( not to mention sex appeal in ways beyond most other actors ) can do this with so little money to work with????? these actors really believe in his script and raw talent as a director, writer and actor. i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him. damian i have heard of you through so many different circles and do not let the jealous people of this world get to you. martin gets this , fellini got it and you will always get it. the fire and passion in you is what we love to watch on screen. thankyou for being different and having the guts to write like you do. you are a one of a kind director, do not listen to the empty vessels.
