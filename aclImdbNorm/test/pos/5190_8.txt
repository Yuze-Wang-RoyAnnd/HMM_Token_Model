naked city: jwab does a pretty good job of balancing its two a - b stories, eventhough i'm not all that fond of multiple plot movies. and scott glen and courtney b. vance make a great on screen dual. however, i'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two flat-foot country girls can get off scott free with murder, grand theft, and to top it off, win a free flight home (in first class no less--at least from the looks of their attire anyway). gee, i guess that blue wall of silence is still rather think!<br /><br />rating: 8
