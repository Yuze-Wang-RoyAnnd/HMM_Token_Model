spoiler alert--and i really mean it!! read no further unless you are prepared to have a major plot element revealed!!<br /><br />okay, first i've gotta say that i have a relatively high tolerance for depressing films. i'll watch and appreciate films about true life horrors (such as war and the holocaust) or where death and sadness are important to the plot but i hate films like steal magnolias and terms of endearment where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character. so, already no matter how well made this film is, it's got a major strike against it because one of the main characters dies from a disease at the end (though they never say what he had in the english subtitled version).<br /><br />so you might ask yourself, "then if this blow-hard hates this type of film, then why did he watch it in the first place?" you would have an excellent point to ask this, though i hope i am not really a blow-hard! well, when i found it in our local library i had no idea what it was about!!! the movie was not intended specifically for export, as the subtitles were in korean, english and japanese and the box was printed all in korean. well, being a fan of trying films from any nation (i've seen films from probably at least 30-40 different countries), i gave it a try.<br /><br />well, apart from the obligatory death, i loved the film and so hated the way it ended. while i usually hate hollywood-type miraculous endings, i wanted to see the guy saved through some new drug or experimental surgery. i was really bummed that he had to die--particularly since he seemed like one of the nicest people i've seen in films in a long time. his smile was infectious and i really wanted him to get the girl in the end. oh well, at least i can appreciate the film's message that you need to seize the moment. great acting, music, etc., but just not the most satisfying ending for me. this film was good enough to encourage me to try some more korean cinema.
