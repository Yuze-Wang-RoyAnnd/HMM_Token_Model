a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenter's in the mouth of madness (not for the story!) for the atmosphere, the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences. on the other hand, this movie mixes very well the image and the music (note the 4th chapter in the movie)
