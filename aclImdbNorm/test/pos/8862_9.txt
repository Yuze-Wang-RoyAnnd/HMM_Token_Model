antarctica, winter 1982. the team on an american research base get surprised by a couple of mad norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. all the norwegians are killed and the americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. that's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film i've ever seen.<br /><br />from the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. helpless and alone out in no-mans land. ennio morricone was nominated for a razzie award for his score. why i don't know 'cause as far as i can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. it really gets you in the right mood.<br /><br />the acting is great! the best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. as for russell and the others on two legs i can say nothing less.<br /><br />you may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? well, think again! you haven't seen it all until you've seen this. bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... rob bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.<br /><br />the movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. in fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. nobody i've asked have heard of it. however the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and dvd. twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. this movie is to be considered a classic.<br /><br />the movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. i've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time i saw it. as a norwegian the only thing i don't like about this movie is that macready keeps calling the norwegians swedes!
