turner and friends are closing in on hbo for the top spot among made-for-tv movie producers. this is a nicely paced, contemplative thriller of sorts. william macy is stellar, as always, and adam arkin offers one of his better performances. a bit more lively than classic hitchcock but not as in-your-face as typical movies of its type, a slight case of murder eases you in and never lets go. (note: i saw a preview copy, which means i didn't have to wait through commercials. those interruptions may hurt the pacing, but you know this will be available on video sometime
