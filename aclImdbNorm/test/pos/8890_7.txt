a deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle-aged schlub (danny devito) who wants to bump off his mother and hatches a plan to do so with a bitter divorc'ee, who wants to bump off his ex-wife. the movie is completely unapologetic in its cynicism, and gives us no one to like, but for once that works in the movie's favor rather than as a turn off.<br /><br />anne ramsey, as devito's battle axe mom, steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance. even though she's a horror, you end up rooting for her, because it seems like she could kick both devito's and crystal's asses at the same time with both hands tied behind her back.<br /><br />grade: b+
