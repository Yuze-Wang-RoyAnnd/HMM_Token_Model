florence vidor stars as the daughter of a strict bible toting father who throws her out of the house when gossip taints her name. in the big city, she finds the dying wife of her own brother (the two had secretly married) and raises their child on her own. years later, she goes back home to confront her family.<br /><br />this old melodrama is heavily larded with fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but sounding remarkably modern). some of it is laid on with a trowel (as the father, theodore roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout), but it's well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by cinematographer henry sharp.
