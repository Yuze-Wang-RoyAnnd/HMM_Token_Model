jenny lewis plays an awkward girl called jade. she smokes and drinks. she doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(beverly d'angelo). jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend billy(rob estes), maybe she is attracted to him. of course, i don't need to tell you what happens after that. <br /><br />this is probably my favorite tv movie. this movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. this movie also has the best acting that i have seen in tv movies. beverly d'angelo does a really nice job as a sweet and loving but neglectful and blind mother. she couldn't see what was going on under her own roof. rob estes is at his best here as the sleazeball. jenny lewis is the standout. she seems to be exactly like her character.<br /><br />everyone seems to love this movie!
