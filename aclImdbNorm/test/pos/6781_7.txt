found a copy in a bargain bin sale of this old time classic. i played it with dosbox on a vista machine without any issues. it's graphically dated heavily, but what do you expect for a 12 year old game! the game is a fps/adventure game hybrid. it's what i call pseudo 3d, you can't look up or down, just spin in 360 (think wolf3d). game play can get tricky with a very limited supply of health pots, and a somewhat average interface (tip: press i), but on the whole it's passable.<br /><br />one main strength of the game is the mood. there game heavily uses full motion video, and whilst the acting is b-grade and the plot is very choppy, the game as a whole feels genuinely creepy. it also does a good job of making you question the 'good guys'. are they really helping, or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? the other major selling point is the games length. there are from memory 18 chapters, which range in game play time from 10minutes to, potentially, hours. my first play through took me a week with some serious devotion of time.<br /><br />dated, yes, but if you missed this years ago and can find it for $5, give it a look. cheaper than a movie, and more entertaining than most movies.
