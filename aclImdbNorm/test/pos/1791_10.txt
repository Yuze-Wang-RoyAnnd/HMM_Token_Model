like margot in "fear of fear" falls victim of her ambitious husband, like fox in "fox and his friends" is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like xaverl bolwieser in "the stationsmaster's wife" who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like hermann hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also hans epp is a victim of the german "wirtschaftswunder"-society after world war ii in r.w. fassbinder's "the merchant of the four seasons". simply from the fact that fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between hetero- and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not favorize any sex.<br /><br />in hans epp's case there are the women who drive him into despair, illness and finally death. when he comes back from the foreign legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother, she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed. then hans gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute. after having lost his job, he works as a fruit-merchant with little income, going from backyard to backyard "crying out" his produce. his mother, one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a "street-worker" in their family. "the love of his life" (she has no name in the movie) refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin. so he marries irmgard whom he does not love and who does not love him. from her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking. one evening, after his wife was stalking him, he explodes and hits her. she flees to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for. when irmgard is calling a lawyer for divorce, hans suffers a heart attack. imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on, he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol. so he starts to feel more and more superfluous, gets quieter and quieter and more and more depressive. when he finds out that irmgard cheats him, he chooses to end his life, but not like hermann hermann by having a trip into the light of madness, but he drinks himself to death in front of imrgard, their little daughter and his boozing buddies. fassbinder said in an interview that hans knew what he was doing. the question, however is: did hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment, or did he make self-justice?
