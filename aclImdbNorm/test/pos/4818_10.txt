riding high on the success of "rebel without a cause", came a tidal wave of 'teen' movies. arguably this is one of the best. a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen. the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency, than any traumatic occurrence. the supporting cast is memorable, frankenheimer directs like an old pro. just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously.
