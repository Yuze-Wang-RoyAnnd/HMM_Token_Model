before this clip, music videos were merely to display an artist. michael jackson's "thriller" created a whole new section of music videos which can honestly be called mini movies. "thriller" follows a couple as they travel to the girl's house from a movie. on the way they encounter zombies announced by the immortal vincent price. my favorite part is where the zombies stagger in on the couple and the girl turns to see that michael has turned into one of them. then, they do a little dance. the scariest thing about "thriller" may be the fact that it is consistently more fun and enjoyable than a lot of movies that are made. after twenty years it remains the premier music video.<br /><br />p.s. my music video top 5: 5 - madonna "like a prayer" 4 - guns n' roses "sweet child of mine" 3 - nine inch nails "closer" 2 - peter gabriel "sledgehammer" 1 - michael jackson - "thriller"
