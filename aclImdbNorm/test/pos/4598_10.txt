i'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome. i guess it's not for everyone because it's basically kafka's "the trial" meets "beevis and butt-head", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. still, i thought it was great. if you're going to see it because you want a sequel to office space you're probably going to be disappointed. but if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid-tongued, and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat. i just saw the 8pm show opening night in los angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the film will probably be gone in a week. that's really a shame because, in its own way, idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while. but then again it's basically making fun of the people who make up about 99% of the movie-going audience so i guess it's no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it.
