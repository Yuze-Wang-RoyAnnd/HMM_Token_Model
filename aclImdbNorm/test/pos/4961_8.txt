being a d.b. sweeney fan, i've been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time. i recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable. it had some really hilarious scenes. the dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling, but i think the movie also showed that it's possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it's been derailed.
