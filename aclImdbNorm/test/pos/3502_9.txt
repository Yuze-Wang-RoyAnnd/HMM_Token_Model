ali g earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. ali g indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. he has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. a human side to ali is revealed during the film, the idea of ali g running for pm is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. the film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. so why didn't i give it ten stars? well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. and in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's ali g for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. ali g's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on imdb. but it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.<br /><br />on the whole, ali g indahouse is hilarious british comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. a great job! 9/10
