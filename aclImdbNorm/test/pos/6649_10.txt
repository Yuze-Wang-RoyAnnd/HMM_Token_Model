how is it possible to like and dislike the same movie?<br /><br />the plot is very much like that jody foster thing, sommersby, only not as good. nicole was great....jude was adequate. they didn't give him many lines...is there a reason for that? generally, he's a pretty good actor. she's so elegant, his character is so country bumpkin. it makes one wonder what they see in each other.<br /><br />romance between two such was only successful in lady chatterly's lover.<br /><br />i think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long. they could have told the story in two hours.<br /><br />the story is good. good locations, good filming. the character actors were great.
