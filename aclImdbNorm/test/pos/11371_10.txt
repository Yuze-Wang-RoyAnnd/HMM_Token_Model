all right - it was in black and white and probably on 2" tape - which means the bbc wiped it, right? but it stays in my mind from all those years ago (1960??) as a perfect slice of history enlivened by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado.<br /><br />i want to see it again! are you reading this, bbc? find your original 2" tapes or the 35mm film, deal with the actors and directors for the rights, and re-issue! i know, i know, some of them are dead, some of them are missing in action.<br /><br />where else will i be able to see mary morris as the 'serpent's heart wrapped in a tiger's hide'? where else will i be able to see paul daneman do 'now is the winter of discontent....'? or robert hardy deliver his speech about 'that idol ceremony'?
