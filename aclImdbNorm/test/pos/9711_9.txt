where do i begin? i sat down ready to laugh a bit and i was blown away! this movie is just perfect, it's indescribable. jackass number two in all honesty was grosser, more obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first. this was just what i needed tonight.<br /><br />there are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say "oh my! no way!" or "ouch!". perfectly mastered and set up, each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect. i loved every minute of it! i'm just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular footage in order to prevent an nc-17 rating! it was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway! amazingly good.<br /><br />9/10. incredibly funny, do not miss out!
