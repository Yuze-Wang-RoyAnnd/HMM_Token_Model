it may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes didn't fail. i've seen it many times when i was younger and again on dvd i believe, and i laughed each time.the humor is simple and fun,this film was just one of many small flicks disney was throwing out at the time. i found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible. there expressions were priceless great film, if the opportunity to ever see this arises i recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh. my favorite character in all the dexter series would most definitely have to be dean higgins, i love his voice and hearing him get upset especially seeing his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me.
