the marriage of an upscale new york city couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out ("it took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door!" a neighbor tells us); the busy, distracted husband takes on the "motherly" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit (with young justin henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between dustin hoffman and meryl streep!), but the dynamics are intriguing and involving, and director robert benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness, marvelous classical music, canny editing and surefire bits of humor. streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but i was ready to feel a lot more for her than benton probably wanted. it all has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent. the film never falters from its preconceived path, and very fine acting nearly saves it, but i'm not sure where benton was steering the film in the final act, and the closing scene is awfully abrupt. *** from ****
