after watching oldboy i was a little disappointed by the rest of park's work, some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that oldboy had. this one does, it is nothing like oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there.<br /><br />the acting is good with kang-ho song, ok-bin kim and ha-kyun shin delivering excellent performances. kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep.<br /><br />the plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clich'es.<br /><br />the directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen. it does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see.<br /><br />this is just a great film.
