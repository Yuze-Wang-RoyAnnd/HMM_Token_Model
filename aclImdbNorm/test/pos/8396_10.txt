my mother is as gone with the wind as one can be. she has the collector's plates, the rhett and scarlett madame alexander dolls, gwtw christmas ornaments, even a gwtw cookbook! my sister and i had only seen bits and pieces of gwtw but we knew the whole plot by heart. on a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking my mother would like it and we had taken an interest in it after leafing through the novel a bit.<br /><br />yesterday we decided to watch both gone with the wind and scarlett. we started gwtw at about 2:30 in the afternoon and ended it at 6:30. we started scarlett right after. my mother usually goes to bed at about 10:00, she wound up staying up until 1:30 with us to finish it! we were riveted! i like how the movie starts off at melanie's funeral, right where scarlett left off saying, "i'll think about it tomorrow." scarlett doesn't stay in georgia for long, she runs off to charleston in her quest to win him back. rhett is not happy when he finds scarlett in his home so he leaves for the family's plantation. scarlett, being scarlett, follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a time in order to keep the gossip at bay. rhett starts to enjoy her company again and takes her out on his boat. a storm comes up and they sink. he helps her swim to the shore of some island. terrified that she has died, rhett is anxious until she awakes. when she does they both get swept up in the moment and make love. scarlett wakes up the next day back in charleston but rhett has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again.<br /><br />scarlett is heartbroken and when she is so she does some stupid things, in this case she is seen by anne hampton going up into a hotel room alone with ashley. nothing happens, but her reputation is stained so scarlett goes to savannah with her two spinster aunts. she soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell rhett. while in savannah she meets many of her o'hara relatives and grows to like one cousin in particular a father colum. she soon gets her divorce notice from rhett and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to spite him. typical scarlett.<br /><br />she decides to go to ireland to make sure rhett can never discover her condition. she meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home ballyhara. through out this time, rhett is courting anne. it is on halloween when scarlett gets the notice that rhett has remarried, she goes into labor that night.<br /><br />the movie skips to a year later and scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter kat. she is being pursued by lord richard fenton who is really an evil man, forcing a young girl named mary boyle to sleep with him. scarlett meets rhett and anne again at a horse fair. after a riding accident, scarlett has a conversation with anne and learns that she and rhett are to have a baby. heartbroken again, scarlett leaves and goes to dublin with fenton. there she cultivates a relationship with him, like i said, she does stupid things when she is heartbroken.<br /><br />mary boyle has discovered she is pregnant and goes to colum for help. the priest urges fenton to help the girl and fenton murders him after colum threatens to tell scarlett. fenton convinces scarlett to go to london with him to escape her grief over colum's death. mary asks to go with her. back in charleston, anne has died of yellow fever. it is made clear that she never bore rhett a child.<br /><br />in london, scarlett sees fenton's true colors after he hurts her when she isn't in the mood the sleep with him. fenton rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again. she falls unconscious after and when she wakes up fenton has been stabbed to death. scarlett is charged with his murder.<br /><br />rhett hears about it and rushes off to england with sally in tow. fearful of the gallows, scarlett has no choice but to tell rhett about their daughter. rhett is furious at her for keeping such a secret but stays to help her. mary boyle, the real killer, can't be found. scarlett is found guilty but mary finally arrives to declare her innocence. after promising to help mary, scarlett leaves with rhett for ireland because as he says, "it's time i became acquainted with my daughter." the scene where he sees kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. in ireland, rhett sees how much scarlett has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit they still love each other deeply.<br /><br />after seeing gwtw, i will say that yes, vivian leigh was a better scarlett, but i liked the character of scarlett in this film than in the first. the reason being that in gwtw, you don't know why you like scarlett. she's so cruel to rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. in scarlett, you see how much she has changed. oh she is still in the lap of luxury, but she's not haughty anymore. you see how she becomes a true mother to kat and a generous person to the poor people of ireland. joanne whalley does and excellent job at playing this new side of scarlett. timothy dalton is not clark gable, but at times you swear that you can see original rhett in him.<br /><br />if you just sit back and not compare joanne whalley and timothy dalton with vivian leigh and clark gable, you will most certainly enjoy this movie. it's a chance to compare the scarlett of yesterday, the one she becomes after "tomorrow".
