i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites. this is a spoof on the french cottage industry of oss 117 films of the 50's and 60's. the first oss 117 film based on the novel by jean bruce was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first james bond film, staring ivan desny as hubert bonisseur de la bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with luc merenda, frederick stafford, kerwin matthews and john gaven all taking turns as oss 117. jean dujardin is in the title role in this comedic take on the series. as the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like sean connery. jean francois halim wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. it borrows on the silliness of naked gun, get smart and the pink panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and i am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived oss 117 reworked to comedy adventures. michel hazanavicius directs. i would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.
