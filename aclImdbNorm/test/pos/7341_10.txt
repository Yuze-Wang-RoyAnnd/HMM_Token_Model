thankyou for making such a wonderful escape . that's what i love about movies. i'm so impressed with the aireals , the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music .being a dancer myself , and having been a part of many dance films choreography is usually chopped ,diced and sometimes not even to the beat....."showgirls" the movie . the relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement .<br /><br />my favorite scene is the last one, when she is pulled over . i've seen the movie before, a different version ., and i disliked the husband more last time . i felt a little more sorry for him this time . it changes how i feel about the female love birds. its all so magical .
