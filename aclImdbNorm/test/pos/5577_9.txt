i think that farscape is the best scifi since babylon 5 and is one of the best sci-fi television series of all time (ranking up there with dr. who, blake's 7, red dwarf, mst3k and the aforementioned b5). i find the characters and races of farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical "humans-with-birthmarks" that are found in many series. the effects are quite good and the stories engaging. despite missing the bulk of season 2 and some of season 1, i find the character development very well done.
