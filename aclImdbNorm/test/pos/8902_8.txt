having been a faithful asterix fan all of my life, i have to say that "asterix and the vikings" is probably the most well done of all the asterix films. its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb. as many people have pointed out, it doesn't really follow the plot of the comic ("asterix and the normans") very closely, but in many ways that's just as well, because that book stands out in my mind as one which poked a great deal of fun at the culture of the sixties, and much of it is very dated today.<br /><br />what really rubbed me the wrong way, though, is how they incorporated a disney-style plot into the film which took much of the focus away from asterix and obelix. we have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit in, justforkix. we have a tom-boy girl who doesn't fit in because she wants to be treated as equal to men, abba. they meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because boy is ashamed to be totally honest with girl, but in the end their love wins out. this has been the plot of so many disney (and, be fair, other studios too) films that its not funny and the plot was old twenty years ago. i mean, they even gave justforkix a whimsical animal sidekick.<br /><br />not only did i find this derivative and clich'ed, but it really detracted from the story and left me dissatisfied.<br /><br />i think that it speaks volumes about how superb the rest of the movie was that i still think very highly of it, despite the way the plot got hijacked.
