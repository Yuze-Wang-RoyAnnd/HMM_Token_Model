i just adore this film! i love all characters and i can watch it again<br /><br />and again...and i use to listen to the soundtrack again and again.<br /><br />although i have seen it about two years after it was made and i<br /><br />have never been such youngster as jip and company i can<br /><br />understand them and i love their stories. and if somebody thinks this film is crap, i disagree and i say it is<br /><br />full of positive energy and friendship and love...and full of youth!<br /><br />the weekend has landed...enjoy it!
