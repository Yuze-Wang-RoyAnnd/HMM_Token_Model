the inspiration for this film was the fact that american gangsters are well dresses, but the aussies, well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the blighter, then you can dress as badly as you want and people won't criticize you.<br /><br />jimmy is fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes bouncer and is offered work by pando, the local gangster boss in the cross (that is, australia's notorious kings cross district, not the cross of london fame as many a british backpacker finds out the hard way).<br /><br />due to feelings of love he stuffs up a job, loses a lot of money and has to get it to pando before pando and his heavies can kill him.<br /><br />lots of dark humour, interesting action, revelations about the australia's underside and human nature. it is very centred in the australian nature and explores the nature of australian criminals (versus the american and british ones).<br /><br />one problem is that each of the elements of the story don't have enough substance and depth, but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a lot of area not covered previously, so as an overall package it is worthwhile.<br /><br />team it up with "chopper" and "dirty deeds" for your aussie crime fest or "lock stock and two smoking barrels" and "miller's crossing" for an international falling short of the criminal gangs fest.<br /><br />by the way, bryan brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies. here is one of his great movies.
