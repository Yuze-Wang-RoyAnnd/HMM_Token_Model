(r#88) brilliant, very entertaining show with spectacular effects. any fan of these prehistoric reptiles has to see this. the cgi blends in extremely well with the environment and it's just plain fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as on discovery channel. this show was a stroke of genius and it blows its followers "walking with beasts" and "the future is wild" out of the water.<br /><br />the greatest episode was definitely the last, where we got to watch the final days of the tyrannosaurus rex and the meteor strike that became their doom. this stuff is almost too awesome for television. how about a theatrical release? i would pay anything to see these dinos in the cinema.<br /><br />if you're in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, this is for you. dinosaurs have never been cooler.
