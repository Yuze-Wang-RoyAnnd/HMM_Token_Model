i saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. i go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". i found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. it was worth my money and my tears :)<br /><br />diane lane was wonderful as always, richard gere isn't an over-actor. he held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. he brings his own style to the movie.<br /><br />i think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told. it was messy and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other.<br /><br />i'd definitely recommend it!
