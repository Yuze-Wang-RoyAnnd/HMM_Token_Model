the paul kersey of death wish 3 is very far removed from the paul kersey of the original film . if you remember the 1974 film then you will remember kersey was a " conchie " during the korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . ten years later kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . but i`ll overlook that gaffe because dw3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes . yeah i know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from kersey and the innocent citizens . who needs mayor rudy when you`ve got paul kersey , an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps . paul kersey i salute you sir
