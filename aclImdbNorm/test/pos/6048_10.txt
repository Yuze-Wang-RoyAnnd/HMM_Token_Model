by today's standards the di might seem a little hokey. lee emery's version is more accurate. i graduated boot camp in parris island, sc in 1964. jim moore is as close to the real thing as you could put on the screen in 1957. i can't comment on the plot but i thought the ending was unrealistic for mcrd. pvt owens is like many who found himself in a lot more difficult situation than he bargained for. like so many he joined the marine corps for all the wrong reasons. my drill intructors were more like gysgt hartman than tsgt jim moore. a lot more. the di is more korean era and full metal jacket is more viet nam era. today's movies allow that sort of thing on the screen. i have the di in my collection. i only recently found it on dvd.
