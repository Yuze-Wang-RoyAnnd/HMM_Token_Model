so. i was completely in love with this movie. gaga for it, even with all its plot twists...but the one thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in tim and kyle. while the writer of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation/confusion, he then gives us a plot twist that makes them half brothers?!?! (although the subject isn't brought up in the film....and left unexplained and unaccounted for) i just thought that it was in bad taste, and the fact that it wasn't even discussed is even worse. (oops we've created a taboo...now let's not address the situation, because that wouldn't really be p.c.) otherwise a spectacular film
