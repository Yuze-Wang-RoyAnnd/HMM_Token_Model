i put this movie on not expecting much, other than a b movie gore fest. thankfully i was presented with a very well made film, that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time. this was an impressive achievement. the acting was solid, creating characters that you cared about and related to; and although some may find the film slow, it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably. an excellent effort then, that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore.
