i have to admit that i liked this film much more than i expected to. will smith has that clean-cut charm that you just can't help but like. the plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff, somewhat reminiscent of jane austen's "emma". this guy kevin james has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy. i have never seen his tv show, but he was cast very well in this film. amber valletta was good enough. i can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film, but if she was supposed to be an actress or model, then the casting might have left something to be desired. i enjoyed julie ann emery, and wish she'd had a larger part. but, saving the best for last, eva mendes more or less stole the show. her beauty, and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishness had me glued to the screen whenever she was there. i hope to see more of her in the future. this film is definitely worth checking out.
