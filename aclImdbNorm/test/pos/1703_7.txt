the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to "an american werewolf in london". none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name. so as a sequel, aawip fails, one would say.<br /><br />i dare to say the opposite.<br /><br />an american werewolf in paris is a charming, effective horror movie. it's one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too. and i have seen quite my share, such as an american werewolf in london, the howling, wolfen, the wolfman and the underworld trilogy.<br /><br />the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation. at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed...<br /><br />i really liked the acting in this film. especially the two stars of the movie: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. they have good chemistry together. but the other two americans also play their roles nicely. i didn't really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that! <br /><br />the effects on the werewolves are nice. it doesn't look too cheap or fake to me. of course, the opinions are divided about this subject. but let's just say that i wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />there's also a good amount of humor in this movie. there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time.<br /><br />so, to sum it up, an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor, but it's still an enjoyable movie. perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!
