this movie was so cool! i saw it on a friday night with a couple of my friends. while the first credits were rolling, we saw that lionsgate films had made this movie. they are the ones that made that stupid movie wolf creek, which was totally gay! when we saw this, we groaned. we thought it was going to be like wolf creek, but we were so wrong! the movie was not only better than wolf creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies i have seen in a long time! they really redeemed themselves with this movie. it was gory, smart, and scary, which are the combinations to an awesome horror movie. kane is awesome as jacob goodnight, and christina vidal, samantha noble, and luke pegler did pretty good jobs as part of a group of delinquents cleaning an old motel. it had some gross scenes, and you actually kinda feel sad for some of the people who die. all in all, a great horror movie to watch on a friday or saturday night with the lights off and with friends. just don't watch it in a hotel.
