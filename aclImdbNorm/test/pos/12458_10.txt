before i review this film, i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer. anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that i've always been controversial in a low-key sense, giving high marks for flops such as "captain america" and 1985's "creature" and panning such film classics as alistar sim's "a christmas carol" and "shakespeare in love." with that in mind, this confession might not come as a surprise:<br /><br />the simple fact is, christopher lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. woah, now, don't start getting crazy on me just yet. let me explain myself: i by no means think he's the greatest actor in the world. i clearly confess that he is not. he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins, but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis. what i admire about him, however, are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes. he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. it takes a lot, in my opinion, to be able to bring out those qualities in a character (especially in the movies he's worked in), and lambert's heroes are a far cry from schwartzennegger's or stallone's. quite frankly, lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to. hence, he's not the greatest actor in the world....he's just a personal favorite.<br /><br />i can't say that same, however, for his films. however much i appretiate his acting, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired. most of them are, quite frankly, terrible, and any ridicule that he's gotten over the years from me isn't due to his acting, but rather his bad choice in scripts.<br /><br />with that in mind, i can say that his debut film, "tarzan," is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance. as i mentioned, it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role, and for how seriously the director, writers and actors handle the material. this is a far leap from the b-movie action adventures with johnny weismeller from the 1940's. in fact, i would hesitate to call it an action movie. instead, it is a serious drama that takes all of e.r. burrough's material seriously, showing tarzan's quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesn't fit in as a "white ape." he is torn in between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role. in an attempt to adapt to humans, his ape instincts also kick in, and he can't decide what he loves more: his real family, or the one that he's always known. all in all, it is a wonderful commentary on society, and a wonderful character study.<br /><br />if nothing else, it launched lambert into international stardom, which continued will into the 1980's with films like "highlander" and "he sicilian." unfortunately, it didn't last. but just wait a while....his latest career moves such as "gideon" and "resurrection" have proven that though he still have a long way to go, he's a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a... ahem.... comeback if he'll just pick his roles better.<br /><br />for now, however, here's the verdict on his first film:<br /><br />*** out of ****
