this film is so wonderful it captures the gaming life. i laughed so hard while watching this. the movie is about a gaming group that have a hard time with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with. the movie switches from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign it shows them in the gaming world as their character, and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing. the campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master, lodge, is writing. the problem is lodge can't finish his module because the characters can't finish the campaign. they are more for killing and looting instead of role playing. lodge wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before. they decide to bring in some extra help so they bring a,wait for it, girl in to play. lodge also makes a npc, a non player character, a paladin,who can not witness or do wrong, to play. the film is how they do all this and more i don't want to spoil any of the film so i won't say any more. this movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be oscar worthy but if you are into gaming or into dungeons and dragons then definitely watch it. they had a lot of fun making this film and it shows i am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun. there is some slap stick comedy which i enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion. so if you want a fun film try it .
