kevin tenney's "night of the demons" is an enjoyable horror film that reminds me a little bit "the evil dead".on hallowen night,a group of teens throws a party in hull house,an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town.lead by angela,they perform a seance-like ceremony and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place.one by one,the uninvited evil force possesses the teens,turning them into bloodthirsty demons."night of the demons" is a perfect horror film.it is scary,gory and pretty atmospheric.the characters are well-developed and the gore by steve johnson is pretty good.there is a gruesome impaling,a tongue being bitten off,fingers shoved into eye-sockets,etc.the scene,where suzanne(linnea quigley)shoves a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a hoot.give this one a look.followed by two sequels.
