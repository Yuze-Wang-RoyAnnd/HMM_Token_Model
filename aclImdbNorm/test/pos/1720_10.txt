i love pop culture, but i was a little apprehensive when i first heard about this. then, i seen an episode, and i love it! i was a little upset when i found out that christopher eccelson would no longer be playing doctor who. he was probably the best one they've had. he fits the character so well. it's sad to see him go. i really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as eccelson.<br /><br />i think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures, such as the darleks. the story lines and characters can more than make up for that. i'm currently waiting for season two and i will review that as well, in case, for any reason, quality goes down.<br /><br />anyways, i think everyone should try to see one episode. i did, and i have been loving it ever since. well written, well casted, and well produced, this show is worth the hour of viewing. doctor who gets a 10/10
