being a seasoned fan of italian thrillers and directors dario argento, mario bava, sergio martino and aldo lado, i thought of lucio fulci as an overrated hack. i had seen the beyond which i think is totally overrated, i found the new york ripper to be simply appalling and i didn't particularly like the house by the cemetery. these three movies left me to conclude that fulci is the least interesting of these italian filmmakers. but my stubbornness prevailed and i had to check out more of his films. city of the living dead was a film i found very interesting but don't torture a duckling is very nearly a masterpiece.<br /><br />set in a small town in the italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered. the authorities are clueless as to who's behind these crimes, especially after their prime suspect has been cleared. an eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl (who seduces young boys) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case with 70's italian thrillers) make don't torture a duckling a crackling good thriller. the plot is well constructed, not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying. fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals, particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk. fulci's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled. when thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo new york ripper it's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. so far i haven't seen any fulci film made as professionally as this one.<br /><br />while not a traditional giallo film, duckling has many of the genre's trademarks. fulci displays complete control over the format, only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore-moment, but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics. the extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch.<br /><br />so far don't torture a duckling is fulci's best film by far in my opinion. edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot.
