even if it's not labeled as a slasher flick, it has all the elements. the fact that slashers are well known for it's low budget, lame plot, cheesy effects, and everything you may add, it doesn't means that there can't be good slasher movies. "opera" fills the description. even though it's part of italian giallo; which is far from being a slasher sub-genre.<br /><br />dario argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in horror. "opera" is one of the most stylish horror movies from the past 30 years. though the movie takes place in a beautiful, shinning place; the situations and gore turns it to be one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. <br /><br />i think of "opera" as a stylish slasher although there's in depth plot and character development. the cheese factor often used in most slasher flicks is not present here but in exchange we got a suspenseful, visually stunning gore tale. the movie's plot is simple (as in every slasher). there's a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress/singer and forces her to watch gruesome deaths. the death scenes are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie. the infamous "peep-hole" death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. it's a terrific death scene that none other than argento could release. the knife through the neck (and mouth) is another gruesome scene but less violent than the scissors death. the gore in "opera" will please the wicked and lovers of violence.<br /><br />what i didn't like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. i mean, after watching the first death, the lead female, calmed as if nothing happened gets a ride home and doesn't makes much of a big deal about what she saw. also, she's left alone in home and doesn't take security measures. still, the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. for example, when betty's friend tells her that someone was watching her from outside she freaks out and sets suspense in case that something happens. <br /><br />the direction of the movie is great. for an italian giallo it's excellent. argento's creative pov shots are impressive. the ravens also added a creepy feeling to the movie. argento add his unique spice. <br /><br />"opera" is one of the most underrated but popular through the horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: -the peep-hole death scene (brilliant) -the ravens attack in the end -the opera setting -the knife through the neck and mouth -the heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music never freaked me out before) -the killer's ferocity<br /><br />the only thing i don't like about "opera" is the heavy metal songs used in death scenes. it's ok to disturb the audience but i think that the opera music could've added a creepier feeling. still, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a singular disturbing aspect in the movie.<br /><br />watch "opera" even if you don't like gore. there's a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person. this is no "suspiria" but it deserves to be among argento's finest.
