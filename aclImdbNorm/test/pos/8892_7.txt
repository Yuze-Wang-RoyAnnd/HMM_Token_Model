the college teacher larry donner (billy cristal) is a blocked writer since his former wife margareth (kate mulgrew) ruined him, stealing his novel that became a best-seller. he does not hide his hatred for margareth, upsetting his girlfriend beth ryan (kim greist), who is an anthropologist teacher in the same college. while giving classes of creative writing, he is stalked by the student owen (danny devito) that wants to know his opinion about his crime tale. larry tells that he did not like it, and explains that in every mystery tale, the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he would get caught. further, larry suggests owen to watch hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story. owen, who wants to kill his detestable mother (anne ramsey), watches "strangers on a train" and misunderstands larry's advice, believing that his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive. owen travels to hawaii and while in a ship, margareth falls overboard vanishing in the sea and is considered dead. however, larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while the deranged owen presses him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal.<br /><br />"throw momma from the train" is one of the funniest comedies of the 80's and a great tribute to alfred hitchcock. the direct reference is "strangers on a train", but there are jokes with "vertigo" (with the spinning camera), "family plot" (with the car without breaks) and other movies. the lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when larry tells that every great romance or mystery has a train. anne ramsey is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive dominating mother and the viewer will certainly feel sorrow and understand the insanity of owen. kim greist is very beautiful and kate mulgrew is the perfect bitch. billy cristal performs an obsessed character with many silly and unreasonable attitudes but necessary to the plot. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "jogue a mam~ae do trem" ("throw momma from the train")
