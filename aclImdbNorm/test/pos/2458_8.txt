an under-appreciated, unseen gem. estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant, heartbreaking fashion, the tension that arises between a son who's been to hell and back, and his parents, who can't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. it's not unlike born on the fourth of july, in that it deals with a soldiers' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in vietnam, but while that one focused more on the politics of post-vietnam (anti-war speeches, etc.), this one deals with a much more personal topic: family. one man's struggle to return to normalcy after a life-altering experience, and his parents' failure to see the change that has occurred.<br /><br />estevez delivers a smoldering performance as jeremy collier. you can sense the pain and frustration bubbling beneath surface. there to match him inch for inch is his real-life father, martin sheen. it's a trip watching these two act off of each other, as you get the sense that they're constantly trying to one-up one another. it's like the presence of each other inspired the pair to do their best, and their performances triumph because of it.<br /><br />recommended to anyone who appreciates solid acting, writing and directing. and to any vietnam war buff. <br /><br />****/***** (8/10)
