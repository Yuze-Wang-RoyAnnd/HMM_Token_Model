this is a surprisingly great low budget horror/comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending!. all the characters are pretty cool, and the story while unoriginal is very good, plus eric jungmann(adam) and justin urich(harley) had fantastic chemistry together. one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when adam is trapped in the bathroom, and harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there, and decides to take a p*ss in the truck, and aimee brooks is just plain sexy!, plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time. it's very gory, but in a comical way, and i thought it was very well written as well, plus michael bailey smith is fantastic as the monster man and had some wicked makeup!. it's similar to films like joy ride, duel, jeepers creepers, etc, etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there, plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part. this is a surprisingly great low budget horror/comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. michael davis does a very good! job here, with great camera work, good angles,good use of colors, and using a great setting, plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace.<br /><br />there is a lot of gore!. we get extremely bloody nose bleeds,gory impaling's, bloody stabbings,guy is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a cooked stew, guts all over the place,guys guts fall out,pencil in the eyes,bloody slit throat,bunch of people walking around without limbs,gory dead squirrel,heads are squished,severed limbs,bloody and mangled corpses,decent amount of bloodshed,one very gory scene at the very end and more!.<br /><br />the acting is very good for a low budget film. eric jungmann is fantastic here as adam, he was a nerd but a very likable one, he had fantastic chemistry with justin urich, had some cool lines,and i just loved his character, he also seemed to be enjoying himself,and he was especially good at the end!. justin urich is excellent as the ass of a best friend, however i just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny, and often stole a lot of the scenes, i really dug him!. aimee brooks is gorgeous, and did great with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with jungmann and like jungmann was especially good at the end, as i loved her mysterious character. michael bailey smith is wonderful as the monster man he was very creepy looking, had some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers!. rest of the cast do fine.<br /><br />overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5
