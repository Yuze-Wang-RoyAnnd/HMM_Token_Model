"fame" is a very well done portrait of the students who inhabit new york city's high school of the arts. the film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while they perfect their craft at the now famous school. director alan parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on screen, allowing you to feel a connection with each one. the music here is infectious and fun. the dancing is exciting and fresh. the film eventually became the basis for an emmy-winning television series starring debbie allen and some of the other actors from the film. one of the more enjoyable "dance" films of the 1980's. received oscars for music. 8/10
