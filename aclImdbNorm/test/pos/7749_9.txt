this show is great. not only is "haruhai suzumiya" a very well written anime show, it also reflects things like philosophy, science fiction and a little religion. it's hilarious at some points and "cute" (for lack of a better term) at others. actually this may be effect to my lack of experience with japanese anime shows, but it is one of the best of its genre i have seen.<br /><br />i mainly have to give credit to the writers. i haven't seen such brilliant scopes of imagination in a television show since the original star trek. i hope the writers continue to add strange new characters and give more insight on the already great characters that have been added.<br /><br />9/10
