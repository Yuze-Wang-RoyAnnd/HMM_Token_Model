this is my fourth review of a charlie chan movie in series chronological order on these consecutive days. this is also my first comment of one i've seen previously though it's been about 24 years since then, so i didn't remember much of it. in this one, the honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by a former scotland yard acquaintance who has turned up missing in the big apple...this is the best of the chan entries i've seen so far in current memory with every clue being connected (though, of course, if i look at them at closer examination, there could still be some holes though i can't think of any right now). and "no. 2 son" jimmy (victor sen yung) is somewhat of a help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders early on, though, of course, he blunders a little later. among the returning supporting cast from the last chan film-charlie chan at the wax museum-are blonde joan valerie as june preston and stanley blystone, who's brother john g. helmed a lost chan one called charlie chan's chance, as a fingerprint expert. nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane. oh, and watch for a certain stooge at a police line up...
