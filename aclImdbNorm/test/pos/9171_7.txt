over the past century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of movies. i'm not talking about what goes on behind the camera, i'm referring to the tastes of the audience. the idea of a "chick flick" is alive and well today, while there are still plenty of action and horror films which appeal primarily to males. sure, there are men and women who enjoy the movies that fall outside of their typical demographic, but there aren't many movies which have appeals across the board. hitch, the latest will smith vehicle attempts to change that trend by being a chick flick which throws in a dose of male perspective.<br /><br />smith stars in hitch as the title character, alex "hitch" hitchens, a "date doctor" who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date. hitch enjoys his job and loves to see men successfully accomplish their goals of going out with the woman of their dreams, but due to a bad experience in college, hitch himself is somewhat sullied on the idea of love. as the story unfolds, the film introduces two seemingly separate story lines. hitch's latest case is albert brennaman (kevin james), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress allegra cole (amber valletta). hitch has his doubts about albert's chances, but if his clients desires seem sincere, hitch supports them.<br /><br />in the mean time, hitch meets gossip columnist sara melas (eva mendes) and is instantly attracted to this strong woman. however, the date doctor can't seem to follow his own advice in pursuing sara. things get even more complicated when sara's job leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress. will hitch be able to balance his private life and his job? and more importantly, can hitch believe in love again? if you are a true movie fan, then there's been at least one time in your life when you've complained about the redundancy of the hollywood movie factory and cried out for something new and original. well, hitch ain't that movie. but, most movie fans will also admit that occasionally a formulaic movie can work solely on an entertainment level. hitch does qualify as that film.
