i think i was recommended this film by the lady in the shop i was hiring it from! for once she was bang on! what a superb film! first of all i was convinced james mcavoy & romola garai were irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film i was utterly convinced steven robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure james mcavoy was also! when i watched the special features on the dvd and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say i was blown away would be an understatement!!! i can remember all the acclaim dustin hoffmann got back in the 80's for his portrayal of autism in the film 'rain man' - quite frankly (in my opinion of course!)steven robertson's performance/portrayal blows dustin hoffmann's right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such!! all in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship/love/relationships ever - and it was made in britain/ireland with home grown actors - stick that in yer pipe and smoke it hollywood!
