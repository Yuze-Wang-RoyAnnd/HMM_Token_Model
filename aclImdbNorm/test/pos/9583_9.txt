its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown.<br /><br />i don't think alan bates has done a better film than this.<br /><br />its never shown on television. the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of 1998. i have it on tape but sadly the quality isn't great due to a dodgy aerial at the time...<br /><br />i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv. it was shown on channel 4 in the early hours of the morning, thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience.<br /><br />i was living in bristol at the time and it was ironic that, when i finally saw the film, i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before!! the film treads a fine line; a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes.<br /><br />the direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste.<br /><br />a couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of bri and victoria hamilton playing sheila.<br /><br />it showed izzard improvising and larking about and hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he's being like this.<br /><br />i maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful.<br /><br />izzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i saw.<br /><br />it is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed.<br /><br />this is one of the best british films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day.
