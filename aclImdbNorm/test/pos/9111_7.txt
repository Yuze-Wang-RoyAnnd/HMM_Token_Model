when i first heard that jack black and kyle gass would make a movie about their band i was freaking out! i love their music and i hoped that this movie would be really funny! now that i have watched it i can't really say that these hopes weren't satisfied but i think i expected more. the movie is full of tenacious d's great music and i really loved listening to all of it. there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story, at least the first bit. i don't like the way the movie ends. the ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more.<br /><br />overall i think it is a good movie to watch! everyone who likes rock music should watch it! it'll give you a good laugh!
