i saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of 'beyond redemption'. i was searching for new material to watch, since most of the reruns one saturday morning didn't interest me. i've always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael ironside, so i chose this movie. i was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />personally, i enjoyed the film. rich roesing, who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box, are well justified. i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film. this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page.<br /><br />i like suspense movies, and this one was no exception. the movie kept me guessing until the very end. i was surprised by the ending!<br /><br />the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense. his reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian, yet conflictual, side of police work. the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition.<br /><br />if you like suspense films, but also like films that expound on the character's feeling, personal inflection side, this film is for you.<br /><br />should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system's guide, watch it!<br /><br />however, if you are looking for a rental video, follow rich roesing's advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it.
