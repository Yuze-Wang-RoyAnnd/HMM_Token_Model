i shouldn't like jackass number two. no one should. there is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about jackass. and yet...it's one of the funniest things i have ever seen - and i simply cannot explain why.<br /><br />this new movie leaves the first one in the dust. it's so funny, so horrible and so wrong. the whole team give their all - with jackss in chief knoxville leading the charge. he's nuts. i adore him, but he's insane. and more power to him. with his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he threw himself, almost literally, back into the world of the 'ass so wholeheartedly makes me oddly respect him. more kudos must go to bam margera who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted. here bam isn't the tormentor but the tormented and is all the better for it.<br /><br />i simply can't say what my favourite part is because i laughed the whole way through. admittedly i viewed much of the movie from between my fingers, but there hasn't been a 'real' movie i've seen in a very long time that made me feel as invigorated as this did. love them or most probably hate them, the jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations. but i do agree with bam. there can never be a jackass number three because someone will die and i want these guys to stick around.
