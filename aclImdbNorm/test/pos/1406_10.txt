haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on west point and joan crawford, the local beauty. great fun for the first half. and amazingly touching after haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. the new, humility-filled haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. great, rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film, shows billy at his best. william bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. the handsome-but-goony character would be played by clark gable, cary grant, gary cooper and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by carole lombard and marion davies. west point is a winner!
