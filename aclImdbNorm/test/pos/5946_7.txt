pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re: the look of the 1960s spy films and the way the action was staged back then. the fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a peter lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. a big plus: jean dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. plus his eyebrows deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job. <br /><br />funny aside: the people behind me in the theater kept gasping after every plot twist as if they were watching a 'real' spy thriller.<br /><br />before the movie started, a trailer for "get smart" was screened. the preview made the movie look embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to incorporate the jokes and gags from the tv series. looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and gags of oss 117, though, of course, oss had its share of misfires. the overall tone of oss, however, was not an insult to the audience's intelligence, and the material didn't feel as it had been 'dumbed down.' i did get the distinct impression that if i understood the language, i would have caught more of the jokes, and one in particular (the pistol gag) was mishandled in the interpretation for the subtitles.
