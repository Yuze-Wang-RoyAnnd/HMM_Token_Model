i saw this performance on tv and taped it. my daughter played it over and over again. i loaned out at work and everyone just loved it. it is just brilliant physical comedy. bill made an appearance here in california, (he was working and living in new york) and performed the regard of flight on stage. i was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance.<br /><br />bill was awarded a federal endowment, and my daughter wrote him a letter of congratulations, and bill was so kind to write her a note back and enclose a photograph.<br /><br />people ask me, and i can't decide if he is a comedian, and actor, or a clown. actually he is all three. i really wish this was on dvd, my tape is lost.
