the end of suburbia, as it should appeal to general citizens & mass consumers alike, is likely to become of cultural reform status. the film uses super-cynical analysis by authors, policy makers, and social philosophers on the paradox created by suburban-style living--mainly in the post-war era.<br /><br />what we have created in america is a place with "none of the amenities of country life, and none of the amenities of urban city life." this is the prescription that is laid out for suburbia, and the film focus's on the singular idea of "oil". basically, in the most general sense, that the world is nearing or at it's peak oil production, and when we realize this in full, major lifestyle changes will be in effect, whether by our best interest or forced violently upon us by a quality of living even the slum-dwellers of calcutta couldn't describe to us.<br /><br />if nothing more, the end of suburbia will siphon the viewer flush in their gut, creating a sickening feeling. this is bound to happen. it's a bleak outlook on our inherent way of life. the ambivalence lies particularly in each respective viewers critical analysis of the film. i foresee many unprepared viewers slandering the film as smug liberal propaganda--like a michale moore film. what they fail to consider is that a reaction like this is all too normal when such a message hits so unbelievably hard to the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses.<br /><br />this is the truth, and as a student studying city planning, i can tell you that we better get prepared now, because what slim chance we have of maintaining quality of life in this dwindling cesspool of tampered resources is fading faster than a race of people stricken by the black plague.
