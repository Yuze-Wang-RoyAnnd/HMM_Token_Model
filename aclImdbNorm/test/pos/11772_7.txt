this is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare, besides that it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />hardware wars is the only good spoof on star wars, other films like spaceballs have failed. this is the only good spoof film i have ever seen, it doesn't rip-off star wars, it makes fun of it, and that's what spoofs are supposed to be.
