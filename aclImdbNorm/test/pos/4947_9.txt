iron eagle has always been one of my favirote films for a long time now. it looks like topgun but with a different plot and (a lot of people will disagree with me here) in my view it's better than topgun.<br /><br />this film has some amazing dogfight scenes when the fighter jets are zooming through the air. it also has the queen song "one vision" thumping in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song.<br /><br />to be honest, iron eagle was very good but it's sequels were rubbish.<br /><br />
