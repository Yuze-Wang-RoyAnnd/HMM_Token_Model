this is one of the best films made about the 80 punk scene. i saw this a few years back on a "bootleg" copy and was amazed. very few of todays kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends such as the germs and shows how it was back then. nowadays so much punk has gone mainstream with mtv and radio and its nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene. darby crash (of the germs) is one of my heros and this film shows why. a must see for all "punks" and anyone curious about the 80s punk scene
