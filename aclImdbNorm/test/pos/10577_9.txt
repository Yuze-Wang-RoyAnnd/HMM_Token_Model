i had never read any of sarah waters' novels, or watched tipping the velvet. i only heard about fingersmith when i was flipping through "the l word" websites. the storyline of fingersmith interested me, yet i passed it away, thinking "lesbian in victorian period, that never ends well, i have enough of those lesbo series and movies that go no where"<br /><br />however, during christmas my local dvd store gave fingersmith a discount, i brought the dvd, and my life has never been more colourful<br /><br />this mini series deserves to be cherished and praised. the acting is so great that i call it rare. sally hawkins, elaine cassidy, rupert evans, imelda staunton, and many more that i can't name all, brought light and darkness to their characters. just by a little gesture, a little look, a little touch, they made their characters real and as a viewer, i couldn't help it but take them home, keep them close. <br /><br />fingersmith, sets in victorian area, is a story of sue-a thief who loves and lives with her "family" of pick-pockets. little did she know that her fate is linked to maud lily-a somewhat shy, timid girl grows up in a mansion miles and miles away. maud's mother left her a fortune, but maud herself can't touch it, unless she married. worst of all, maud's uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her prisoned in the house. <br /><br />enter mr gentlement, a charming, good-looking thief with a heart as bad as any. he wants maud's fortune for himself, and in order to do so he sets sue up as maud lily's maid, asking sue to persuade maud to elope with him. as time goes by, things would be simple, if sue didn't fall in love with maud. <br /><br />and things would be simple, if the story was what i have just told. i do not wish to spoil, so i would like to stop there. but i can asure you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even aware of what has happened. once it happened, you then question what would happen next. on top of that, the story is filled with passion unlike any others. there are no self-searching, sexuality questioning, "oh my god do i like girls" moments, because the girls in fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they barely be able to care. the story with such twisted plot moves as smooth as water, running passionately, but strangely calm. <br /><br />weeks have passed since i watched "fingersmith", yet maud's eyes still haunt me, and sue's words still warm my heart "you pearl, you pearl, you pearl", she said. and such pearl it is.
