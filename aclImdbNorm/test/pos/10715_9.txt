inexplicably, i watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago, and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about. this movie held my attention from beginning to end, and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and might have helped me discover a few i never knew about.)<br /><br />dustin hoffman absolutely shines as ted kramer. he is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted husband, workaholic ad executive and loving father. meryl streep as joanna kramer was less central to the movie simply because joanna was absent for a good part of it, but when she was on screen she gave hoffman a run for his money. the true standout, though, (in my opinion) had to be young justin henry as billy kramer. children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with dad, only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his dad when it was his mom who walked out on him. young justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role.<br /><br />all in all, this is an excellent, oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what i thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle ted and joanna had gone through. but there's not much else to complain about here.<br /><br />9/10
