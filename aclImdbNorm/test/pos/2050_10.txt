this is movie is actually one of my all time favorites. i'm not a renny harlin fan because most of his movies suck, but tlkg hits its mark time after time. tlkg is about a woman named samantha cain (davis) who suffers from amnesia. she is married with a kid and as she qoutes "i'm a goddamn member of the pta." and then her world comes crumbling down as the pieces fall into place about her earlier identity. samuel jackson plays a con artist cop who does pi gigs, he is dragged along by her to solve her identity and to get paid some cash for his work. along the way we find out samantha is really charlie baltimore, a secret spy that was left for dead years earlier. the plot is great, making this story seem real and jackson does a great job as second fiddle to davis (whom always does a great acting job). the explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with memorable scene after memorable scene. pretty impressive visually though the kid got on my nerves at the end (watch out of the cars!) i'm tired of little kids screwing up a film to be saved but still, this movie is worth it as the kid adds to the film. again, this movie is really good, i never understood why it didn't make more at the box office but if it was a man starring in the movie i'm sure it would have grossed a hundred million. what is good is that over the years more people are discovering this movie and giving it good marks as the average of this film on this site has risen over the years. i hope it goes up further as this is one great action film. and i love action films
