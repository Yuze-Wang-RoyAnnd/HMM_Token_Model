i saw borderline several years ago on amc. i've been looking for it ever since. it was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. this movie took me somewhere like a dream and i didn't care where. i will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. i still remember the way it made me tilt my head. i remember my facial expression when i saw it. i didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but i find life is that way. it didn't bother me. the unfairness of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real. i loved the faces, the way the camera dwelt upon them. the camera gazed at the set with the unfocused eyes of a daydreamer. borderline was real to me in a way movies aren't. it was exactly the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. i love this movie. someday i will own it.
