one of the major aspects of "malenkaya vera" (called "little vera" in english) is that it was the first movie from the soviet union that featured a sex scene, albeit a short one. the title is important: vera is the russian word for "faith", identifying that punk vera (natalya negoda) has little faith in the soviet system. and as the movie shows, there's not much faith to be had in it. the opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of zhdanov, nearly a hell on earth. when vera's lover sergei (andrey sokolov) moves in with her family, it leads to some unexpected events.<br /><br />like in many russian movies, people's names describe their characters. for example, there's viktor (remember that "victor" means winner). all in all, this is a good look at the soviet union while it was collapsing - and we can see why it was collapsing. really good.
