this is a great late night movie! what i mean by that is that i truly have enjoyed playing my $3.00 vhs copy (now i have a $6.99 dvd copy!) many nights just before bedtime or if i have insomnia. there's just something about this movie that makes it fun to watch in repeated viewings. it could be the fun that basil rathbone has in "the secret weapon" wearing several disguises which fool the bad guys and holmes's assistant nigel bruce (watson) but not the housekeeper (mary gordon). it could be the espionage, code cracking and ww ii theme. it could even be the light touch which the director uses to handle the threatening situations holmes finds himself in while keeping the story moving. whatever it is, "secret weapon" is simply a pleasant and enjoyable detective story which takes us back to a time when the nazis were seeking world domination and does it with the bonus of the camaraderie between watson and holmes. whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble "save the world" themes of this movie or not (i think they are right on!), i find that they only add to the flavor and fun of this fine old adventure film that holds up to repeated viewings. i rate it a pleasant 83/100 points.
