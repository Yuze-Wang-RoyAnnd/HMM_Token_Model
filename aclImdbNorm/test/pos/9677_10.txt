when i first saw this show, i was 9, and it caught my attention right away when stewie was trying to call lois on the phone in the hotel. i laughed and kept on watching. when the episode was finished, i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. this separates itself from the simpsons and other shows on say, cartoon network because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's tv-14 for a reason. the quick film cuts after each punch line and cute, funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special. talented seth macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show. a good theme song, and a crazy family that there's always something funny, makes this my favorite cartoon along sealab 2021 and aqua teen hunger force. check it out it's funny stuff.
