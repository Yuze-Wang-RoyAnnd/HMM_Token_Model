this flick was even better then 'waiting for guffman'. the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and levy's little second-second city troupe. if one finds this movie boring or pointless, god help 'em, they just didn't get it. it is a mockumentary, something at which guest and levy have a genius for. at the end of the movie where guest's southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show, he went to israel to work on a 'caboose', or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic<br /><br />of an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it's hand, i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living. thank you mr.guest and mr.levy, and god bless you.
