i saw (unfortunately) the dubbed version on encore.<br /><br />student paula henning (franka potente who was also in the cult favorite "run lola run") stars as a serious medical student who gets into a prestigious school in germany. but she soon discovers that some students go missing and the bodies they work on in the anatomy lab are incredibly fresh...<br /><br />i was stuck seeing the dubbed version on encore. it hurt a lot (the words not matching the lips got annoying real quick) but i still liked what i saw. the acting was good, it was beautifully photographed, it wasn't too gruesome and i was never bored. even more refreshing was a likable heroine who fights back when the bad guys go after her. the (mild) nudity was, in a refreshing twist, male! a previous poster mentions benno furmann (who is excellent) showed his butt but i don't remember seeing it. regardless this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. from all i've read the original german language version is the best (i don't doubt that for one second) but the dubbed version is watchable. i give this a 7.
