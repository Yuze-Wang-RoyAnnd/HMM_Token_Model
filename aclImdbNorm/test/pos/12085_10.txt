i saw this movie so long ago, but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie ever. i cried non stop. my mother will not ever watch this movie again because its almost painful to watch. anyway, apart from that the story isn't exactly complex...ann margaret is dying and has to give away her 10(?) children. as if that isn't bad enough, it is during the depression and she has to break up the close siblings one by one. i guess this was very sad to me because i too am from a very large close knit family and could identify with each child's pain of leaving their mother and siblings.<br /><br />maybe i am a masochist but i would like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end, surprisingly, is slightly happy (so at least we could smile and sob simultaneously). it should come on tv sometime so i can see it again.
