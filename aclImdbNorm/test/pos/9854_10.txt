this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i've seen, but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i've seen period. it follows the lives of two sudanese young men, peter and santino, as they try to make their way into the american culture. peter and santino are friends at first, but they gradually drift more and more apart, as peter goes to kansas city, and santino stays in houston ("a land called houston"). santino's beauty is in his eyes. he takes people onto his back, he supports an apartment full of other sudanese, paying the rent, doing everything for other people. he is a quiet sufferer. peter looks out for himself, getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends. it seems that director megan mylan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale. peter and santino are amazing characters that move you. but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society. it is not judging. it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world, and how difficult it can be to outside people. i suggest you find this film, and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people.<br /><br />my grade: 10/10
