*spoilers ahead*<br /><br />great wrestlemanias were still a few years away. but this one was certainly good, with lots of good matches, and one great match.<br /><br />demolition was always at their best at wrestlemania. i'm glad their last wm hoorah (i refuse to include the other version) was a win over the colossal connection. i liked the gag of andre never tagging in.<br /><br />few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat mr. perfect. for some reason, brutus beefcake's feat was never recognized. or the fact that he did it pretty easily.<br /><br />the hart foundation's win over the bolsheviks was the shortest in wm history, including the 24/9 second match between king kong bundy and s.d. jones.<br /><br />i'm glad jake and dibiase got to fight at wrestlemania. this made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long.<br /><br />i expected the big bossman-akeem feud to heat up, but the bossman just clobbered him. as good as bossman was as a heel, he was just great as a face. he was always intense and obviously loved his job.<br /><br />if the warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle, he would have been a great wwf champion.<br /><br />worth a watch, especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about. and the tag team matches are all very exciting.
