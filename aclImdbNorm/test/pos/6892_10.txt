i absolutely loved this series, and was very sad to see it go. yes, it's christian based, and traditionally as well. it deals with some tough issues, as the other reviewer points out, but i guess it depends on your viewpoint on these matters, and as a teenager growing up and now as a mother myself, i was so happy to see a tv series that was clean and, well, quite frankly, wonderful! i, unlike the other reviewer, was heartened to see how they dealt with the condom deal. instead of hearing the typical wishy washiness about condoms, they showed the son actually working at being chaste and applying it to his later relationships, which were pure and godly because of it, and a lot safer because of it (100%!).<br /><br />after watching this entire series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family (once they settle down more permanently), and the moral values they teach in each episode are just priceless. i found touched by an angel (made by the same producer) to be cheesy here and there (although overall i liked it), but this series, in my opinion, was a lot better made and had better acting and was more interesting as well. it was good for the entire family and was interesting for the entire family, which was a huge plus. the family wasn't outstanding, they had their own faults, but in the long run they did what was right and you saw them grow and change and struggle like any true family does. it was my favorite show at the time and will always be near the top of my list, i hope it comes out on dvd!
