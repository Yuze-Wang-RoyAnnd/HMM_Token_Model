a gem of a cartoon from the silent era---it was re-discovered by cartoon network, and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades, if ever.<br /><br />what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos...douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos; will hays pays a visit as 'boss' of static studios; as well as appearances by chaplin, keaton, and william s. hart. the image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace (a money-making idea for felix's near-bankrupt shoe-=salesman boss) cannot be described--it must be viewed. a terrific cultural gem.
