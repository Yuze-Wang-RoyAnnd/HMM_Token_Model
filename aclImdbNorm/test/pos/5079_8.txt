i liked this movie. i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well. the director, gavin hood was supposed to be present for today's screening, but alas his twins were born just hours before, so he had to jet on a flight back. '2 birthings in 24 hours' was how he joked about it.<br /><br />rendition refers to 'extraordinary rendition' -- a term whereby suspected terrorists in the us can be sent, without the legal consent of their parents nations, to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained.<br /><br />it's fairly predictable -- innocent egyptian-american man wrongly accused of being a terrorist 'goes missing' while en route from south africa to washingon dc. he is sent abroad, while wife at home (reese witherspoon) fights to find him and free him. but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in story-telling: 1) a human-touch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bomb-detonated; 2) the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on; and 3) the chronology of story-telling which makes it a tight, taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments. ah -- relief! and a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an ending.<br /><br />all-around strong acting with meryl streep as a standout vixen.
