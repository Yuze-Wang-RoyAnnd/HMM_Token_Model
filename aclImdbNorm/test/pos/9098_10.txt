jack black and kyle gass team together to promote their band tenacious d in this rock classic called tenacious d in the pick of destiny. jack black and kyle gass invent their own rock opera..it was like an opera of rock 'n' roll. some of the most twisted events took place in that movie....the big foot part....the mushroom part....and in the end when they did the rock off against the devil. a classic formed in tenacious d....one of the best films i have seen in a long time. the last couple things i saw in the theater were stupid..but this movie rocks. this really made me laugh hard. the whole basis is jack black runs of to find his rock partner in los angeles. his partner is kyle gass and man who has always been bald. they work together to find this magic pick that can make the most terrible musician play greatly. they finally make it to the rock 'n' roll museum and steal the pick. on the way they meet the stranger played by tim robbins. they make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner grabs the pick and all along he was the devil and he battles the d in a rock off. the d doesn't win but the devil's horn falls off sending him back to hell. therefore long live the d!!!!!!!!!!
