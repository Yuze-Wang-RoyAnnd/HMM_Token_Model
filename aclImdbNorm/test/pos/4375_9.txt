mr. carlin left our common forum in june of 2008, shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest (he had a history of heart trouble). the media, and comics everywhere covered the loss more than i or he would have ever expected ... but, he was the grandfather of observational comedy.<br /><br />this recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter. filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to have attained (observed?). i have followed carlin's career from the days of fuzzy black and white television, and enjoyed his topical record albums.<br /><br />it is a privilege for any carlin fan to at least see (if not own a copy) of this particular show. he was still fast moving, and with great timing, even at 70! as he would say,,, he is not "smiling down from heaven on you". if he's doing anything at all it's not taking harp lessons; perhaps he's looking up!!!
