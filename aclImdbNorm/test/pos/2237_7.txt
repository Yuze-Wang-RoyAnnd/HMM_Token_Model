i caught this movie late night on tv, and was expecting a low-budget campy "masterpiece", i was surprised with a pretty decent movie. angelina jolie's unique acting capabilities (or should i say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.<br /><br />there is a plot; a fairly intricate plot at that, involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple (one human, one android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a "big brother"-type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix. the production and sets, also, were much better than i expected. i haven't seen the original cyborg, so i can't really compare it to much else; granted this film is no blade runner, but as a late-night, futuristic guilty pleasure, its worth a watch.
