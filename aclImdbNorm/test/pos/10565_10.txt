wow! where to start?<br /><br />this adaptation of sarah waters' third novel is one of my all-time favorite movies!!!!!<br /><br />i'm not to big on fiction novels (seriously i never read fiction), but the book is just as fabulous as the film! or should i say the film is just as fabulous as the book?! i just love this story!!!!!<br /><br />anyway, i put off watching this three hour long film (2 part series on dvd, 3 part series on tv/book) for about a year and half. it simply did not look that interesting...boy was i so wrong! <br /><br />i became immediately immersed into the rich and suspenseful plot...utterly enthralled! just like the book, you cannot stop watching/reading. it grasps your attention for the entire 3 hours...and when it does end...you wish it hadn't.<br /><br />the story just flows so beautifully and you'll be wondering where the time went.<br /><br />the lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake! the parts i love most are the subtle facial expressions and glances/eye contact between the two characters. you really feel their desire for one another and yet they cannot act upon it.....until they must. <br /><br />may i point out that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously, at the heart of the film is a genuine unexpected love story, but it is most certainly not what the whole movie is about. for me that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing. i've never read or heard of anything like it. sarah waters is pure genius!<br /><br />the twists and turns it takes leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. seriously! my hands were clasped on to my couch with every surprising plot twist and i even yelled out several times ("oh my god! no way! that did not just happen! did it?")...i never do that!<br /><br />the only negative thing i have to say about this film is that i wish they'd added more from the book. but obviously having the adaptation be restricted by time they couldn't add everything that i would've liked. how awful it is though...i think i'm just being brutally selfish now...forgive me. <br /><br />the last 20 minutes does seem a little rushed. however, they put all the important bits in where even if you only watch the film and choose not to read the book you will be most satisfied with the outcome. <br /><br />the actors are just superb! brilliant even! sally hawkins (sue) and elaine cassidy (maud) have such great on screen chemistry they steam up your television set. simply electric! the emotions...the desperation...the struggle each of them feel is expressed seemingly effortless by these wonderfully talented actresses. rupert evans plays such a good bad guy as gentleman. i found myself seething every time he came on screen, but loving it because he's just so damn cute and somehow still charming even though you want to wring his neck. imelda staunton gives yet another fantastic performance as mrs. sucksby. she's such a warmhearted actress you cannot help but love her...even when the character she's playing isn't as delightful. everyone else in the cast were perfect! they really represented the characters well and were just as i imagined them to be after reading the book.<br /><br />this is a must see for any film buff! actually, anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book! chances are you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />10/10 stars from me! there are only four other films i have given that same rating too. its very rare for me to actually enjoy a film so much that i give it 10/10. this is one of those films. fingersmith is truly a masterpiece!
