another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it's another worthy installment. my only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two, though that might be because of a glorious lack of disk-swapping. roll on mi4.
