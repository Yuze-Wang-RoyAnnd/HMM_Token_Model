if anything, william girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of the action in regards to whatever was popular during the time. i mean, a blaxploitation flick in louisville, kentucky..who would of thunk it?!?! i can just imagine the enthusiasm he must've had getting pam grier, quite a hot item, to star in his picture. if you are pretty familiar with the genre, girdler's sheba, baby doesn't necessarily stray too far from formula. despite a change of venue, the film still deals with a ruthless businessman nicknamed shark who muscles in on loan companies, using stooges to threaten them in order to get their signatures. <br /><br />grier is sheba shayne, a former louisville cop working in chicago who returns home at the request of her father's partner, brick(austin stoker, assault on precinct 13). sheba's father, despite shark's bullying tactics(..his man in town is pilot, a wannabe gangster, equipped with stooges who aren't that menacing, rather buffoonish in nature, so thin-skinned they hire hit men outside of town to shoot up the shayne loan building), won't give up his company, and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force, leads to his being killed. sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death. in other words, shark's ass is grass..can you dig it? <br /><br />seeing grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular film, the novelty of the setting being in louisville is part of the package. you even get to see a speedboat chase, grier in shootouts with gangsters(..not necessarily the most polished kind one might be accustomed to seeing in a chicago or new york during this period in blaxploitation), lots of blood spurting from bullet-riddled bodies torn apart by gun-fire, and colorful characters(..such as a wimpy loan shark in pimp-dress named walker and pilot who is one of the least scary mobsters you are likely to see)who show up during the film, most having the misfortune of coming in contact with a very angry sheba. the plot itself is nothing special, but grier is always worth watching, and girdler orchestrates plenty of action sequences to keep his target audience entertained. a modest success for girdler, and one of his more accomplished films.
