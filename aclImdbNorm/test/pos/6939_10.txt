governments are elected for three year terms, as reg whithers said in 1973, the liberals were determined to continue forcing labor to the polls until they were defeated. if you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but, anyone who says kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self-serving and costly strategy of the liberal party of australia. on the series itself, i though max phipps was a poor whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. also, more of the key political players on both sides should have been used, though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at the time. nevertheless, i recommend it, with caution.
