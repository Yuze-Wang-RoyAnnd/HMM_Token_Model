teen deviyaan is a great film. a very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. the music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of majrooh are meaningless at places. dev anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role. kalpana is sexy and nanda is ok. simi too is just about ok. the film has terrific dialogue by vrajendra gaur who wrote most of dev anand's films like mahal, duniya, warrant, jaali note, manzil, etc.etc.<br /><br />it is a story of dev getting attracted to three females - the mod kalpana, simi and the homely nanda. he eventually opts for nanda. the story is about ok but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and songs and the great dev anand are the highlight of the film. a must watch film for all dev anand fans.
