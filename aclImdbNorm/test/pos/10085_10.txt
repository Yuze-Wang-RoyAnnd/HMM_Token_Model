this is one of the best movies i have ever seen...<br /><br />it's so full of details and every time you see it you'll find new things... like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice, and when the girls flute, they can't do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls, and there aren't. <br /><br />i have some problem finding out, about in the middle of the movie their "uncle" visit them, but why does his wife freak out?!? else a fantastic movie.!!! the best asian movie ever.<br /><br />i hope people will enjoy it. there have been so many movie, where the main character is skit-so (the machinist, secret window and so on), but this movie is way better than them!!!
