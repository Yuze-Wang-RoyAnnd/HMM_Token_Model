the gymnast (2006) was written and directed by ned farr. dreya weber portrays jane hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist.<br /><br />the promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. although this meeting takes place, that plot line is secondary to the main plot, which involves jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named serena (addie yungmee). the two women develop an act of the type performed by cirque de soleil. the two complement each other--jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength. serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats.<br /><br />the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to addie, who is caring and compassionate, while jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage.<br /><br />both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. they clearly are truly performing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed, be a success in las vegas, or anywhere else they traveled.<br /><br />the sexual tension between the women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. a woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation, which isn't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion.<br /><br />of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival, we thought this one was the best. it will work on dvd, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. note: stay for the credits!
