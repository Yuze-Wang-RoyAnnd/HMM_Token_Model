i recently purchased lost horizon on ebay, having vivid memories of the things i will not miss number from childhood (i am an ancient 29). i also recently finished the novel upon which it is based. i was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure. a wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by james hilton). sally kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic sally hughes, who gradually warms to the charms of shangri-la. only liv ullmann flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher (a role far more suited to a julie andrews type. the fact that finch, ullmann and hussey are all dubbed isn't important as it is almost impossible to tell. the songs do vary in quality, the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper dvd release and a lot more recognition.
