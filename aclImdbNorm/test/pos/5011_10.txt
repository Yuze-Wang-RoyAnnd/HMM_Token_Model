i saw the movie at the nashville film festival on may 1, 2003! it was amazing! all the things that i had read about stuey were portrayed incredibly well by tony vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), michael imperioli (incredible job as stuey), and all the others involved in this. i'm glad he (vidmer) didn't go down the "leaving las vegas" routine with stuey's bad habits, but instead put us inside his life, family, and his gift. tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screenwriting skill. a big "thumbs up" on this one!
