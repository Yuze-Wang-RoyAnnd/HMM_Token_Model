it'll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released....still makes me laugh.... if u enjoy this film, try the new hera pheri....t'is as hilarious. and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point...and he actually says it out loud!!! u just wanna bash him....but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing!!!! fantastic film.... 10/10
