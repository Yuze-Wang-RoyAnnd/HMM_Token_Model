i have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. i really can't come up with one. i think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.there are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than usa t.m., i'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. this dvd, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't. it is philosophical, maybe, but it bypasses the information mode and goes directly to the same place that a piece of music does. it makes you feel but sometimes you don't even know why. you are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling. when you watch it, notice how well it is put together. it may not be for everyone but it is for everyone who look for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.
