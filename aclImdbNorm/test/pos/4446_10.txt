don't torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo diversion for lucio fulci. unlike other subgenre heavyweights like mario bava and dario argento, fulci takes a decidedly gritty, grounded, and socially perceptive approach to the giallo narrative in this film. there is nothing glamorous about the child murders and borderline pedophilia (a gutsy subplot for 1972) going on here, and fulci wisely shoots with a staid and lugubrious eye, avoiding flash, melodrama, and directorial histrionics. the proceedings are punctuated by gory and instantly mind-searing set pieces that are bolstered even further by fulci's jarring sense of realism
