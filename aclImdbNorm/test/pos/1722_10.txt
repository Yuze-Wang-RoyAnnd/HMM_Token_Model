i love dr who so much! i believe that david tennant is the best dr the show has ever had and billie piper the best companion! i liked the way the dr and rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose! it sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons. i will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without rose! but david is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role! i rate this show 110% it is fantastic! the graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love, the world and relationships from this show. therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!
