i enjoyed this film very much. it effectively combines humor, fantasy, and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from higuchinsky. brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning spirals. my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasn't as daring as it could have been. still, i give this a solid 8 out of 10. the u.s. should take note of this and other fine japanese horror/fantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd. actually, asian cinema in general, have some of the finest films that have been unnoticed by the american public because they're hard to find. i strongly recommend people to go look for these treasures, they're hard to find, but once you find them, you'll be glad you did.
