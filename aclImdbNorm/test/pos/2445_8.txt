the outsiders is undoubtedly a classic australian tv series. well defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting locales, great guest stars and a filmic ambiance all combined to make this series a special one.<br /><br />sadly, andrew keir has passed on & sascha hehn from germany does not appear (unfortunately) to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country. the abc has repeated the series many times yet a dvd release is yet to happen.<br /><br />the series is one which is timeless. it is as likely to strike a resonant chord with viewers today as it did in its own day. come on abc...release the outsiders on dvd!!!!!
