i was amazed at the quality of this film, particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - all 140(?) lbs of him! truly, a boy directing a movie about a boy. i look forward to seeing more luke eberl films.<br /><br />i did think this one was a bit too long. there was too much time spent showing connor being unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on owen. caleb didn't try hard enough. owen, being so young, could have easily become closer to caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference. and owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" about corruption and politics. instead, he didn't give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality. and what about poor caleb? owen could have been a good influence.<br /><br />though the film intends to show owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption, i felt sad for owen. he was offered the opportunity to have some boy-boy fun with caleb, who was extraordinarily beautiful. owen didn't have to go along with the political perversion as offered. but he could have tried to have some fun with caleb, and still walked away when he wanted. it was clear that owen was in charge - no one forced him to do anything he didn't want to do. but he could have had more fun, and with a very hot boyfriend, at that.<br /><br />i hope luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun.
