i just saw this film in austin texas at the austin gay and lesbian film festival and it was my festival favorite. the gymnast is a film not to be missed. it is an honest "coming to terms" story about relationships, self discovery , growing older and having the courage to change and move forward. not only is this a good story but the glorious aerialist performances by dreya weber and addie yungmee will take your breath away! see this film! it will be coming soon to a festival near you. this film deserved to be picked up right away by a major network or studio. i will certainly purchase this when it becomes available on dvd.
