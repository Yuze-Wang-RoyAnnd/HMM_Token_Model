once i knew that donald sutherland, (jack shaw/henry fields) was appearing in this film it instantly told me this was going to be a good picture to view. most of sutherland's pictures are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind. in this picture, jack shaw did his very best to be a good guy and a bad guy while he was training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a different person over night. there is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which i would not want to perform. this naval officer lived in a quite community with his wife and was a father, but you would never realize that fact until the film reveals his horrible background secrets which he had to keep from his family and friends. good spy film and great acting by all the actors.
