i gave this show a chance because of jaleel white, not for his urkel character, but mainly for the sonic the hedgehog voice xd so anyway, like i said, i gave it a chance, and i was very fond of it. i never cared for the urkel character, so i was pleased to see mr. white in a role other than the ever-so-annoying nerd. and his calvin j. fraiser (first called calvin, but come the second episode, everyone started calling him "j") was very entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />i think my favorite episode was when j was dating the ex-cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid. ("don't you talk that way 'bout my momma!" "this is grown-up talk, you stay down there!") the only beef i have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters, but mr. white's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always had the back stories... it isn't exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to j. having to babysit his girlfriend's dog.....<br /><br />other than that, i really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. unfortunetely, it seems that people weren't interested in jaleel white as something other than the god-awful annoying ass nerd known as urkel....<br /><br />hope they at least put it out as a dvd box set.
