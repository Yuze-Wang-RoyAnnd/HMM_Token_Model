i watched this show until my puberty but still i found it to reflex many situations that worry us when we're teenagers although it was a family oriented show. until the mid 90's it focused more on the young adults and their situations.<br /><br />that's why i loved "step by step". i mean, it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of it's kind, it delivered expectations.<br /><br />let's be honest; this wasn't an extremely funny show, no, but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnier.<br /><br />there was an extremely good charm between patrick duffy and susan sommers. duffy rocked! sommers was tender and actually funny. i was in love with stacy keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved her legs) and witty. but sasha mitchell stole the show with his cody character. he was the man back in the day! oh, the memories. nowadays, this show wasn't been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and that's why it should be kept in the vault of memories. that's it, only memories.<br /><br />thank you step by step for making my puberty funnier.
