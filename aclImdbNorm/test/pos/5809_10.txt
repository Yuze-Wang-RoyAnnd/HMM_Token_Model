years ago, with "ray of light," madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry, and since then she's occasionally transcended even her own standards. this concert production, with its hypnotic editing, amazing dancing, hallucinatory lighting effects, and trance-inducing arrangements, blows away all previous efforts. madonna's apparent ambition -- to single-handedly bring about world peace through music and dance -- may seem hubristic or absurd to some. but hell, somebody's got to do it! thanks to her assemblage of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, "confessions tour live from london" places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium.
