from today's point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 (or x in the us). the film has a sexual, yet sublime erotic story to tell, but the pictures are rather innocent. throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in the fashion, the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting. and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.
