i can't say what knowing the source for this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite films from paul mazursky (director and co-author). this is a retake on the shakespeare "comedy", but utterly removed from the stage. without much text, mazursky and star cassavettes make visual a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. desperate to re-center himself, cassavettes retreats to a remote greek island--where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. with raul julia especially, susan sarandon and molly ringwald, this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous. and funny. it wasn't a big box office hit, but whenever it does come to dvd, it will sell.
