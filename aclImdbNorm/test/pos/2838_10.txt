after a summer full of retreads and disappointments, nurse betty is a breath of fresh air. the film is like no other i have ever seen. director neil labute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant in the company of men, and the almost brillant your friends and neighbors). renee zellweger gives the best performance of her career as betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (labute mainstay aaron eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world. morgan freeman and chris rock play the hitmen who killed her husband and are now on her trial. the trick to the film is that freeman and zellweger are really parallel characters. while zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite dr. dave ravell on a soap opera, freeman idealizes betty. nurse betty is a brillant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. my grade: 10/10.
