alter egos do not come funnier than the creation of sacha baron cohen's ali g. completely misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the middle england suburban surroundings that his social background consists of. he persists on living the style of a los angeles gansta. while still living with his gran in the london suburb of staines, he keeps tight control of his posse, the west staines "massiv".<br /><br />spending his spare time between me julie, his girl, the posse and teaching local eight year old scouts at "keep it real (advanced)" lessons at the government funded john nike leisure centre.<br /><br />this is where the story takes off, being told that the government funding has stopped, ali g then proceeds on a one-man quest "in the struggle for justice i iz willing to lay down me life, just like martin luther van dross did". being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence.<br /><br />charles dance here plays david carlton, the sinister and devious deputy prime minster, who is "even more eviller than skeletor". using ali g, unknowingly, to lose the prime minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. seeing ali g as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires. ali g suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people, working directly with the prime minster. the story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences.<br /><br />ali g indahouse is a great british movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing, along with dan mazer, executive production and acting of sacha baron cohen. charles dance and michael gambon, as the p.m. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is ali g.<br /><br />ironically, seeing the parodies playing their parts in a world that really is real, and who are continually preaching "keep it real" from their own little world that is the west staines "massiv" is true comic paradox.<br /><br />directed by mark mylod, his first full length feature film since directing television work such as shameless, shooting stars, the fast show and the smell of reeves and mortimer to name a few.<br /><br />very real and very funny.
