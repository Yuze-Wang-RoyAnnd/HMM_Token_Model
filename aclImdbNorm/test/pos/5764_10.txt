it may not be oscar material, however this was a very funny film. i was always a fan of eddie (edmondson) & richie (mayall). "bottom" & "young ones" were legendary tv series', and it was about time they made a film. some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant, from the pencil is the rear-end, to the rubber sex-pants, as well was the infamous line that richie says when he falls and a candle he is carrying goes into his eye. he says to eddie "candle in the eye, candle in the eye", and eddie been the simpleton that he is, sticks the candle he's carrying into his eye. can't forget when eddie is on his motorbike, and he needs to urinate.... it was a great comedy, not to be taken seriously at all, but the film lacked with an ridicilous ending.<br /><br /> overall, a exellent comedy, full of laughs, and lots of fake green vomit. a 9/10.<br /><br />
