yes, indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie!<br /><br />the only reason i chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad-made that it actually becomes funny.<br /><br />"night hunter" is basically about jack cutter, a vampire hunter (vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, being that he has to kill the last remaining vampires.<br /><br />this movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes i have ever seen in my life. not to mention the really bad gun-shooting scenes. when people are shot in this movie, blood splatters- thick as ketchup all over the place, this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest. a constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fight-scenes. this is, i suppose, done to create an "action-effect", though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever. its completely ridiculous! <br /><br />all stunt-scenes are done extremely badly. e.g a scene where the dead vampire-leader gets thrown off a roof. when the corpse hits the ground, it bounces like a wobbly rubber-doll. a scene where jack sniffs the ground, getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically.<br /><br />lame music, cheesy scenes, bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction. to state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans. clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action-movies, haven't seen many in your life.<br /><br />this is basically a b-class vampire-action-movie that deserves 0/10 but which i'll give 10/10, just for its ability (being the lousiest action-movie i have ever seen)of making me laugh and because i just can't live without it.
