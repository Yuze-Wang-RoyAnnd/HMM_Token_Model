i recently read the story to see how these two match up, and if you can believe it, this film improves upon balzac. the story is moved around, i think, to drive home the idea that colonel chabert is a man who has suffered much and yet he comes home, not a hero, but as an outcast.<br /><br />as someone mentioned, i was initially confused if chabert was akin to the return of martin guerre. no. it is firmly established by balzac that chabert is the real deal. what's interesting, though, is not is he, isn't he, but how his wife, and society, treats him.<br /><br />i think this is a timeless story of men who go off to fight for their country and when they come home time has left them behind. chabert is a tragic figure made all the more poignant by the amazing gerard depardieu. i don't care that he's been in 1 million films, he's captivating.<br /><br />fanny ardant has a horrible character to play. once a prostitute, rose has used her feminine wiles to climb the social ladder. are her emotions true for compte ferraud? i think they are and perhaps couple that with her social standing at the time, and you start to feel some empathy for her.<br /><br />fabrice lucini is slowly worming his way into my heart. he's exceptional here as derville.<br /><br />i think if you can get your hands on this gem of a film, you won't be sorry. french cinema at its finest.
