you got to see it to believe it. shot in hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy, anything goes 70s, this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day. then again, i bet it had a one week run. actually, its pretty hilarious. the acting is dreadful, the direction non existent, but the hair, clothes, rotten pre disco music and the general out and out sleaziness of the story are mind boggling. sleazy, its very sleazy. highly recomended (if you can find it)
