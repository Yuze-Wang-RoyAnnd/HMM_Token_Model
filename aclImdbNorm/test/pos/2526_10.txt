pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality. and yet i more than imagine hector babenco owes some of his film-making chops with this film to vittorio de sica's neo-realist style, in particular shoeshine (that film, as with pixote, takes place mostly inside a children's prison). and yet while i might still prefer de sica's film if it came down to deciding between the two it's so close because it is, no pun intended, like choosing between two children. they're both marvelous works of raw drama, and with pixote babenco has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isn't filmed in conditions brought on after a world war. this is how it was in brazil- one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in city of god, perhaps in some of the same locations- and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made. some aren't alive some 20+ years later, for all anyone knows.<br /><br />the "star", pre-teen street kid fernando ramos da silva, plays the title character, a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him, and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys. the conditions couldn't be much worse, and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty. there's a riot, and an escape, and halfway through the film we find pixote with a few other youths, including lilica a practical transvestite not even 18, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, whatever to get by. none of this, i should repeat, is shown with a kind of ham-fisted earnestness- certainly you would never in a million years see ron howard or paul haggis direct this kind of picture- and yet there's an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is trivialized.<br /><br />nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for pixote, and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn, and so without even reaching puberty yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older (though not by much at all) and become things that will haunt this person forever. despite babenco's usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing feels forced. as with de sica, maybe more-so given the consistent conditions of san paolo and rio street kids, he's a natural director of children, and coax's out of ramos da silva and jorge juli~ao and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of "cinematic" drama (that is not so real that it becomes documentary, which isn't a bad thing per-say) and even subtlety in some scenes.<br /><br />pixote may not be as well known as it's later 21st century brazilian films that look back on the horrors of rio, or even neo-realist films, but it should be. anyone wanting to get a good, hard glimpse at what it was like should seek it out at a library or other and soak in what is the best foreign film of 1981.
