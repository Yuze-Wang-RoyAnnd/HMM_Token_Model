a terrific, fast-paced screwball-like comic strip/drama/farce set against france's 1939 implosion. played with wide-eyed, straight-faced intensity by a talented cast and chockablock with action, satire, social commentary and authentic period details, from slick brillantined hairdos and marcelled hairdos to a fleet of citroen "tractions," a rollicking soundtrack and brief but credible impersonations of charles de gaulle and marshal petain. <br /><br />it's simply some of the best entertainment recently shown on screen, devoid of presumption and "message." if movies were trains (and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam-driven train that works despite there being no steam locomotive --an expensive prop, no doubt) this would be a tgv.
