i just started watching the show around july. i found it by mistake, i was channel surfing during a vacation. it is a great show, i just wish it wasn't on so late at night. it's on at 12:30 am. as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.<br /><br />i read some comments. i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.<br /><br />i grew up in the 60's. i'm hispanic and i had a "white" boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school. i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color.<br /><br />i can't wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it. this way i can see it from the beginning.
