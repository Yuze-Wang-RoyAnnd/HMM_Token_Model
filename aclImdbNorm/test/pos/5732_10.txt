my local pbs station whyy philadelphia recently showed "the elegant universe." after three hours of watching it, besides having my brain hurt, i learned all about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternate universes.<br /><br />the last hour of the show was about "string theory" physics, a semi-new branch of physics which makes many of the the ideas of science fiction not only possible, but probable. with the "string theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines are possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them.<br /><br />although it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic, i found the show very interesting and informative. it was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject.
