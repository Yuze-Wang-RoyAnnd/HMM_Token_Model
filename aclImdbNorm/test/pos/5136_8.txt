i highly recommend this movie to everyone. my son and i read the book first and then saw the movie. while the book was better (in my opinion) the movie was still great. my son and i agree that while we like the book version the best, we liked the ending of the movie better than the book ending. the scenery is just tremendous and the soundtrack is a must have. the fact that jimmy buffett has a small role and provides music is an added plus. luke wilson does a decent job in his role of officer delinko and is pretty much what i had mentally imagined delinko would look like when i read the book. i'm surprised that this didn't do better in the theaters, and i'll be waiting for the dvd to come out.
