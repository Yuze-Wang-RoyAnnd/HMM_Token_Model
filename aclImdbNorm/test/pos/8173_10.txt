i have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and heartwarming film. i think that the effort of the film's director/writer is courageous as well as inspirational. i loved this film not only for the fantastic story (which needed to be told), but also for the way the actors delivered the story. this is not another shallow "gay movie" that depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations. this was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love truly knows no bounds, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. <br /><br />another thing that touched my heart was how well i could relate to the emotion portrayed in this film surrounding the coming out of one of the main characters. we all have to go through similar situations living in the society that we live in and feeling that feeling of detachment from everything that is "right" and "normal". i give my most heartfelt praise for this fabulous and courageous story.
