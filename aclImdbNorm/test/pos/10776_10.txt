this is a film about passion. the passion it depicts is largely misdirected, even for the leading man. but therein lies the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by nonsense, and can even lead us to do things that are destructive -- to ourselves or others. moreover, those who try to escape from acquiring passion (watch the druggie who visits the studio) also risk self-destruction.<br /><br />the world needs to hear the message of this movie more often.
