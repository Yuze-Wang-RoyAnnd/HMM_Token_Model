never posted anything here before, but after watching noroi i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it.<br /><br />firstly do not compare this to blair witch, this movie deserves far better than that! simply put, noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies i have ever seen (and i have seen a lot!).<br /><br />i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (i think?) named kobayashi and his cameraman. without spoiling to much about the plot, i can say it that it starts with kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events, that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister.<br /><br />while the story might not be that original in itself, what really hooked me with noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere. if you're looking for cheap scares and seat-jumping scenes this movie might not be for you. this movie is all about the mood it presents, with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense. the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable.<br /><br />this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the movie! far better than in most other movies in this type of genre.<br /><br />well enough ranting from me, i highly recommend noroi to everyone, it is suspenseful, creepy, well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages.
