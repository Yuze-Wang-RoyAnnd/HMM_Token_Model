i must have seen this on the television when it was first broadcast some decades ago. i thought it was brilliant then, and as i remember so much of it now i may have been right. while i have lived in and around london i cannot call myself a londoner and do not know it at all well - who does other than taxi drivers? once the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearn-able and rise to the status of demigods, then the rest is sheer joy. the characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally diverse, and so differently affected by the events of the film. don't think this is a documentary - it is pure drama, and the knowledge is one of the characters. i have never seen anything like this film, before or since. watch it!
