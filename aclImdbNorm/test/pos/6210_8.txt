the story of tom garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend henry. henry and his wife debate whether tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel. the film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and i highly recommend it.<br /><br />tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad, dominating his board of directors and his competition, terrorizing his employees, slaughtering strikers. tom's ambitious wife sally was responsible for all of tom's success. when he met her, he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad. sally teaches him to read and takes over his trackwalker job while tom goes to school. he starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president.<br /><br />but as tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to sally gradually falls to pieces. his spoiled son despises him, and he takes up with a much younger woman (the aptly named eve), with predictably catastrophic consequences. in his business life, tom is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. much like the hearst figure in "citizen kane," tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system.<br /><br />spencer tracy is terrific in the role of tom garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity. colleen moore is also excellent as sally; both of them age beautifully in the multi-generational story. the film was written by preston sturges, but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which sturges became famous.
