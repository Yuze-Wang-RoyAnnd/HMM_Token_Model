although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out, this is a total lie. in fact, apart from the opening segment, the film isn't even a horror movie. with its sunken treasure, legions of fish people, and mad scientists, it's a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie. obviously, this film is no work of art, but it's kind of fun to watch... just be warned that the beginning is quite gory.
