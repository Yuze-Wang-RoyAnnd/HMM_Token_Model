we saw la spettatrice at the syracuse international film & video festival & liked it.<br /><br />this film delved into the fear we all have. fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.<br /><br />the three lead actors, barbora bobulova as valeria, brigitte catillon as flavia, andrea renzi as massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. it was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.<br /><br />i believe barbora bobulova is a stand out. i hope we see much more of her in the coming years.<br /><br />this film doesn't take the easy way out. thumbs up to the italian team who put this film together. highly recommended.
