this movie is definitely one of the finest of its kind,. a victrion age story of love, and, grit. the depth of its story line is one that will stir the inner most emotions of love, and hate, with some very interesting twists, this is a must have movie for not only the lesbian audiences, but, for all viewers. i can't say much more or i will spoil the experience for a new, young audience who might just be coming out. another fine work for sarah waters. it also is a great way for sally hawkins to win over audiences who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another sarah waters work, in "tipping the velvet".. it is also a must see..
