another popular screening for a british picture at coalville's century theatre. a well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! a masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director julian fellowes. outstanding performance, as usual, by tom wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors linda bassett and john neville. our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'. a good tight production at around only 80 minutes, probably produced on a very limited budget, but a success, which should see fellowes directing again for the big screen. some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s (as per nigel balchin's novel)but obviously this is not the case. recommended viewing.
