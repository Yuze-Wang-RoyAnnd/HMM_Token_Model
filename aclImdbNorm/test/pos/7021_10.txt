dirty dancing one of my most favorite movies. i've only watched it two times on abc because i haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from blockbuster. i had no idea jennifer grey was 27 at the time she made the movie, because she was very convincing as a teenager. compared to some women in hollywood she has a very flat chest, which is why i was fooled so easily about her age. so both physically and emotionally, grey pulls off playing a teen very well. i also loved the dancing--who wouldn't? both times i've watched dirty dancing, i keep wanting to look up dance classes. i also love the soundtrack, and i do recognize some of the songs from when i was eight or nine. i would love to be able to watch this in my drama class, and i'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes. it's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year. and the ending was absolutely fantastic. that's one of the best moments in the film.<br /><br />i can't believe i'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of dirty dancing! who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title?
