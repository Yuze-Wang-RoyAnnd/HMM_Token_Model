words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie (and the sequels)... does it have flaws? sure it does... starting with the "subspecies" themselves,which were not executed well enough for a special effect.so why do i glorify these movies??? for the herd of movie mass-consumers out there,who care more about quantity than quality,about cheap fun more than about depth, crap like "blade" (it doesn't even deserve a capital letter),"underworld","dracula 2000","dracula 3000" and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes... what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic,on the other hand,is obvious: the vampire himself is romanian,the story is set in transylvania (the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing),and the atmosphere is not based on any "action-packed" chases or expensive orchestral music.radu himself is the source of the atmosphere... this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave! add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romania,include some typical vampiric elements ( such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight) and you have a work of art! in short,if ,like me,you 're fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark,there's no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie... or in vampire journals,the brilliant spin off of the former...
