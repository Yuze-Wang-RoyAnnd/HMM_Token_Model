ok,so this film is not very well known,and wasn't very well publicised.i discovered this fairly brutal gangster gone good movie by complete accident on one of skys millions of movie channels late on some boring evening,but i'm glad i did!the opening sequence to this film is fantastically comical in a very dark way.this in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie.i think a lot of critics and movie fans that have actually seen this film have been a bit unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the reservoir dogs vein.ok,so there are undeniable similarities between thursday and some other crime genre films that it has been compared to,but in all fairness,i think this film takes a much more darkly comic look at this type of film,and the end result is a engrossing,well made,funny,if not totally original film.tom jane is good in this,and deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the the punisher.his performance as the bad guy gone good is realistic,funny and just cold enough to make you believe casey really was a bad ass before he reformed.thats another thing that makes this film stand out for me,the characters.in nicks gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled,a smooth,charismatic but very cold leader(nick),a trigger happy blood loving sexually predatory bitch of a woman(dallas)and a psychotic hill billy with brains with a penchant for torture(billy hill).throw in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on screen,beautifully over played by mickey rourke,and you've got a recipe for...well for thursday really.its at times darkly comic,sometimes brutal,sometimes unoriginal,but always engrossing and worth watching.8/10
