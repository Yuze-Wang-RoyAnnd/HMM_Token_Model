1 let's suspend belief for a moment and let's stop pretending we could, might or ought know "how it is" or "ought to be" there in space. human knowledge in that area is probably primitive as say middle ages maps are compared to today's satellite maps, so we really have no clue. 2 considering this is "just" a bbc tv docu-simulation, it gets much better than many big budget hollywood blockbusters, and that is just incredible. 3 all in all, a show worth watching as it portrays the cgi enhanced and fictionalized account of what we know of the solar system this far. 4 probably fictionalizing and cgi-ing the whole thing is the only way to make it palatable to a large public. ever watched clips from real space missions and real space probes? the quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x-ray (and what it tells about the human body ) and compare it with a cgi-ed cyborg movie...which one would be most entertaining? yet the chest x-ray is real, while the cyborg flick is just fictionalized sfx. 5 actors do a good job. none i'll tell my grandchildren about, but very fair for it being a bbc docu-simulation.
