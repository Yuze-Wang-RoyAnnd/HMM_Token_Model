young warriors (1983) <br /><br />while this is a deeply flawed (and in some ways idiotic) movie, the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fan.<br /><br />meet yuppie college student kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies. in what starts out as a particularly egregious teen sex comedy, we follow this bunch of jerk-offs and their antics, which involve, among other things, making pledges tie bricks to their genitals. the movie abruptly shifts gears when kevin's high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of bikers who apparently have nothing better to do. when she dies in the hospital, kevin vows revenge, much to the chagrin of his detective father.<br /><br />so far, we've gone from porky's-lite, through last house on the left territory, into what is apparently shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick. however, kevin and his gang's portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become kill-crazed lunatics. it's to the film's credit that it doesn't glamorize the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that kevin continually spouts, while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he does.<br /><br />the mood goes from lighthearted to grimy and downbeat very quickly, and by the end it's so over the top and exploitative that it'll leave you incredulous. and that's the strength of this film. you never know what to expect next.<br /><br />at over 100 minutes, it's a little lengthy for this kind of fare, but you won't get bored. poorly acted for the most part, with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue, this won't be topping anyone's list of forgotten classics anytime soon. i got a kick out of it though, and i'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're up for it.
