it's initial premise is based on the american civil war but it's ultimately a love story. we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (kidman & law) are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. the main thrust of this film is for law's character to return to kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns. the reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before law's character leaves for battle - it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact. everything else is just about fine, renee zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters. sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great. an honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless.
