bonny hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut. minnie driver and david duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry. sure the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film. carroll o'conner does a great job as grace's grandfather. other great character actors play his card buddies. jim belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of megan, part of the extended family.<br /><br />faith, family, and marriage are respected. a few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor.<br /><br /> and in the background that wonderful dean martin tune--"return to me."<br /><br />recommended.
