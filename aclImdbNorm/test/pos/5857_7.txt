i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening. i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller.<br /><br />what we have is like "compulsion" meets "matlock". two teens decide to commit a perfect murder. a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found. then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander. (innocent of the murder anyway)<br /><br />enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer. (imdb says that she's fbi, but i don't remember that. i thought that she was a regular cop) she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile ("the profile doesn't fit the profile!") and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys.<br /><br />she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop. but this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. all others are pretty flat.<br /><br />for a thriller, there are really no big thrills. it's mostly a cat-and-mouse game like an episode of "matlock" (which she's watching at one point in the film). the twist is that there are two involved in the killing. just who is the real murderer, justin or richard? it'll cost you eight bucks to find out.
