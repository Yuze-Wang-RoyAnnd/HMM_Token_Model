it has past almost 25 years since i saw this movie. i would consider this film as an all time classic in a drama category. anthony queen gives one of the most wonderful performances ever. in a matter of minutes he takes you from laugh to tears. this movie represents a splendid picture of how humanity changed after the ii world war. how a great part of that generation and the forthcoming lost its innocence. it has taken me long time to find this film by its name "the 25th hour". this type of films are not a moneymakers but they are for sure a treasure for some. i am very surprise why this movie is not used for the media in a broaden way in order for more people to enjoy this picture.
