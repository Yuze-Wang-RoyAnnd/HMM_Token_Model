i have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since i've seen it.<br /><br />don't get me wrong - i have long forgotten the main story line - the relationship between kidman and law, that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me. i cried for about two hours straight after wards. <br /><br />it had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. we see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with natalie portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. i was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. however, i am glad i watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own. <br /><br />the blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since i saw the film. his horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. at one point i wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that i'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least). <br /><br />i recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield.
