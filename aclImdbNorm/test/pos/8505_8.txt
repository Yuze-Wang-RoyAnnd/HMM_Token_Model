i first saw this one when it was first shown, so i'm not too objective about it. it really managed to scare me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story (the same thing that helped dark shadows itself). and the casting was so right. i hardly know shane briant from anything else, so it might not be so right to call him "well-cast," but to me, he is dorian gray. and as far as the other male actors, the one who fit his part so well was nigel davenport (who's so good at "larger than life" characters) as sir henry. and john karlen, a sort of dan curtis "repertory player" at the time, because of dark shadows. as one poster points out, this version manages to include the involvements with men, in a fairly subtle way. the scene where dorian recites a list of men's names to john karlen's character, as a way of blackmailing him, and the look on karlen's face, were very well-done. (if that scene were done now, it would probably be done in a too obvious way, and be bad by comparison.) i saw it when "dorian gray" was barely a name to me, let alone more, so even more than the famous 1945 version (which is rightly famous), this is the version to me.
