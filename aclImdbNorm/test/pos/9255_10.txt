for all the homicide junkies out there, this movie was great! every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie. it helped to resolve some (but not all) issues from the series. unfortunately, unless you actually did watch the series, most of the enjoyment would be lost, as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence. this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie, but we gotta take what we can get. i hope they make more movies, and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order.
