i'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy,i've been waiting for it on dvd. i've got it on vhs and got so fed up waiting for a release and worrying that my vhs copy would ruin i got the equipment to get it onto dvd. the picture and sound are excellent to my utter surprise. if anyone else want's a copy drop me a line at<br /><br />stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /><br />and for lb7.00 i'll put it onto a dvd,print the dvd and get it in the post to you. lb7.00 just covers my costs & recorded delivery etc with maybe a little over so i'm not after making money out of it,i'd just like the world to see this ignored gem of a comedy.i recently saw a copy of ebay got for over lb26,amazing. how can they not release this classic. email me for payment details like cheque or paypal etc etc
