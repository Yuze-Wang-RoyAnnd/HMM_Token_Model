i have been a "huge" rush fan ever since "moving pictures" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular. they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. a real example of this is during "yyz" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. they really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful "lust" that rarely happens anymore. you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given. the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life. this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection. their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music. this dvd is worth it!
