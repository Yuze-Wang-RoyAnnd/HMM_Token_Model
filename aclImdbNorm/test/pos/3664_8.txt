have you ever wondered what its like to feel free? i am sure that each one of us know the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage. hari om shows the audience what freedom actually means. in this film freedom is described in the form of style represented by isa's discovery of india. isa discovers her inner true love when she is in a rickshaw journey with mr. hari om. she looks at life differently and portrays freedom that every woman restricts in herself when she is in a relationship.<br /><br />this film is definitely "worth a watch", and i saw this the first time in dubai international film festival (diff), and i left the cinema hall with complete satisfaction.<br /><br />"watch it"!
