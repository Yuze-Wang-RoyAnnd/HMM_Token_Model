exciting, action-packed, and interesting film telling the tale of a group of men stationed at a naval base in italy and their adventures aboard a navy submarine during wwi. tommy and brick (played by robert montgomery and robert young) are two pals, and make for a couple of very handsome officers, i must say. a new captain arrives on-board, already known by a few as "dead pan" toler (walter huston) and he's a real stickler for following the rule book and a "code of honor". soon tommy and brick are chasing after an attractive blonde at an officer's dance, tommy insults the captain - and, of course, the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. but tommy wins out anyway as he and the daughter sneak away from the dance to a street carnival outside, and soon bond during an air raid - unfortunately for him, she reveals she is married. later tommy gets himself into some real trouble when he disobeys orders in an effort save his buddy.<br /><br />this film is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that held my interest and top-notch performances by all. a climactic death scene featuring sterling holloway is haunting indeed - the most memorable scene in this film, i thought. eugene palette and jimmy durante add some humor here playing a couple of goofballs - durante's character is actually studying to be a dentist via mail-order and continually has onshore run-ins with a british man who makes fun of his nose. okay - if you're looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo, this would be the one.
