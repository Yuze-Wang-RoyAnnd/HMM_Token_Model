honestly, i don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. it embraces the elements of the original, while expanding on them. the storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit "fast", that is a good thing.<br /><br />christopher eccleston is perfect in the role. easily as good as tom baker.<br /><br />rose is one of the best companions, on par with sarah jane smith or leela.<br /><br />i like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - no more politicking with the doctor acting as president emeritus. and it adds something to the character to be the only one left.<br /><br />the sfx are outstanding - especially in comparison to the original.<br /><br />take it from me (and i was a huge dr who geek - i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8. i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon, personally) this is the best sci fi show on tv right now, possibly ever. watch it and buy the dvd.
