it's not a movie, but an experience!<br /><br />not the usual eye candy i thought it would be. too many things are happening at once, your senses almost couldn't handle it. a product of cutting-edge technology (we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3d glasses on and off to decipher the magic), the music is great (it's a concert!), the disney characters are in it (and you get to be part of their world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting--i know this is beginning to sound like an advertisement--but it really is that awesome! beats christmas in bringing out the kid in you!<br /><br />this attraction alone already makes going to disney all worth it. ;)
