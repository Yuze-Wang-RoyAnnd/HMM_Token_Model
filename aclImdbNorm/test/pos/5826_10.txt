this show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama. there are twists and turns all the way till the season finally. the characters are very strong, and it gives the show a lot of power. when watching the show you feel for not only the prisoners, but the prison staff. the actors who play prisoners on this show have done a very good job portraying a prisoner. also if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows. the only problem with oz is that it was not long enough. this show could of easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old. even after the season finale i sill find myself watching oz all the time on dvd. this show is easily one of the best shows on television. don't be a fool, go watch oz.
