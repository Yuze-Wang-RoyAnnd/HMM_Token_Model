for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch. however, it also leaves you wanting more. i loved the way that every character (detective)made an appearance. least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie. my guess is bayless of course. this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes. this is a series i wish had lived on. thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv.
