another one that slipped by the radar of most anyone. this little b produced gem is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive, that a dreadful feeling about the lack of cojones in today's cinema slowly overtakes your body. the final set piece is so innovative in its setting and style that it prefigures everyone from tarantino to john woo. oh, and if you think "dying lines" are all cliche, wait for the dying line of ff. a piece of dialogue that could have torn you with laughter will take your heart. a true pleasure. seek it and see it. you won't be sorry.
