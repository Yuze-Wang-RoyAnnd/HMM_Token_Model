i must admit this is one of cameron diaz's unheard of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead. i was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters.<br /><br />both camilla belle and jordana brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sisters(in real life). this is one of those movies cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing.she looked the part of the gorgeous ,rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause.<br /><br />coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister faith, little girl phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for europe. as she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sister's boyfriend.<br /><br />great story and equally great location shooting around european.i will watch it again.
