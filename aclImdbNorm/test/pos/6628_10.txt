bergman's tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the barbarousness. with many memorable scenes throughout the film, i found particularly remarkable that close to the end where ullmann and von sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. a fascinating masterpiece!
