a tender movie that represents how our daily life is a catalyst that causes us to change our thoughts, behaviors and emotions into people we're not. this story is a love story where true emotions arise. i credit malcolm jamal warner (win) and challen cates for outstanding performances . a movie definitely worth seeing, a holiday roadtrip that turns into an emotional turn-a-round. i suggest seeing it.
