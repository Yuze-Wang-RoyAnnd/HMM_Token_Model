(spoilers?)<br /><br />i've heard some gripe about the special effects. but that should detract from the movie. the movie is a suspense film. and it's very good at that. so from that stand point, this movie rocks. franke rocks. enjoy to one's plastic hearts content. so no complaints for this movie. unless you watch the english dub, which is a total farce. it creates the illusion it's a b movie. <br /><br />one complaint i do have is the music video on the dvd. it doesn't say who sings it. i'd love to know. <br /><br />8/10<br /><br />quality: 10/10 entertainment : 10/10 replayable: 5/10
