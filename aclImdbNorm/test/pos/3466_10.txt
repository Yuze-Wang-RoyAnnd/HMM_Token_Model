i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called 'inside i'm dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.<br /><br />the film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. michael (steven robertson) suffers from cerabal palsy and rory (james mcavoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). they form a bond, as rory seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying. they eventually leave the home to live in a flat in carrigmore by themselves. they immediately employ the help of an attractive girl (romola garai) to look after them. the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman. thats the story in a nutshell, but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way... in fact... being unprepared as i was.. i found the tears were flowing way too often! in fact! i don't think i've cried so much watching a movie since the elephant man!!! this film is a huge drain on the emotions... both in the fun stuff, and the sad stuff. the acting is absolutely spot on! james mcavoy is my tip for greatness... he's a great irish actor and i think he has a great future ahead of him. steven robertson who plays michael was superb too... and it wasn't until today that i found out that he doesn't suffer from cerabal palsy and it was just some superb acting! brenda fricker is also in this film, and plays the part of the home's manager very well. the other great part has to be romola garai, she was wonderful as the love interest, and i reckon we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near future!<br /><br />the thing that makes this film work, is not only the synergies between the two leads, but the script... which is just so #### witty it literally is on fire! i still can't help repeating some of the lines in my head even now.<br /><br />the photography is good, although very bleak, but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ireland. the music is great in this film too, as well as the choice in songs... the use of the johnny cash cover of the nine inch nails track 'hurt' is inspired!! <br /><br />if i had to sum this film up in one word... it would be 'emotional'. this film is very very funny... and then on the turn of a coin its very very sad! i still can't believe that still two days after seeing the film, looking back on it i both laugh and almost cry! this film is amazing... and i hope it goes far! although i can't see that, as its advertising budget is probably very small! <br /><br />so go see it! i urge you... you wont regret it...
