john huston, actor and director better known for more robust fare such as "the misfits" and "african queen," directs his daughter, angelica huston, in what would be his last film. indeed, the film was released after huston's death. based on james joyce's novella of the same name, "the dead" tells the quiet story of a new year's celebration in 1904 dublin. huston, his cast and his screenwriters, including his son tony, have created a gem of a movie. the novella is among joyce's finest works (as well as being the only one that is filmable). the film is a tribute to huston's genius. he has taken a small,beautiful story and has made a small, beautiful movie. donal mccann and angelica huston shine (although "shine" is too showy, too flashy a word to describe their quiet, understated performances). "the dead" reflects the huston family's love for ireland and is, in its own quiet way, a fitting final movie for a legend.
