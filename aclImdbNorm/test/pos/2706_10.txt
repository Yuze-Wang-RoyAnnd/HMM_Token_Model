being an avid carpenter fan, i really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off i went to discover more. i must recommend a book by ray coleman - carpenters - the untold story. the book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. i hope you enjoy it. i remember cynthia gibb from her days in fame and gypsy. she is a singer (aswell as dancer) in her own right and i think this was the edge needed to create the character. some other actresses may have struggled with this. it is ashame the film did not delve deeper into her story. after all this is the film title, but i felt we learnt more about richard, but i suppose like any performer worth their salt, you should always leave them wanting more!
