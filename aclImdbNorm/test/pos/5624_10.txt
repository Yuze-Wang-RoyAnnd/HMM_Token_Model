chris smith's american movie is an insightful examination of the american dream. the movie focuses around mark borchardt, an independent film maker from wisconsin. mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an out of focus hi8 camera. the movie follows mark through his attempt to make his dream feature film, northwestern. there are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as mark goes through pre-production of northwestern and later his short film coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, mark says "sounds too much like oven,") which he plans to use to raise money to complete northwestern. this film's insight and humor is on par with roger and me, michael moore's great film. i first viewed it at a chaotic sundance film festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie- a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie, hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay; half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up. despite the delays, the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation. american movie also won the grand jury prize for documentary at the end of the festival. i highly recommend this fine film, worth sitting through any hellish screening.
