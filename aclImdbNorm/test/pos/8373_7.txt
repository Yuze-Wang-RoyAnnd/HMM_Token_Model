the only reason the duke is tops, one of several "race movies" made during the times of segregation, would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a 21-year-old singer named lena horne. she plays ethel andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor duke davis (ralph cooper) in order to branch into the big time. davis, however, has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so. he then teams up with doc dorando (lawrence criner) for a series of medicine shows throughout the south. meanwhile, in new york, her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the specialty act. davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his lineup of other specialty acts, many of whom make their one of their few or only film appearances here, for his chance at the big time with ethel next to him. guess what happens? while the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time, the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features i've seen during this black history month. ms. horne's singing is on good display here and it's interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career. among other supporting players there's an unconfirmed, according to imdb, appearance by lillian randolph, annie in my favorite movie it's a wonderful life and sister of amanda randolph who i just saw in the musical short the black network, as the woman with sciatica who complains of not being cured after taking the doc's medicine before duke explains it's for the feet! and as a longtime louisiana resident, i'd like to take note of two players from here in this movie: joel fluellen from monroe as a tonic customer and marie bryant from new orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. so for just lena horne alone, the duke is tops is worth seeing at least once.
