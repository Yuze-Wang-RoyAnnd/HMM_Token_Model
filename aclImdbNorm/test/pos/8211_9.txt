all the comments so far about this movie are negative but i have to say i found "the net" engaging. few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did. another plus for it is that most action/suspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity. i found it an enjoyable movie to watch. i am slightly biased though, being a big sandra bullock fan. *wink*
