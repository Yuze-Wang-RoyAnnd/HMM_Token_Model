of course i'm a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen.<br /><br />i was at camp pendleton undergoing infantry training when webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. it took about two or three days as best i can recall.<br /><br />webb and don dubbins were serious and businesslike.<br /><br />during the filming of our short scene--which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old--webb was very conscientious about getting things (marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception--that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses. never happen for a host of reasons.<br /><br />i have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their papaw when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force (no brag, just fact).<br /><br />what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles. that was before i realized that dis have to have some acting genes to get their job done. <br /><br />the only film i've seen since that is the equal of the di is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language. when the di was made, cursing wasn't allowed on screen. <br /><br />despite the lack of profanity, it's still a great movie to rent.<br /><br />ooooo-rahhhhhh!!!!!<br /><br />semper fi, do or die
