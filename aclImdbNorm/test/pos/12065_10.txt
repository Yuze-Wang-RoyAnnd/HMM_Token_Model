hilarious show with so many great stories, that it reflects the world today as we know it, in such a funny way it literally stole my laughters for other shows. i laughed so hard that i just found any other comedy shows unfunny. the unique confessions of each characters is a great original technique that just makes the show funny and very humorous. you may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family. that's what i thought at first but i found out that it holds new and unique techniques that completely sets it apart from any other average comedy show. michael rapaport is a star. i sure wish that this show wasn't canceled.
