i saw this film many years ago, and absolutely hated it -- i could not wait for it to end, and would have walked out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. you know what? i have never forgotten this film, and more, i would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. how many movies have i wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse, then forgotten as soon as i hit the street, like ... you see, i can't even think of one! rarer are films like death in venice that enter your consciousness and work sea changes. the french like to say film is an art, and movies like this one prove they are right. i give it 10 stars, up from the 3 i gave it the night i saw it.
