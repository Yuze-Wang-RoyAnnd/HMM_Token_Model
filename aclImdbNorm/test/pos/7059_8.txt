camp north star and it's camp counselor extraordinaire, tripper harrison(bill murray)sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival camp mohawk, an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend. meanwhile, we watch as tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor roxanne(kate lynch)as other teen counselors pair up and also fall head-over-heels. the film comes to head at the camp olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with tripper almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year. the film also shows the growing bond between tripper and a quietly lonely, puppy-dog eyed rudy(chris makepeace of "vamp" fame), whose dad is often away all the time. rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with tripper or taking his peanuts at blackjack. the film mostly contains hi-jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around.<br /><br />you have hottie counselors, total nerd spaz(jack blum)with his taped glasses and bad acne, beak-nosed "hardware"(matt craven)who likes to blow things up, fat kid fink(keith knight) who is often stuffing his face, amongst others in the film. there's a basketball game where poor spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival camp mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor fink tossing underhanded, between-his-knees fly-balls that sail over the back-board. there's camp fire coupling(with a spirited scary tale by tripper about a hook-handed killer)and boys drooling over the lovely ladies.<br /><br />yes, i know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality(such as the scenes with a sad makepeace and murray), but just as much as this recent viewing, i found myself giggling away. i'm licked and just can't help loving this. it's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you. i can't explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that floods forth when i see a sleepy murray's hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin. his intercom jokes are especially amusing. but, the flick is, let's be honest, a series of comic vignettes with murray dead-panning endlessly..not that there's anything wrong with that. the film, though, couldn't quite survive without him, could it? hard to even think of this movie without murray in the lead. it's a happier time and i think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown-ups still connect with "meatballs" warmly. and, poor morty(harvey atkin), the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth, and to beat camp mohawk for a change, is the constant source of tripper and gang's amusement as they often play gags on him..especially when he's sleeping on his bed! great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us.
