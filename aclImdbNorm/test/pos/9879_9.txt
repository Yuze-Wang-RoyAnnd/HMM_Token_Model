to understand "crash course" in the right context, you must understand the 80's in tv. most tv shows didn't have any point. the sitcom outpopulated the drama at least 3 to 1. they were still figuring out where the lines were so that they could cross them. (tv shows like "hail to the chief" was quite the bold step!) this made-for-tv movie "crash course" featured an all-star cast, bringing together members from all the 80's classics: "227", "family ties", "who's the boss?", et al. directors must've had a certain penchant for those all-star movies then. still, this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity. and that's not bad sometimes. viva soleil moon frye.
