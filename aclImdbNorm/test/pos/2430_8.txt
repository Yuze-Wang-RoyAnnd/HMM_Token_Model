it's out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess anastasia. apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(anderson's eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), anderson's unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tell......that's why i detest anna anderson and her confederates so much. not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.<br /><br />yet to some extent i have sympathy for anna anderson. life must have been hard for a young polish peasant worker in those days. and to impersonate another woman for 60+ years is an arduous task for anybody.she had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of anastasia's, and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem.<br /><br />anna anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track. had she put her good-looks, learned elegance, endurance, acting skills into proper use, she could of made a first-class actress.<br /><br />on a side note: some main characters of this two-parter seem to be loosely based on real figures. prince erich could be a mixture of gleb botkin(believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme), duke george and dmitri of leuchtenberg, and several other figures. and darya romanoff seem to be based on the gorgeous princess xenia georgievna romanova. but unlike the real confederates, prince erich was motiveless in this show and supported anna out of love for and sincere belief in her, which is touching.<br /><br />on the whole this is a great show. fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality. the power of amy irving's acting lies in that she successfully represented anderson's self-assuredness, the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing. just as princess xenia said about anderson:"she was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part." highly recommended.
