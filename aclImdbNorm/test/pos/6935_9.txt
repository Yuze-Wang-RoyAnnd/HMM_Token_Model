just finished with zombie bloodbath part one on the amazing zombie bloodbath trilogy dvd from camp motion pictures. zombie bloodbath 2: rage of the undead is next. now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there, but it is a better film on many levels. director todd sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films. again, this is not for people who want gloss and hollywood style horror films, this is for people who like their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. the story as far as i could tell, was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult. one guy is simply killed and the other, the one in charge, is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified and they stand him in the nearby field, still alive but dying. cut to present day and a van full of college kids break down near a farmhouse. at the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail. both groups end up at the same house. the house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes it's jacket, it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead. wow. and this is all in the first half hour. there is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a deli hostage. this actually works though, as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same deli. most of the twists work out pretty good, but it is obvious that the film was just too complex in some spots for it's own good. it all ends in a huge showdown with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of flesh eating bacteria vials. of course they throw it at the undead and cause some major melting and a few heads to explode and then we get an odd, thought provoking ending. first, let me say, that while it was not always easy to follow, i still had a major good time with this movie. it was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort. it was obvious that todd sheets was truly trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie film, and in that regard, he has succeeded. it had better special effects than the first film, great pacing and some cool music and visuals, plus there is a true show-stopper of a shot from inside a mouth as a knife is jammed through it. care was taken here and it shows. the weakness lies in the scripting and in a few of the lazier performances. again, i recommend listening to the commentary track. it was even better than the first one and i learned a lot. like finding out that some of the scenes were shot on super 8 film for effect and that the film came back ruined from the lab and they could nit use it. and they had already been editing the film by the time they got the film back, so some of the confusion is from a few scenes not being in the film. also, i learned that todd sheets truly has a passion and love for making horror movies. it shows. the film is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used one more rewrite, but still shines with more style than most dv films i see. not quite as fun as the first film, though a better movie technically. i really admire sheets as one of the true innovators and trailblazers in the area of dv cinema... and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!
