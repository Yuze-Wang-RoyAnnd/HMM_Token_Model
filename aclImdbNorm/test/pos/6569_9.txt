"uzumaki" takes place in a small japanese rural town,where people are going mad.they go nuts over vortexes and spirals.the crisis is getting worse,because people are turning into snails and vortexes appear everywhere."uzumaki" has to be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies i have seen.the plot is really clever and the gore scenes are really funny as the film doesn't takes itself too seriously."uzumaki" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top-notch.the characters are likeable and there is enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of japanese horror.despite of some hilarious scenes,the overall tone of this film is pretty dark."uzumaki" is not as good as "ringu","ju-on" or "audition",but if you like japanese horror movies you won't be disappointed.7 out of 10.
