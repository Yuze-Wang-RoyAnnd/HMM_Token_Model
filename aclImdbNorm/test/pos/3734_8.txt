hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! but if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for richard gere; this movie is right up your street. diane lane and richard gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'nights in rodanthe' is not a oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between middle aged good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you. i loved the theme of the story and it was quite relevant in many ways. of course the whole thing was presented in a superficial way, glossed over and not really dealt with.....i mean i would have liked to know more about the father/son relationship between gere and james franco, but the story was really about the idea that a great love can change you for the better; whether it is a lover, a child, a friend etc. the theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways. i was kind of surprised that james franco took such a small part in this film but he is always good even for a few minutes screen time. i really liked this film because it was moving and sweet.
