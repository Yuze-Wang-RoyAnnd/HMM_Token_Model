i wonder how someone could diss on this movie. it is based on an actual story. it is not necessarily about "rugby" itself so to the one that posted on here that they need to make a "real" rugby movie, you missed the point. this is not another typical sports movie where a team sucks, they hire emilio estevez and turn the team around and win the championship and give everyone the warm and fuzzies. it focuses on a story. it shows how someone can change his or her life for the better. the movies now days are all about sex, drugs, partying etc. that is hollywood. i am a big fan of movies, but i have to say this was an inspirational movie with a great message. if you consider yourself a "tough guy" don't watch the movie, it won't live up to your standards. if you want to watch a good, inspirational movie, this is a good one.
