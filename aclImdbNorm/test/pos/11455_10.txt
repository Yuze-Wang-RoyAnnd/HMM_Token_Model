this movie took me by surprise. the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. after that, we're plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. the characters, typical american teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. by the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. it's a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. thankfully, once the action kicks in, it's full blown old school horror! steve johnson's make-up effects are awesome. equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. and the scares are jolting. kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. the tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like "night of the living dead" or "hills have eyes." but for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of "house on the haunted hill." the set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking?
