i read ashew's comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture! <br /><br />i just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised.<br /><br />to address ashew's comments:<br /><br />trail street is a very well done western.<br /><br />and randolph scott was in it quite a bit! <br /><br />gabby hayes was funnier than i've ever seen him! <br /><br />the bad guys had very good comeuppances as far as i was concerned.<br /><br />plus:<br /><br />it was interesting to see robert ryan as a straight-laced good guy - he's usually so slimy.<br /><br />in all, a good western, very well acted and written.<br /><br />i liked the background story of kansas and the "winter wheat" that supposedly helped it become a state, too.<br /><br />i thought the girl who played susan was lovely - can't think why she didn't become a bigger star!
