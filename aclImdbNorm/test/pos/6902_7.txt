this movie was fun, if all over the board.<br /><br />it essentially follows the comedic romp of two grave-robbers in 19th century england, who move from conventional body snatching to trafficking in vampires, zombies and dead roswell aliens. (i have no idea what the roswell alien was doing in there, and neither did the producers, i think.) <br /><br />but was it funny? you bet. even ron perlman, who is often the kiss of direct to dvd death was pretty good in this one as a priest who turns out to be the ringleader of a rival gang of body-snatchers.<br /><br />a real joy to watch this hilarious little film, and a good example of what you can do when you don't have larger than life egos on either side of the camera.
