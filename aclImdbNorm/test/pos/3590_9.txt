i admit to being in awe of the sea and have spent a number of years in the navy, so i am somewhat biased on this one. i missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on dvd this christmas (2002) and i got it! some of the film is amazing and i have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton blue whales 'cruising' through the sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines. i like the level of information and facts conveyed through the narration, it is just right, i don't want to know a load of science just some of the basics, to see these things is enough for most people. the bbc has a knack of putting things at the right level for the intended audience.<br /><br />a really great documentary, up there with 'the world at war for' me, the dvd is of excellent quality. if i had a minor criticism it would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there, i think they detract from some of the scenes. but well done to the bbc and discovery.
