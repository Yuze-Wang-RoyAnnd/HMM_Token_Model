blythe danner and judith ivey deliver wonderful performances here as jonathan silverman, as eugene, recounts his life in 1937's brighton beach.<br /><br />what makes the film so good is the relationships among the characters with a backdrop of extremely wonderful family values.<br /><br />bob dishy had a marvelous opportunity here as the father of the clan. he gives a restrained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family.<br /><br />his sons played by jonathan silverman and brian dillinger are fabulous. there are certain scenes when silverman is skating or hopping where i'm reminded of jerry lewis.<br /><br />as for danner and ivey, they too are wonderful. their mannerisms, intonation and idealism of the jewish culture are beautifully realized by them.<br /><br />the cinematography is just wonderful. beautiful brighton in 1937! even as the inevitability of war loomed, the film is rich with many of the typical problems faced by families in that period. in a sense, you don't have to be jewish to experience what the family is going through.<br /><br />a must see for nostalgic buffs, and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.
