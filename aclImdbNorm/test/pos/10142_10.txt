excellent cast, story line, performances. totally believable. i realize the close knit group that exemplifies the marine corps. but this movie brought fear to my heart. the marines let principles be damned. it seems that this film was based on real life incidents. it shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment. anne heche was utterly convincing. sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering. and eric stoltz as her attorney was so deft balancing his loyalty to the corp but also his loyalty to his client, while high above on his tightrope. he knew what his true course of action had to be. but he was pulled apart by his immersion in the marine tradition, loyalty to the corps above all else. i sat riveted to the tv screen. all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.
