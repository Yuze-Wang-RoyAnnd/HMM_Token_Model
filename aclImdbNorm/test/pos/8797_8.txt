this film has a brilliant soundtrack and superb acting from some pretty unknown faces. i especially like the welsh docklands bad boy characters in it who strut around like american rappers acting tough. the banter between jip and koop is brilliant they come across as being best mates almost as if it were true in real life. i have experienced some of the things in this film and let me tell you first hand these folks ain't acting (especially the seen with jip and koop talking and snorting coke). danny dyer is priceless as moff the 'party prescription' dealer and has the funniest lines in the film...<br /><br />"i'm happiest when i'm off my pickle feeling the music, you get me.... yeaahhh! i knew you wouldn't let me down, i knew it!!!"
