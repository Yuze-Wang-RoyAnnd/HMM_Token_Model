i saw this film when it first came out and have never forgotten it. my uncle antoine is much, much greater than the sum of it's parts. the movie, loosely, is about a pre-adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in canada. there are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building. mua has a leisurely pace but have patience, the reward is coming. i believe the film was sub-titled and as with all non-english speaking movies i've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version. inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the additional necessity of lip-synching lines that don't quite fit. the english speaking amarcord is a travesty, for example, while the sub-titled version sings. my uncle antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in french.
