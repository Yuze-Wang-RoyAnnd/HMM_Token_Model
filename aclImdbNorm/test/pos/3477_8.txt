in dublin, the crippled rebel rory o'shea (james mcavoy) moves to the carrigmore residential home for the disabled, affecting the lives of the residents. roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of michael connolly (steven robertson), who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago due to his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. rory convinces michael to move from carrigmore to an apartment in dublin, and they hire the gorgeous siobhan (romola garai) to assist them. living together with rory, michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom and learning to survive by his own. <br /><br />"inside i'm dancing" is a wonderful tale of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. the acting of steven robertson and james mcavoy are awesome and i do not understand how they have not been nominated to the oscar with such magnificent performances. romola garai has also a top-notch performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. the screenplay is touching, never corny and without redemption and the precise direction of damien o'donnell is very sensitive. unfortunately the brazilian title of the dvd is shamefully ridiculous, giving a wrong idea of this excellent movie. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "os melhores dias de nossas vidas" ("the best years of our lives")
