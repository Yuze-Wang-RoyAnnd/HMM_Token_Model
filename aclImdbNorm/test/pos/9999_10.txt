although i'm not a golf fan, i attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it. the historical settings, the blatant class distinctions, and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line held my attention throughout. the actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing. and i was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow. toward the end of this movie, "seabiscuit" came strongly to mind, although "the greatest game ever played" is far less complex a story than that film. in both cases, the fact that the events really happened deepened my interest.
