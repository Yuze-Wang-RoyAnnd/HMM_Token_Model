perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after halloween (although made from irwin yabalans from halloween), i must say i honestly found "tourist trap" to be scarier and funner. "tourist trap" is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then, and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise. it was destiny i tell you, but one night i was at my local blockbuster (one or two months before it went out of business), and had nothing to get. then i stumble upon this movie, i think huh seems like a laughable b-movie, i rent it and took it home, boy was i in for a good scare. "tourist trap" comes off as a bad movie, it definitely has it's cheesy moments,but in the end you're having to much fun with it to really care.<br /><br />the things that impressed me the absolute most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones i've seen, is number one the setting. a horror movie without a good setting isn't very fun, not here. i just love love love the location, it feels like we can relate to it, it almost feels like we've been there before. which makes it creepier. next is the characters, non of them are really stereotypical, and they all have a real personality. for example they're not stoners, alcoholics, or even sex obsessed people, they feel like normal young adults. plus they look realistic enough, and then their is chuck connors. who gives a great performance as mr. slausen who we all take an instant liking too because again he's so real, he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore. the last, and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us (the audience) jump half way out of our seats, and turn on the rights, for the right reasons. for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch, but in "tourist trap" prepare yourself, that's not the case. with it's perfect use of lighting, mannequins, and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out. plus i love because although they may go a bit over-the-top with some things you still feel like this could happen. which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do, and that is make us (the audience) feel unsafe and terrified.<br /><br />overall as far as any major problems go, i have none, only that it's weirdness may get a little too weird at times. however in the end "tourist trap" holds a place near and dear to my heart, for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling.
