plunkett and macleane is a wonderful updating of the swashbuckling tradition, predating johny depp and his pirate friends. the tone is lighthearted, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. one could almost see errol flynn and basil rathbone in this.<br /><br />it starts out in low gear, with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but, it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the highways. the robberies are grand and stylish, with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers. the actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit, which is fairly hollow. there's not much depth to the figures, but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />muh has been said about the modern music. period music tended to the more serene, which seems out of place. a classical score with celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work, but the more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action. since the characters are more legend than reality, accuracy in the music seems pointless. the pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes, so it mostly works well. i just wonder how they missed adam ant's "stand and deliver." make no mistake, this is not a serious film. it's pure escapism and a wonderful lark. tony scott shows some of the visual flair of his father, but i don't think we are going to see many oscar nods in his career just yet. he seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film. with time he may prove to be a name to reckon with. his father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director. this is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling film fest.
