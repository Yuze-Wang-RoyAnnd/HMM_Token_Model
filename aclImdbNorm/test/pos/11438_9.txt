this movie is almost never seen today - the only reason i can enjoy it again and again is from a slightly worn out vhs copy i made when the film was shown on tv in 1991 here in england.<br /><br />an ensemble cast are obviously enjoying themselves and this is reflected to the viewer. a razor sharp script helps things along, and once you've seen this you will want to watch it over and over again.<br /><br />wayne rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great film, with a great jazz soundtrack to boot. there are emotional moments during the film, but never to the point of sickly sweet sentimentalism - these are guys on the trip of a lifetime, and they convey that excitement wonderfully.<br /><br />highly recommended if you can actually get to see it.
