in everything is illuminated, elijah wood plays jonathan foer, a jewish american who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during wwii. in a sense, the woman that saved his entire family.<br /><br />this is a heart-felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. a stranger in a strange land so to speak. jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the ukraine (he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). but what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated. this movie will make you laugh and will make you cry. elijah wood is really good in this film, based on the novel by jonathan safran foer.<br /><br />from someone i talked to, this movie is somewhat different from the book. a book i gather is really good. nevertheless, this is a good movie, it has something for everyone and i really enjoyed it. can someone say oscar?
