this has to be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). it really taught me when i watched when i was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom of a being a child slips away sooner then we expect it to. also joseph mazzello has to be my favorite actor ever, and i think that him and elijah wood did a great job in the roles of brothers. this movie is quite sad, and some people don't understand the ending. but the story itself is quite incredible, the thought of a poor 7 year boy (bobby)getting abused by drunken step father is horrible, and what the two boys do about this is sad, and important. my favorite part of the movie is when tom hanks (older mike) lists the 7 things of being a kid that are lost to the grownup world. however there are some parts that could have been done better in this movie, such as the casting of the mother (lorraine braco), who i think is a horrible actor. "the king" played his role well, since it is a hard role to play. joseph and elijah definitely were the stars of the movie. i couldn't believe how well they played victims of a abusing stepfather, being the age that they were (7 and 9). but overall, i recommend this movie to anyone, who loves great child actors, and a great movie. :)
