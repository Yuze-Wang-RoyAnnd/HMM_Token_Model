had no idea what i was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940. however, i always enjoy viewing laraine day, (katie lattimer) who plays the role as a younger sister to jean muir, (helen lattimer) and also their mother, billie burke, (mrs. julia lattimer). thought i was going to be bored with the story of two sister's and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with robert cummings, (ridley crane) who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of gals and is a heavy drinker who parties all the time. one night, helen lattimer goes on a date with ridley and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car. it is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely hold your attention right to the very end of the film.
