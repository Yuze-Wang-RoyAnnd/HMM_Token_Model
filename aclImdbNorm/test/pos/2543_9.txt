this is marvelous movie, about a soul of ale. this is a journey to ale's heart. i found it fascinating. the director did a great job. he makes the scenes talk. especially on the silent scenes. the window of ale is a great one. an the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes i have seen. <br /><br />apart from directing. it has been a quite time i did not watch a movie about a soul. as a philosopher i can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul. so as ale's soul. <br /><br />as living in turkey i do not care about the other side of ny. this is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world. as to my opinion more universal than every other thing. <br /><br />do not miss this film. otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. if you have one. <br /><br />baris.sentuna
