i enjoyed this film immensely. i'm really into films where females kick lots of butt, so this film already had my hopes up for some decent entertainment. my hopes were met and exceeded less than 20 minutes into the film. the action, humor and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favorite films of all time. it had sam jackson and his undeniable screen presence, geena davis as i've never seen her before, demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you don't want to give it.<br /><br />geena plays samantha caine, an amnesiac desperate to remember something about her past, but quickly realizing, the more she finds out the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally samantha is so more and charly is all that's left. but now, can charly and sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? we have characters that pop in and out of the film that nurture each side of sam/charly, like sam jackson, and craig bierko. craig is also irresistible as timothy, the sexy bad guy with no conscience.<br /><br />this film was perfectly casted, and perfectly acted, over the top and wonderfully entertaining. you watch the impossible happen and applaud when it does. so worth your time. watch it, you won't be sorry.
