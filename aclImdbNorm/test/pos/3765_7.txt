it took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on dvd (and my vcr is not worth hooking up again). i guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. but i found a decent bootleg on ebay and i must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. it is a slap stick spoof in the vein of "airplane." i must say that when i watched it on showtime or spotlight growing up in the 80s, i enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than i do now. but it's definitely worth watching just to see what they(i.e., movie makers) were able to get away with before the "just say no" hypocrites unleashed their propaganda. sing..."we are all on drugs" hahaha it's a silly film and worth the $10 i paid off of ebay to get it on dvd just don't even think about comparing it to the original - that's just plain stupid. what are you high?
