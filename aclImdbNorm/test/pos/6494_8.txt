thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless. i think jason is being judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father. maybe he's not as great as some of those actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. <br /><br />i watched the movie some years ago, and i actually loved it. i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood. but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on. it was really good!<br /><br />during the movie, i actually forgot he was the son of. sean.. who?<br /><br />and if you're a shakespeare lover, i can recommend this movie. i'm sure you'll enjoy it!
