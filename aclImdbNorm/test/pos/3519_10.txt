just before dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! this movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job mr. lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. the opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! and the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars! if you are looking for a gore-fest, don't look here. but, if you want chills sent down your back, see this one. there are 6 deaths and one of them you don't see but, it leaves you mind to think "how was she killed?" the stranded theme reminded me of 1977's the hills have eyes, which followed kind of the same concept, but in the desert with canninbals. but, still slasher fans, give this forgotten gem, i promise you, you will be staisfied!
