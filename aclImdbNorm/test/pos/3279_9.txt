thank you mario van peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.<br /><br />the plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. it was great that you used so many african-american artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. it was also good to see billy zane in this movie. does he ever play a good guy?<br /><br />i would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. this is an excellent movie and i feel privileged to have seen it. hopefully, you'll feel the same.
