i am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that richard gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. i would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. i was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. the daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. the movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece. go rent it, see if you don't shed a tear.lol if you like the notebook, you will love this one. the beach scenes were immaculately shot. even though the hurricane scenes were a little off sequence, it was still a bit panicy to watch them react to it.
