my teacher did this movie. it's a new beginning. watch it, and you won't notice that it is a romanian movie. the old boring style has gone. now it's something else. a post-revolutionary movie. it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. they are unique. you won't even know that you're watching, you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and you'll feel every frame. don't miss it, pay attention to the plot but don't ignore the details. they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies. you will hear some music at some point. it's representative for a part of us, but it does not represent us. please, just keep your head straight and leave your body free.
