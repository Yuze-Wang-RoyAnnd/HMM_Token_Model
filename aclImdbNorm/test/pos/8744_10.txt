i remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time. watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later, i still think traffik is brilliant and much better than the us film that was based on this drama.<br /><br />it should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs, as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were back then at the end of the 80s, and unless they change their policies, will be so in another 20 years.<br /><br />well written, well made, beautifully acted and superbly filmed. a thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade.
