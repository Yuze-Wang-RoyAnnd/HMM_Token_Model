after watching john preform this one of a kind show, i had to share.....it was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child. i like the fact that with every character he "became," you could picture what they looked like. it is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "freak" is what real "stand up" should be. john is real talent.
