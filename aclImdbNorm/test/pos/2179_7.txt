well, i've just seen buster keaton's film debut in fatty arbuckle's the butcher boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-i found plenty to laugh at. like when buster orders molasses from butcher boy fatty, fatty makes buster come back to pay, buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, fatty dumps molasses in buster's hat and takes money, buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck, fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor, buster's feet are now stuck on floor and so on. that probably didn't read funny but on screen it was hilarious as were some more slapstick involving flour being thrown and a later sequence that takes place in fatty's girlfriend's boarding school with fatty dressed in drag and buster helping fatty's rival also in drag. like i said, many scenes don't make a lick of sense but the visuals, especially those involving arbuckle and keaton, are laugh inducing even today. recommended viewing for keaton completists.
