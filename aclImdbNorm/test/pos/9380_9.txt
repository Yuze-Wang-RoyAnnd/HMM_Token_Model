never has the words "hidden gem" been so accurate. bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity, sometimes coming up short with stuff like weasels rip my flesh, but other times, luck will prevail and you might end up with something like death bed, then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all, it just has a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that might throw you off, but somehow death bed still fits into the "bad" category. with a vibe that's somber and empty, death bed is a true masterpiece of low-budget horror, reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision.<br /><br />death bed involves an incoherent, yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait, who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds. although not all that scary, considering it's about a killer bed, death bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror. a dark, desolate vibe, confusion, an eerie, subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts. such a quality, or vibe usually seems unintentional. not only is it intentional, but from what i've read, death bed is based on an actual dream, george barry, the director, successfully transferred dream to film, only a genius could accomplish such a task.<br /><br />old mansions make for good quality horror, as do portraits, not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid, quite a bizarre dream, indeed. also, this isn't quite the brand of b-horror i was expecting, considering the title and all. before viewing this gothic gem i expected something more like class reunion massacre, now thats a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what i'm saying. after considering all of the above, i feel like death bed deserves only eight stars, but since it stayed so obscure for so long we'll say the bed that eats deserves nine.
