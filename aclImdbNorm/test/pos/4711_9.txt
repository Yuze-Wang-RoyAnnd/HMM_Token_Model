i am afraid i will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain flabbergasted that this film has still not ( sept 2007 ) been issued on dvd. it's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle, especially when you consider the amount of dvd's available today containing material that should have been binned years ago. still i have an excellent digital vhs copy in english with subtitles and nicam stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film. as to the film itself, this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a european ). how true the film fits in with the reality in burma i have no idea, indeed, that is less important, the essential thing is that entertainment-wise, it is a success. one soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and i admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene. it's a shame we hear so little about countries such as burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country. has the situation changed since 1995 ? the events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding "no" and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !
