a nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure. the czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story. the flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself, but then again, this really isn't an action movie. though it does not have anything in common with the james salter novel "the hunters" that became the movie about korean war f86 sabre pilots, dark blue world had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it. better in some ways than battle of britain in that it doesn't rely on big name actors. suggest viewing this movie with some czech beer and some czech dumplings called kneldniky(sp).
