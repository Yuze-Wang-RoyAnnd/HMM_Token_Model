eric bogosian gives as great a performance as you'll ever see in an oliver stone film. his barry character is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he blows away anyone, on or off the air, that offends him. adapted from bogosian's stage play, "talk radio" is a vicious and frightening ride that doesn't let you off until it's too late. by then, you've become familiar with the fringe of racists, rapists, paranoids, wannabe assassins and mere prank callers who listen, speak and lurk in the dark of dallas nights. <br /><br />stone behaves himself, if that's even possible, letting bogosian dominate every scene, from barry's humble beginnings to the make or break point when his radio show can reach national syndication. the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as the lovers and/or co-workers that all have being used and tossed aside by barry in common. <br /><br />the only thing i'd change is the recurring theme music, "bad to the bone". i'd have used bachman-turner overdrive's "not fragile". a better song, one i haven't heard in a film so far and a driving, relentless tune whose ominous riff is like the true soundtrack to barry's life.<br /><br />listen if you dare!
