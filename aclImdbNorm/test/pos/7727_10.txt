i thoroughly enjoyed carmen, better than original sin (angelina jolie & antonio bandaras), which share some thematic similarities, and which i also enjoyed very much. i felt the acting was stronger here (paz vega displayed a wider range, has more fire; and sbaraglia was also great). overall, their acting was more gritty, more believable (less dreamy than original sin, and both actors here had less 'celebrity status' and 'pretty face' to depend on to make the movie work. vega definitely sizzles, as to be expected.<br /><br />director vincente aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than original sin) that lets you feel the grime and the daily goings-on of archaic spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart on the street, workers changing the candles of the street lamps, all in the background of the action. <br /><br />whilst i greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme fatals (like brian de palma's femme fatale), carmen is a poignant, modern take in the tradition of the noir classic double indemnity, and is a delightful pleasure to watch. this is another fine example of the triumph of daring european cinema over glitzy and safe hollywood fare.
