nicely filmed, a little uneven, "nobody" is a good evening's entertainment. the plot is simple enough--three yuppies get into a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar, and it turns out to be much more than they bargained for. the acting is decent, and there are a few unexpected twists. watch for the completely unbelievable (like the 10 shot revolver, and 25 shot semi-automatic handgun).
