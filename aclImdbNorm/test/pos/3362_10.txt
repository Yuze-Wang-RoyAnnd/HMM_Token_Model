in my opinion dads army is thee best british sitcom of all time. i believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) you must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. when you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works. watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this. you'll not be disappointed. good episode to watch is "no spring for frazer"
