1992's "batman returns" was tim burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. gotham city again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. it was also clever to see how burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman max shreck(christopher walken)and the plan to make the "penguin"(danny devito) mayor of gotham! anyway keaton again returns as "batman"/bruce wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in selina kyle only ms. kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous "catwoman"(michelle pfeiffer). a plan forms between both villains to destroy gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. the performance from michelle pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played "the catwoman" any better and devito was perfect as the "penguin" his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. "batman returns" is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.
