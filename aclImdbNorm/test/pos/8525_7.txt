i've always liked sean connery, but as james bond i've always favored roger moore. still it was connery who set the bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than james bond, the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of spectre.<br /><br />and what designs they are in never say never again. spectre with the help of a foolish young air force officer who happens to be kim bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now spectre headed by blofeld, played here by max von sydow is threatening blackmail of the world.<br /><br />von sydow's operations guy is klaus maria brandauer who is also courting bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. and he's got a female assassin working for him in barbara carrera who makes angelina jolie as nora croft look like mrs. butterworth.<br /><br />but before sean connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'm' running things at british intelligence. edward fox thinks connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the british taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. i really did enjoy fox's performance, he's like the great grandson of colonel blimp.<br /><br />i also enjoyed carrera, she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. when she's scuba diving with connery in the bahamas, note how she puts mr. shark on 007's case.<br /><br />will connery do james bond again? he was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point, roger moore's father? but i think connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.
