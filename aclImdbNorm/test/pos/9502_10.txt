cecil b. demille directed a series of domestic comedy-dramas in the late teens and early 20s. he found his perfect leading lady for these provocative pieces in gloria swanson. in don't change your husband, swanson plays a bored housewife whose wealthy businessman husband (elliott dexter) pays more attention to work than to her. she is chased by a handsome roue (lew cody) until she relents and divorces the boring husband for the new lover.<br /><br />things soon become familiar and swanson discovers the new husband is as neglectful as the first. to make matters worse she discovers cody has a woman on the side (julia faye). after several confrontations and convenient meetings, things are resolved.<br /><br />this was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make gloria swanson a major star. although she was only 20 when she filmed this she is very good as the maybe foolish wife. she looks great and wears some stunning gowns.<br /><br />there is one memorable scene that is 100% demille in which cody is luring swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure, and love. as he coos to her she imagines the scenes. pleasure is a fantastic scene of swanson in a spidery hammock swinging out over a pool while people dance around. wealth is a scene in which swanson is gowned like a babylonian queen as servants bring her chests of jewels, which shes tosses aside. love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph making love in a forest glade with a pan-like character (ted shawn). pure hokum but very entertaining, and swanson looks great.<br /><br />dexter is very good as the bland husband who shaves off his moustache and starts to work out in order to win his wife back. cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. faye is funny as the bitchy other woman--named toodles no less--who gets hers. sylvia ashton plays mrs. huckney. ted shawn was married to ruth st. denis and together they were groundbreaking and influential modern dancers (of the denishawn school).<br /><br />swanson impresses me more every time i see her. she seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face that is just mesmerizing. she's a joy to watch.<br /><br />very entertaining film with lots of color tints in varying scenes to keep things lively. and a lot of the furnishings are back in style 86 years later.
