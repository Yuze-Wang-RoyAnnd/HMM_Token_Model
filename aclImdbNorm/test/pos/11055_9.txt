i would say that this film is disturbing. the brutality is depicted in a very sick way, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. in the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. the scenes are ferocious, starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. every emotion is exploited to extreme, the frustration of the butcher, the love for his daughter almost incestuous, the rage when he finds out she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. this film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. the message of the film is that one's life can change in a second as a consequence of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's acting. i'd loved the unique manner of filming, the simplicity and the brutality accompanied with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce through.
