i have just seen this broadcast on channel 4. having seen some of the earlier comments here i think i would like to state firstly that i am not in favour of the death penalty. with that out of the way, i was expecting great things of this film, but it just didn't quite deliver. dead man walking is very cleanly done, with good performances all round, and a good script. in fact it's hard to fault it artistically. however, i felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment, it seemed to become sidetracked by the religious/moral stance (hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun). although i'm not a heartless individual, i didn't really empathise with any of the characters in the story. if you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film. i think that peter medak's let him have it was a much more powerful and moving film, and i would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that.
