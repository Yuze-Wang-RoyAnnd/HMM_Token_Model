a real sudsy soap opera here as spencer tracy tackles the role of an illiterate until the age of 20. he marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to success.<br /><br />success but no happiness here. a n'eer-do-well son and a faltering marriage leads to disaster and tragedy. tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous rail strike and the death of 406 workers.<br /><br />the film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here.<br /><br />a double separate suicide here. we know that riches can't buy happiness but this is a little too far fetched. nonetheless, we have riveting performances by tracy and colleen moore. ms. vinson, as the 2nd wife, is also quite effective.
