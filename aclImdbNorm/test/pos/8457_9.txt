the first thing you see in this film is a static angle(one which will be repeated later in the film), depicting the chaos going on(unseen to the audience) in a studio that airs news. soon after, fonda's character's typical story is shown, in that same angle. don't let this mislead you; the film is not about a female reporter, a woman struggling to succeed in a male-dominated profession. that is merely a lead-in, a way of starting the film(though it's used later). the actual point to this production is revealed gradually, and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on. the entire film has that pace; not slow or drawn-out, but deliberate. it's never really fast, even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so. this pacing(especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed, as the disturbing, unsettling nature of the film is unraveled) is strong, almost painful to the viewer. it inspires you to, if it had been possible, jump into the screen, grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to *do* something about it, to remedy the situation. never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. the subject is extremely important to be aware of, and it's handled perfectly here. no over-dramatization(well... very little, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the issue. the direction is astounding. the empathy felt for lemmon's character is profound. the editing is masterful... one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly. the editor, judging from his filmography, is vastly underrated. the writing was excellent. the acting was great, in particular by lemmon, fonda and douglas(who also produced it). the lack of a score is perfect; no music is needed to enhance. the ending is sublime and effective. the movie does have a few negative points... among them, some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition, one particular part of the film, whilst dramatic, doesn't seem to mesh with something that follows it. not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly (and rightfully so) attributed to bad movies; the pacing(which can be mistaken as being slow) and the (lack of) score. one could argue that to be a negative thing, as everyone ought to consider the points it presents, but maybe it's better this way; handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect(for the topic as well as the viewer)... something like this, maybe it shouldn't be spoon-fed. i was mesmerized with the film, and left very taken aback. i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it. 9/10
