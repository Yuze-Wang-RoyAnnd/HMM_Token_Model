i first saw this film in austria when it first came out, and i was entranced by it. it is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all connoisseurs of motion picture art. what a shame that it has never been released in dvd format. perhaps one of these days that will be rectified, as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever.<br /><br />why is it that 'b' movies like 'american wedding' and 'eurotrip' get widescreen and fullscreen releases, and often a special edition with multiple commentaries and extras, while great art pieces like 'the dead' are all but forgotten?
