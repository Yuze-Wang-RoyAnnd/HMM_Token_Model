this film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs, and it's a crying shame. its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted oscar nominations for the great screenwriter i.a.l. diamond's adaptation, and ingrid bergman's flawless performance. it must have been an honor for goldie hawn at such a young age to work with bergman, looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years--fifty four! when she's on the screen, it positively twinkles.<br /><br />this is a film which may appear dated at first, but it actually made me wish i was around during the swingin' 'sixties. hawn's fashions are as tacky as bergman's are chic. (that's one minor flaw--isn't her character a little too soign'ee for a gal who still lives with her sister? but then again, would we have ingrid any other way?) and who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called the slipped disc?<br /><br />the best compliments i can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that i never saw, and that it left me wanting more. speaking of wanting more, i wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor rick lenz? (he resembles griffin dunne in this film.) this was his film debut, and i don't see any other major roles in his filmography. as for goldie hawn, she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed, but i can't imagine any other actor in the role, either.<br /><br />since the movie is based on a play, the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y, but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. in fact, i am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty-five years. because this film represents a bygone era, it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. it is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. but don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. grade: a
