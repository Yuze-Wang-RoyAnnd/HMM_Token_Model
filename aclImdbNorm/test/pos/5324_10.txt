every role, down to the smallest, has been cast and acted with bravado.<br /><br />the extraordinary jena malone never takes a misstep. her two co-stars are equal to her in this film. ryan gosling may be the best actor of his generation. chris klein gives his best performance to date. this is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults. you'll think and talk about this film for days. highly recommended.
