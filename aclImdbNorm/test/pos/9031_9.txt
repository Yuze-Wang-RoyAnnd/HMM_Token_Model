it's too bad iameracing wants to deny the reality of faulkner's and clarence brown's purpose in the creating of the story and film of "intruder in the dust". i suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any southerner to bear and i can understand that. but to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. yes (to borrow your use of the upper case) iameracing, there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the south get along quite well. but to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live, the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary. sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding. sometimes it was only as long as blacks 'knew their place'. the point of making juano hernandez character (in film and print) a somewhat prickly type, not warm and fuzzy, was to underscore the fact that bigotry is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. <br /><br />it would do iameracing good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to americans of all stripes. the fact is that black people (among others) did not, as a rule, not an exception, receive the benefits of the justice system as even-handedly as whites. segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical fact. people like iameracing might claim these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. it would be a wonderful thing if iameracing's southern ancestors (if any)never participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country's history and i hope they didn't. if that is so congratulations to them but that fact, if true, does not erase the fact that others did. and even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the south (and other areas, let's not forget the draft riots of the civil war era)were only half as numerous, only a third, does that make them any less horrible? is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred? <br /><br />iameracing asks us to get the "mississippi burning" chip off of our shoulders before we see "intruder in the dust", well i ask you, did the murders of the civil rights activists happen or not? why should that be forgotten? forgiven? maybe. but in order to prevent their recurrence they cannot be forgotten or revised into minor occurrences. the racism that is displayed in "intruder in the dust" is displayed there quite purposely. it is there to make a point. <br /><br />on a cinematically historical level it is also ridiculous for iameracing to discount the racial angle. any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960's knows that black actors/characters/extras were usually deliberately cast. to judge from our movie history; wars were always fought by middle aged white men; there were no black people in the old west; it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person; there were no black hospital orderlies,taxi drivers,clerks, salespeople etc. blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor. if falukner (and brown) had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the hernandez character black. <br /><br />racism exists iameracing. probably for different reasons i am sure, we both wish that it didn't but it does. wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably can't be helped but it still does not make them so.
