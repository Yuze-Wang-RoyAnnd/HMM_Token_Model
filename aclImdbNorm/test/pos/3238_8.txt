i just checked out northanger abbey from the local library, and wasn't expecting much. imagine my suprise at this gothic treat! northanger abbey is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen, with empty passageways and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets. the glory of the movie is that it never reveals all: your imagination runs free, running with the imagination of the main character, one kathrine m. she is a girl of wild imaginations, a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings into her (and our) real world.<br /><br />if i were to use one word to describe this excellent movie, it would be surrealistic. dreams are woven throughout the movie, enhancing the mood. sometimes, it is hard to tell what is real and what is not; this is intentional, i believe.<br /><br />atmosphere reigns supreme. the music is not what you'd expect of a movie by jane austen: it is eerie, flute and drum based, high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear. if a soft, pleasant tune were playing in northanger abbey, it would be positively inviting. now, it is foreboding, a grim and stark-walled palace of madmen. (but! the characters! you shall have to see them for yourself!)<br /><br />if you are looking for a most enjoyable evening, look no further than northanger abbey.
