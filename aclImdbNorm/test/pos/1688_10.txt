when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january (2005) i didn't like it. i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, judith light, acted were so unlike her. (which of course is true) and then i watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and i felt pretty much the same. then i watched it again two sundays ago (march 20th, 2005) and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing. i even cried the first 2 times, but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hers.<br /><br />it is a very well acted and done tv movie. judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film! i keep watching it over and over. it's a sad movie, but very good.<br /><br />if you have not seen this movie, i definitely recommend it! it's not usually my type of movie, but i did enjoy this one! a+++
