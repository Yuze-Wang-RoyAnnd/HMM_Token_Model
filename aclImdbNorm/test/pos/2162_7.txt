here is a much lesser known 50's sci-fi with a little different twist. an atomic researchers son is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the the father's atomic secrets.<br /><br />this is a tightly knit atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values and above average acting, even from the kid. the atomic city actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50's sci-fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a tv show.<br /><br />the atomic city was also actually nominated for an academy award for best screenplay - how many other 50's sci-fi can tout an academy award nomination?<br /><br />great pacing, tight direction and some superb location filming in the 'real' atomic city of los alamos, new mexico make this one worth hunting down. the collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the atomic man!! <br /><br />recommended.
