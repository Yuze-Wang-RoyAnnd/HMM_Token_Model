it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy holly's death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake, iowa who remember it vividly. that has to be a haunting memory, lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of "american pie", as it pays tribute to the day the music died. the world lost some tremendous talent that day, lives cut short way before their prime, and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacy.<br /><br />i watched the film today some thirty years after it's original theatrical release. thirty years, i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that. i had forgotten a lot of it, while remembering some of the little things, like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the band's name. but most of all, i remember the music. it's hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of "oh boy" or "that'll be the day", and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes. i'm with buddy on that score at least, how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them? funny how each successive decade brought it's own threat to the fabric of society - the beatles, motown, disco and a whole host of other musical forms. we're still listening and dancing to the beat, so i guess they couldn't have been all that bad.<br /><br />there was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about. this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasn't seeing things my way. i've done that a number of times over the years, but by now had forgotten the source. well, i should be good for another thirty years or so now.<br /><br />you certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly. seeing him today, one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses, but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod. don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddy's band members, though their characters take a back seat to much of the story. i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture, names like sam cooke and king curtis, without ever dwelling on their presence. <br /><br />i'll always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties - 'oldies' they call them now. i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too, but you can't replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen. which only goes to reinforce the idea that i'll keep on enjoying the music until, well, the day i die.
