i thought i'd witnessed every wrinkle the crime/gangster flick had to offer, but the garrett-marcin-hammett combination pull off some genuine thrills and surprises here, thanks to the inventively forceful direction by mamoulian, the atmospheric photography by lee garmes, plus remarkably sharp film editing and flawless special effects. brilliant acting helps too. coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hayseed-turned-fearless bootlegger (the sort of character progression he was to repeat in other roles such as sergeant york). miss sidney (pictured center) in her first major role is also an eye-opener. the principals receive great support from paul lukas, wynne gibson and stanley fields as the heavies, and even from robert homans' hard-as-nails detective. the movie has obviously been realized on an extensive budget which is brilliantly deployed in its realistic, crowd-filled sets.
