"the china syndrome" could not have been released at a better time: twelve days after its release, the infamous screw-up in three mile island happened. but even if that (and/or chernobyl) had never happened, this movie remains an important look at what could happen through mismanagement of nuclear facilities. jack lemmon turns in a five star performance as the supervisor trying to expose a cover-up at his nuclear plant, with jane fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate, and michael douglas plays her cameraman.<br /><br />i don't know whether or not the current threat of a terrorist attack makes "the china syndrome" more disturbing, but either way, it's still definitely a movie that everyone should see.<br /><br />i hope that those people who spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just so that they could know that their views and ideals are completely defunct.
