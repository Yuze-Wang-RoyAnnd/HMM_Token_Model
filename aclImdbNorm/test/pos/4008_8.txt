i watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. it provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. they are also the official broadcasters of e3 and comiccon. if you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. they have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). it's the only place that i get my tech info. kevin pereira and olivia munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... universe. if you know those universes you will understand the jokes. long story short, aots is a hilarious show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything that you care about. i'm watching it right now as i type this, they are 'in' san diego covering the red bull air races. sweet.
