yes, i know, roscoe arbuckle didn't like to be called 'fatty', but i couldn't resist the joke.<br /><br />this is a fine lloyd hamilton short from his peak period, directed by roscoe. the two work together with lots of good gags and roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show ham as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.<br /><br />this story plays with some interesting themes, like lloyd's classic move along: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.
