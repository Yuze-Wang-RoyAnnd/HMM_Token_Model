an egotistic major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in japan, he contends with a culture that is alien to him, an apparently humorless manager, an attractive japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurities. there is a certain subtle charm that flows through tom selleck's performances. there is humor, sometimes softly understated, as in this film, sometimes slapstick as in "folks!", but always there seems to be some higher purpose involved. throw in an individual full of self doubts who struggles to solve his personal difficulties while holding fast to "doing the right thing," and you end up with a film both funny as well as thought-provoking. the cast fits together like a championship team, and even if neither cast nor film win awards for their efforts, they will leave the viewers feeling good (and maybe that's the best results after all). you'll want to watch this film more than once, and each time, mr. baseball hits a home run.
