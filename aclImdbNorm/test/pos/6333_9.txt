having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential, when i heard that it was becoming a tv series, i flatly refused to watch it. my best friend became a rabid fan immediately, and knowing my love for horror movies, could not believe that i wouldn't watch a single episode. i told him that the movie had scarred me for life as far as anything buffy was concerned, and he told me to forget that the movie even existed. he insisted that i give two episodes a shot: "once more with feeling" and this one.<br /><br />both of them are why i am a buffy fan today. he was right - i was hooked immediately. i have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue, and nothing else could've pulled it off with the panache and the pure creativity of buffy. i think x files might've gotten away with it if they'd thought of it first, but i'm glad that buffy did it instead. <br /><br />it is a credit to everyone involved that you are riveted for the entire hour, sometimes hanging onto the edge of your seat. and when it was all over, i craved to know more about every character. so i went out and bought the season one boxed set. and the rest is history...<br /><br />i guarantee you that if you've never seen it, either, you'll want to see more if you make this episode your first. <br /><br />the only reason i'm not giving it 10 out of 10 is because i'm reserving that score for "once more..."
