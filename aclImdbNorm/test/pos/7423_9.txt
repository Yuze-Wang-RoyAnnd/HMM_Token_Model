one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time, 'terry & june' was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70's and '80's.<br /><br />it started life as 'happy ever after', but when eric merriman decided he didn't want to write any more, it changed into this, hence the dropping of 'aunt lucy' and the fletcher's becoming the medford's. <br /><br />yes, it was cosy, domestic, middle-class stuff; the plots ran the gamut of clich'es from the boss coming to dinner, the vicar organising a jumble sale, and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend. it was certainly not 'dreadful lazy comedy'. as for it being 'not clever', it was not meant to be. it was funny and well performed, and that was enough! <br /><br />i too loved the 'alternative' boom of the '80's ( 'spitting image', 'black adder', 'the young ones' etc. ) but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this. if nothing else, it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to. i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill. well, family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens, but where has it left us? take a look at the latest t.v. schedules. all soaps and reality dross. the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers, meaning they are jam packed with swearing, bodily function jokes, and explicit sexual references. and they are not remotely funny either.<br /><br />the 'alternative comedy' boom was good in many ways, but had a dark side. it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned, drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan, and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as 'little britain' and 'tittybangbang' ( heaven help us ). if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
