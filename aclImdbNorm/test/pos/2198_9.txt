"sweeney todd" is in my opinion one of a few "perfect" musicals. like "my fair lady" and "west side story" it has a wonderful, intelligent score. it offers the two leads and several supporting characters interesting roles. it has a timeless theme, revenge. it has a good deal of humor, and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a grand scale.<br /><br />"sweeney todd" tells the story of a simply wronged man during the industrial period in england. it shows mans' inhumanity to man, how in sweeney's own words, "there are two kinds of men. there's the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other one's face." in an effort to correct the wrong that was done to him, mr. todd devices a plan to seek revenge. with the help of mrs. lovett, who owns a meat pie shop under mr.todd's barbershop, they set out to have "those above, serve those down below".<br /><br />i was fortunate enough to have seen the original broadway version eight times (six with cariou and lansbury, the other two with hearn and loudon). i saw the revival with bob gunton and beth fowler, and several other concert versions.<br /><br />while the technical aspects in this production are lacking, to say the least, i believe that this filmed production version is the best. lansbury and hearn were the two best in these roles, and they have a wonderful time playing off of each other.<br /><br />very good supporting work by ken jennings and edmund lyndeck. although betsy joslyn and cris groenendaal, as the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry, and are basically unwatchable.<br /><br />9 out of 10
