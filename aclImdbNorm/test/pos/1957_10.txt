after reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. what is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. life goes on. it is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. these are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. we all went to school with kids like these. we are being numbed by fiction-/movie-/tv-/news-based reality/invention.<br /><br />feck's (dennis hopper the great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie.<br /><br />there have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film. amen.<br /><br />
