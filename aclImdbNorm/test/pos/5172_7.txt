even if i had never seen or heard of georgetown, co, this would be a sweet little movie. but my dad was born and raised there, and those are my uncle's horses you see pulling the sleigh! so this movie is very special to me. a lot of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses i recognize, and are very realistic. the story is a little hokey, but georgetown is that kind of magical place where things like that could happen. john denver was a better actor than a lot of people give him credit for. mary wickes plays the kind of "common-sense lady with a lot of sass" she played so well in many other films, most notably "white christmas". i usually don't get to go out there in the winter, so i like to see this movie at christmas time to "tide me over" until my next trip!
