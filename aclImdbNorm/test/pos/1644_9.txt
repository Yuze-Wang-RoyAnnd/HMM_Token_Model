a true stand out episode from season 1 is what ice is.an artic location,claustrophobic conditions and a general feel of paranoia looming in the freezing air makes this is a must see episode from season one.the previous occupants of the artic station mulder,scully and four others go to have either killed each other or killed themselves.a virus is bringing out murderous aggression and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fear.mulder and scully actually begin to question each others sanity.tension is that high.the writers have to receive great credit for creating that sort of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense mulder and scully come into conflict in such a direct manner
