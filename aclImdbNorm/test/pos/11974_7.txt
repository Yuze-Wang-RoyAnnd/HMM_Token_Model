i would consider myself a fan of dean koontz; having read a number of his novels and liked them all, but unfortunately i never got around to reading watchers so i'm left with no choice but to rate this film on it's own merits rather than comparing it to the book that i haven't read. i went into this expecting something awful, and while i didn't exactly get a brilliant horror film; i am lead to believe that it's fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in it's own right, watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie. the plot obviously takes some influence from predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab. it's not long before a rancher is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man's daughter has picked up an ultra-intelligent runaway dog. a secret government agency is soon on the case, as the murders continue. the boy continues to be fascinated by the dog's intelligence, but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail too.<br /><br />the script for this film was originally written by paul haggis, who later disowned it. i don't know why
