i watched sea of dust at the rhode island horror film festival in providence. it was the festival's featured film and won best picture out of i think a couple hundred entries. the director and a few of the stars answered questions after the showing. one star, suzy lorraine, was even hotter in person than in the film, and she was an eye catcher in the movie.<br /><br />this film is independent, yet it has a lot of cinematic touches that give it a quality feel. it even has an original classical style musical score.<br /><br />i am a savini fan and he's the star villain here, in black cape, he's more of an evil force than a real person i think. he is sucking the souls out of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the kingdom of god on earth. in his view, christ was all about suffering and savini intends to make everyone suffer.<br /><br />the main story line that holds your interest is about a young doctor, stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events savini is causing in an isolated town. he proposes to an aristocrat chick on the way but her sob father tells him to get lost. then he meets up with a strangely possessed but alluring country girl. i think she falls in love with him, but she also tries to kill him, as do a number of hot women in the film.<br /><br />i found the scenes shot in the woods to be the creepiest and most eye catching, with strange people along the road (the evil little twin girls scared the hell out of me).<br /><br />the film has a lot to it, too much to list. there is a lot of blood, torture and gore. hot chicks licking blood off of guys' fingers. a terrified girl's head explodes. that was unexpected. throats get slit. some brutal stabbings.<br /><br />then they play it for laughs sometimes, poking a bit of fun at the whole evil black forest genre.<br /><br />if you're a fan of hammer films and ingrid pitt, it is fascinating to see her in this movie. she offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull. excellent. the guy who played "multiple miggs" in silence of the lambs is great in an axe fight.<br /><br />the movie is surreal and with the ending, i'm not sure the events happened or if they were in stefan's head because of his rejection by his would-be fianc'ee. he returns in vengeance and that scene is brutal.<br /><br />the director also talked about the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings. i can see that for sure, savini's view of religion was scary.<br /><br />this was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like savini and pitt, a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes, great gore scenes, action, and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next.<br /><br />this deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent film effort, i don't think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget, and yet they managed to make something really attractive, unique and thought provoking.
