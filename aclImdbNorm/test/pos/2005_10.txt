eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. this movie shows a good aspect on the human body being god's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of adam and eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. actress/model inger ebeltoft's impersonation of eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and i can't imagine having another actress being eve. this movie to me, comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief. we'd never fell so relax then before from watching this movie. this movie is a masterpiece, god supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place!<br /><br />mr. razbin!
