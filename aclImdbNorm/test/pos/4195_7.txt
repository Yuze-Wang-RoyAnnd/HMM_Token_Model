you would really need to remember the monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie.<br /><br />there is no plot as such. basically, it's a crazy, mixed up pastiche of various, unrelated sequences. but, it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength. in short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema. it contains some good songs, some ultra-groovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique.<br /><br />i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons. first, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time. if a feature movie flops at the box office, the consequences can be dire for all concerned. secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. and, finally, as already mentioned, it is, unquestionably, a classic of the genre and, as such, it is now historically important.<br /><br />unfortunately, "head" came too late in the monkees career. but, there again, they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image. <br /><br />clearly, the members of the group knew, only too well, that the whole monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project. in a way, it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. they were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years. in short, they "wanted out" and they were going to say a few things before they left.<br /><br />history, however, has vindicated the band. let the critics be damned. the monkees, left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. yes, they had plenty of help. but at the end of the day, they stood in front of the studio mikes, they fronted the movie and tv cameras and they did the concerts. they were fun and just a little bit crazy. but, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt.<br /><br />"head" probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles "hard day's night" but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its significance.<br /><br />enjoy!
