i have heard an awful lot about 'the english patient' and i finally decided to get the cd and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. what i found out was a cinematic delight and should, i repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. if you are a religious, moral zealot, i am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. as i remember correctly before i watched this film i read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who i quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. when it comes to morality i agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. <br /><br />i must admit rarely have i seen such a wonderfully crafted film. i keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. first and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. instead let's focus on how the story was told. it's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. its set in the world war ii and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (count almazhy played wonderfully by ralph fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (juliet binoche) in war torn italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). the burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an english woman katherine (kristin scott thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war africa. the past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. the locales in the desert and in italy are beautiful and so are the characters. i am a romantic and am not ashamed to say i had tears after it ended. watch it with someone you truly love. the movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. the sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of innocence. <br /><br />anyway it deservedly won a bunch of oscars and i will go hunting for other works of director anthony minghella.it kind of brings back the romanticism in the david lean genre of films.it almost reminds me of 'lawrence of arabia' which was also based in the desert.happy viewing folks.
