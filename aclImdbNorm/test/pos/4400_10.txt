having seen most of the coen brothers previous films i expected something different and slighty off centre. obwat is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as mississippi. it is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.<br /><br />characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. george clooney winning me over completely with his clark gable-ish looks and character. having only ever seen him in three kings and his thin red line cameo, i am now a fan. more comedy please george.<br /><br />john tuturro and tim blake nelson ably assist, especially nelson. if ever "the simpsons" is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play cletus the slack-jawed yokel. i don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. my special favorite is stephen root as the blind radio station man.<br /><br />great old-timey music, a jiggy type dance by clooney that i am trying to learn, and a feel of depression era southern us enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie i've see so far this century. the only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack, the dvd and a dvd player to play it on....it's that good!<br /><br />
