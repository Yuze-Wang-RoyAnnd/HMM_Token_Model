"the chipmunk adventure" is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980's. alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me, since they were what really got me into rock and roll. neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits. alvin's really the star and has all the cool looks. theodore is the lovable sensitive one. then there's simon (my personal favorite), the smart one who is often a party pooper. i also like the chipettes a lot. there's brittany, who, like alvin, is one who is always trying to be so popular. then there's eleanor, who, like theodore, is sweet, sensitive, and loves food. janette is the only chipette who is not much like her counterpart; she's very naive and really clumsy.<br /><br />in the chipmunks' very first full-length movie, david seville is going on a business trip to europe, and he's leaving the boys with miss miller while he's gone. while playing an arcade game, alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money, he'd race brittany around the world for real. unbeknownest to the kids, a man named klaus furschtien and his sister, claudia, who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, overheard this conversation and said that they'd let them race around the world for $100,000. alvin and brittany accept it and go on the race.<br /><br />this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs. "off to see the world" made for an appropriate theme song for the movie. then there is "getting lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "my mother" is most likely the sappiest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "wooly bully" is the only cover song used in the movie (the rest were completely original). then, of course, there's "the boys and girls of rock and roll", which, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history.<br /><br />i used to watch this movie very often, until my recorded tape of it died. i still watch the movie, though. this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time. it'll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you'd expect out of world travel. definitely one of my childhood movies, and one that i'd recommend to 80's fans and alvin & the chipmunks fans.
