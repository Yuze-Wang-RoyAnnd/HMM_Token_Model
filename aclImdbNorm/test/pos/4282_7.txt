i gave it a seven only because the acting is good. and of course by that i mean wilkinson. the other two principals were "decent". but the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character wilkinson played (james manning)? i didn't see him behaving like the martinet emily watson accused him of being. bill bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who i was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. who was i kidding? tom wilkinson isn't paul bettany after all. so what on earth did emily watson's (anne) character see in him???? she herself admitted he was pretty much a piece of offal in his treatment of her. why would she even want to be in the same town as him, to say nothing of the same "room".<br /><br />i noticed some other reviews, one person said she "cried" at the end, to witness james' tragedy. ??? what tragedy? what, you mean losing an imbecile who finds someone like bill bule amusing???!!! give us a break.
