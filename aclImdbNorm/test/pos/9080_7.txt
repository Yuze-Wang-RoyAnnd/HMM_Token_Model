nostalgia isn't always the best reason to watch a movie. more often than not, the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult. while there are exceptions to this rule, it's hard to justify owning a dvd of krull, regardless of how many insightful the director's commentary may be. but stay sharp gen x/y'ers, because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane, might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting.<br /><br />one surprise film worth another look is joel schumacher's flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn heavyweights keifer sutherland, kevin bacon, julia roberts and billy baldwin. you would think that a stew comprised of this cast, the flamboyant flair of schumacher and the "uber slick eye of cinematographer jan de bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy, but calories aside... flatliners ain't half bad. even though it's production design is inexplicably over-the-top and the photography is achingly over- stylized (replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam), flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller. if there's an explanation why flatliners was forgotten, it might be because 1990 saw the release of another, far superior, supernatural thriller: jacob's ladder.<br /><br />had flatliners been released a year or two after jacob's ladder, it's likely schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down, commercialized rip-off of adrian lyne's nightmarish masterpiece. but with these films being released in the same year, flatliners enjoyed a different fate, tripling jl's take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise. the passage of time hasn't been as kind to flatliners, it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80's brat pack dreck, while jl has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. fates aside, jl is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame, whereas flatliners falls victim to over- simplification and hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement. comparisons between the two movies is unfair, and ultimately overlooks flatliners ability to represent the 80's at its quintessential best. released at the end of a decade of shallow excess, flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness, it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at (or at least near) the top of its particular heap of dreck. for intents and purposes, it's an entertaining walk down memory lane.
