"the aristocats" is classic disney at it's best. it's not considered as the ultimate disney classic along side the more well-known disney-films, but it's a well-made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a disney classic. "aristocats" is certainly a sure kids-pleaser, cause it has all the components for a fun kids film. i'll liked it very much as a kid. i'm not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults, who could watch disney classics for the nostalgia sake, but i still enjoy this film as an young adult.<br /><br />storywise, "aristocats" may not be so complex or innovative, but it doesn't matter. this film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa, which "aristocats" certainly shows. the characters make the film; they're all likable, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling (eva gabor as duchess, phil harris as thomas o'malley and etc). a misconception could have been the dogs napoleon and lafayette, since they're showstoppers and haven't so much to do with the actual story, but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold.<br /><br />"aristocats" is both entertaining and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. the animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's french surroundings (especially the city of paris looks greats). the character animation and design is great. and the songs are really catchy too. my favorite is "scale and arpeggios", but the title song is a cute song, along with "thomas o'malley cat" and the memorable show-stopper "everybody want's to be a cat". and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations.<br /><br />overall, "aristocats" is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. so what you're waiting for? do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids. it deserves to be in their memories.
