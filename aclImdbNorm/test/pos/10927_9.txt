i just watched this short at the planetout movies. <br /><br />starcrossed was a very sweet, sad, little movie about two brothers that are in love. there is some great, subtle acting from both the male leads. often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story. luckily writer director james burkhammer does not do this, and instead lets the story play out with honesty. the sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet.
