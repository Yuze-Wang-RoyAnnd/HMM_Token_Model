this film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971.<br /><br />clint eastwood, geraldine page, and elizabeth hartman do excellent work in the film, as do all the cast members.<br /><br />set during the civil war, the film begins when a wounded yankee soldier, johnny, portrayed by clint eastwood, is given refuge and help at a girls academy located in the south.<br /><br />the headmistress of the school, ms. farnsworth (geraldine page), the one teacher-edwina (elizabeth hartman), and a small group of half grown girls have been without a man in their midst for perhaps a little too long.<br /><br />while their loyalties lay with the confederacy-- their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction. johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win the women over to his side--and keep them from turning him over to the patrollers.<br /><br />however, feelings previously stoked by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, a brutal rape, and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousies--turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both johnny and the school's residents.<br /><br />10 stars
