after working on 7 movies with director mickael curtiz (the adventures of robin hood are their best achievement), errol flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great raoul walsh. this reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. the died with their boots on is their first and best film together. raoul walsh portrays the general george armstrong custer (errol flynn) from his debuts at west point, to the civil war and finally at the battle of little big horn. it's true the film shows a too heroic portrait of custer, but that's not important. what is important, is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. who can forget california joe, the great "queen's own buttler" with his song "garryowen", the touching mrs custer (olivia de havilland), the diabolic sharp well played by arthur kennedy ?<br /><br />an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso.
