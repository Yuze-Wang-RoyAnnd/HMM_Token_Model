i've read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark. i've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. de niro is in no way murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. in fact, part of the comedy of this film is de niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.<br /><br />murphy really shines in this one. he is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. rene russo is also great as the tv producer. of course, she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard (along with murhpy) to get deniro going too.<br /><br />a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner, reprising his role as tj hooker to train murhpy & de niro how to "act" like cops. but, my favorite scene involves murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a wesly snipes-like cop to team up with instead of de niro. man, that was hilarious! comedies often depend on your personal tastes. sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. i was psyched to see the pairing of murphy and de niro...i think it brought out the best in murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro. rating 8 of 10 stars.
