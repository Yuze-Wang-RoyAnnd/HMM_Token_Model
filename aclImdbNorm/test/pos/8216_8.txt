this movie was suspenseful and fun to view. as i am a fan of these type of movies, i did enjoy this. the premise is kind of scary but the fact that i didn't rate this a 10 was because the movie was a little over the top in some areas.<br /><br />spoilers:<br /><br />cmon:nobody could identify this girl? i understand the concept of isolating oneself but i find it hard to believe that somebody-anybody wouldn't have been able to id this girl as angela bennet. that was over the top and so was the scene where she walked over to somebody's desk and started typing. this was overall a really good movie, suspenseful and keeps your interest. dennis miller was great as allen, really believable, bullock was good as the lonely reserved computer worker the bad guys all underestimated.<br /><br />i think the premise of the movie was really different-and scary. in today's times who knows what could happen? but some of the over the top scenes prevented this movie from being a 10. 8 of 10.
