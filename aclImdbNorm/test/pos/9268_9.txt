i saw this documentary film at the 2005 slamdance independent film festival. this documentary is shot, directed and edited by a son (craig) of his mother's year long battle with cancer. shot over the course of one year "the closer she gets", is a documentary in the truest form and gives you an inside look of a family's struggle with battling with the cancer, the viewer gets an inside point of view of the effects cancer has on a family as well as the individual throughout the entire process. i have never seen such an honest film, this is a powerful and raw film, and since it wasn't shot by an outsider you get the true emotions of everyone involved. many documentaries are shot by an outsider, but having this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film, unlike any i have seen before on this subject or any other. this is a touching story that everyone should see, and can relate to. i would highly recommend it.
