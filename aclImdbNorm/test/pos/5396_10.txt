some may think imaginary heroes is a movie exactly like "igby goes down" but it isn't. in imaginary heroes, the director lets us feel for the travis family and the people around them.<br /><br />the movie itself is great, and the acting is extremely well done. weaver's and hirsch's acting is believable and helps make the movie what it is. the actors, director/writer, dan harris, has made a movie that many people should see. don't think this is just another teen movie, it is a movie about a family and their problems.<br /><br />i gave this movie a 10/10 because i believe it isn't the best film, which no film can be, but its the closest it can get to perfect.
