what you bring to the movie influences your view of it. i brought 30 years in the air force to this, and every time i see it i am moved by the ending. would a youngster of 15 who's spent their life flying in jets feel the same way? yet, i can only just its impact on me. <br /><br />jimmy stewart gives a wonderful turn as--jimmy stewart. considering he was a pilot, and an air force reserve general, he probably comes as close to being an expert on how a pilot would act as any man alive. one can't fault his delivery, or his acting. he is a pilot being a pilot, that's enough.<br /><br />---spoilers---<br /><br />it's the final minutes of the film that continue to grip my heart. lindbergh has been flying without radio communication and has no idea if anyone is even expecting him. when he flies into the paris airport, the uncertainty of the landing field draws you in. what is it below? those shifting circles that look like cobblestones or a field of corn, must make you wonder, is he in the right place? they go on and on, streaming past his vision until he gets low enough and see that in the paris night, what he was seeing was the light of the city reflecting off the upturned faces of the thousands of people waiting for him to land.
