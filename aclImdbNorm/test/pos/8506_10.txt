i like both this version of dorian gray and the mgm version. both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with dorian (this is not in the original book), and that is my only complaint. i especially like angela lansbury as sybil vane and george sanders as harry in the mgm version, but shane briant as dorian in the tv-version is much better looking (i think) and far more ruthless than hurd hatfield in the mgm version: i think briant is more true to the novel's dorian. in the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even hints at dorian's liaison's with men, as does wylde, which could not be done in the mgm version).
