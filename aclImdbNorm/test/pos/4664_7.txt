under the assured direction of f. gary gray, "italian job" never loses its grip on being cool and fun. although the material is rehashed and average, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfyingly good. the tone could easily have been much heavier, considering the murder-revenge plotline but f. gary gray keeps the tone light by good humor, snappy dialogs and pulsating music. it is a pleasure to see these would-be-bad guys form a great bond and stick to eachother through deceit and murder, while never forgetting to have fun. this one is 7/10.
