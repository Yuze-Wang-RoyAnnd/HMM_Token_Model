as listed and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. indeed, more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted, it is still watched, and watched again, and has a huge global fan-following, something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right.<br /><br />the root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters
