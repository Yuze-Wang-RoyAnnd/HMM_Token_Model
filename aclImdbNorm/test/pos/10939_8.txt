i watch a lot of vampire movies. i know vampire movies. hammer films have always been my favorites. christopher lee will always be the best dracula. <br /><br />vampire effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end. the dubbing is not great, but i also like godzilla movies, so i am used to badly dubbed movies. anyway, i liked this movie very much. the sfx are great. even though jackie chans part in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the movie, he is enjoyable in it. the fang work is excellent. the acting is not great, but this could have something to do with the bad dubbing. maybe the actual language would sound better with the movie if i could understand it. i am sure the movie gone with the wind sounds worse in another language.<br /><br />i own this on dvd and would not part with. i have it sitting on my bookshelf next to my hammer films dvds.
