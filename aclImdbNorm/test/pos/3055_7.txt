the movie is not halve as bad as people want to make you believe it is.<br /><br />what is the reason why so many people hate this movie? is it because it's laurel & hardy's last one together and it's not their best? or is it because of the lack of laurel & hardy regulars? or because it's not made by the hal roach studios or 20th century fox? <br /><br />definitely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive laurel & hardy and bring them to the '50's. it's also definitely true that the movie is far from their best but honestly, the movie still entertains well, making this movie also far from their worst. not the most worthy 'goodbye' movie imaginable but an entertaining and suiting goodbye nevertheless. both of them retired from movies after completing this one.<br /><br />the movie still features some great slapstick moments and the chemistry between laurel & hardy is obviously still very much present. it also makes this movie better than most of their movies together from the '40's. quite a surprise that the slapstick humor still works out as great as it does, considering that the days of slapstick comedy had been over, ever since the '30's.<br /><br />the story is perhaps not as entertaining as it could had been and it features too many sidekicks and characters, with as a result that the movie looses its focus on the boys at times. a shame, because they are still the ones that really carry and make the movie.<br /><br />sad to see in what poor form stan laurel was at the time of making this movie. he really looked ill and old, which he also of course was. he was well over 60 years old already. but after a surgery he fully recovered and still lived for another 15 years, before dying in 1965, 8 years after his good friend oliver hardy.<br /><br />an entertaining, though not perfect goodbye to the boys, laurel & hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous, quality slapstick entertainment of movies that are still being watched and loved by people all over the world.<br /><br />7/10
