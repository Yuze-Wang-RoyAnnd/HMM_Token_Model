although it might seem a bit bizarre to see a 32-year-old woman play the part of a 12-year-old, mary pickford soon makes you forget the incongruities and simply enjoy the fun.<br /><br />mary is a street kid in new york city, with her own lovable gang of mischief makers, whose attentions are engaged by the older william haines (he was 25 at the time & just on the cusp of his own screen stardom.)<br /><br />to give away too much of the plot would not be fair. suffice it that mary is great fun to watch & amply displays why she was hollywood's first and most beloved super star. production values are very good, with lots of extras making the nyc street scenes quite believable.
