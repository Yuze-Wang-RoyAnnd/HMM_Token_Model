michael polish's hypnotic "northfork" is a film that will stay in one's memory for quite a long time. this exquisitely crafted movie that michael and mark polish wrote, is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. the movie is splendidly photographed by m. david mullen, with a haunting score by stuart matthewman.<br /><br />if you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.<br /><br />the idea to set the film in montana was a great coup for the polish brothers. never has the majestic views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in "northfork". we don't need any color! the beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the desolation in this remote outpost.<br /><br />at the center of the story is irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious father harlan. this boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body. but is he really there at all? we watch him interacting with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery. there are two freshly open graves. will one of them be for irwin? <br /><br />at the same time, another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. we see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can. this will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created. their reward is one acre and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of people.<br /><br />the third story line centers on the mystical group composed by flower hercules, cup of tea, cod and happy. they are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area. when irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers to help, only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. we watch as the quartet examine the feathers the boy has placed among the pages of his bible. could irwin be that angel? <br /><br />the closing sequence show us all parties leaving northfork in different directions. the men in black riding their automobiles, perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties given to them as a reward. the mystical group is seen boarding a plane and taking off for a higher place. we also realize that the child in father harlan, in spite of the medicines and the care he received from the saintly figure, has died.<br /><br />michael polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals. nick nolte, as father harlan turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man. james woods, as walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a fine job. the biggest surprise is duel farmer, who makes an excellent impression as irwin. this child actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise.<br /><br />the mystical group is brilliantly acted by daryl hannah, robin sachs, ben foster and anthony edwards, the man with the funny spectacles. peter coyote, mark polish, ben foster, and the rest of the cast are flawless under mr. polish direction.<br /><br />the beauty of the film relies in its simplicity. mr. polish's vision will haunt one's memory. the images of montana, as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in american films in quite a while.
