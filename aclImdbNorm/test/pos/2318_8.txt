i really enjoyed this movie. i have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. being an old navy guy, im still stirred by the rousing rendition of anchors away! i also love the "mchales navy" pirate atmosphere. i could have done without the female dive officer but im just old fashioned i guess. she was still good to look at, lol, espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. the cook, sonarman, and electrician made the movie. loved the salty old engineer and his first class po too. and grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit officer. i loved the "driving scene" as they passed the golf course on the way into port, lol. pure navy! and i swear i had an xo that was just like that little weasel... im am so glad this is out on dvd, about bloody time. :0)
