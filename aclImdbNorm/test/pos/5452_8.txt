tv movies generally do not receive as much recognition or credit as great films - and it is usually for good reason but the 1996 hbo movie the late shift is easily one of the best tv movies ever. based on bill carter's revealing book, the late shift is about nbc's handling of late night talk show hosts david letterman and jay leno when it came to filling the vacant tonight show seat once held by johnny carson. we see what happens in front of the camera - author bill carter, director betty thomas, and hbo show us what happened when the cameras were turned off.<br /><br />unfortunately we can never really know for sure what really happened when it came time for johnny carson to be replaced by either letterman or leno - but the late shift gives us an interesting possible reality. while simply being a very well made film, the late shift also does a really good job of portraying all the sides fairly equally - although you wonder if the film makes letterman and leno out to be too nice of guys; especially leno, who seems a bit too saintly.<br /><br />the performances are also very good. in a very deserving golden globe-winning performance, kathy bates plays leno's extremely pushy manager helen kushnick who, according to carter and the book/film was very problematic for the studio and leno (the real kushnick actually suited bill carter for libel over this portrayal!). john michael higgins breaks out of his usual gigs of getting small quirky comedy parts and gives an excellent performance as david letterman - giving an excellent impression of letterman but also creating a dimensional and relatable character. daniel roebuck gives a good performance as leno but does not quite measure up to some of the other talent in the film - roebuck probably did the best anyone could have done, it is just looks hammy whenever anyone tries to do an impression or portrayal of leno. bob balaban (a squirrelly warren littlefield), treat williams (a magician-like michael ovitz), and ed begley jr.(a pompous rod perth) also give memorable supporting performances.<br /><br />the late shift certainly is one of the best made-for-tv movies i have ever seen. i suppose if one has not watched david letterman or jay leno, the late shift might not be for them but it is an interesting film for those who get into the late night politics - something that has recently reared its ugly head yet again with the 2009-10 conan/leno/nbc debacle.
