this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering. the acting wasn't the greatest, i'll admit that, but it was passionate about it's message, sending people into prisons without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual. they even had a damn trial for saddam, so why doesn't every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were tagged in the first place? i'm getting off the movie, but i think it's worthy to note about this sick, twisted idea the government has. the movie's way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery. the whole movie, i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and it's made very obvious in the end. there's no doubt that the directing was incredible, but the one thing i didn't care for was that there wasn't as much emphasis on reese witherspoon's character's interest and fight in the ideal she held, a lot of skipping. otherwise it was actually quite entertaining, and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played.
