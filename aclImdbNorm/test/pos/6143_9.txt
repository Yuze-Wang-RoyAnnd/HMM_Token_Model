i was surprised to read the comments of the person who so disliked this film. it really is quite funny. there are definitely a few laugh out lines that my boyfriend and i quote to each other. some of the situations might be unsettling (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly strange child's view of sexuality) but believable at the same time. it's about communication and miscommunication between men and women.
