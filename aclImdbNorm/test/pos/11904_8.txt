this movie is the latino godfather. an unlikely mobster bridges the gap to some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. i enjoyed the action and gunfights along with the brash acting and colorful characters. this movie is no oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. hey, who needs an oscar anyway? <br /><br />chapa has got some balls to direct& act ( i think he produced it too?) this movie. reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do it all, robert rodrigez. keep it up, is there a sequel in the works? there are a bunch of strings that need to be tied. son comes back and avenges dads death?
