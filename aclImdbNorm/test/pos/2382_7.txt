good job.that's how i would describe this animated scooby-doo adventure.this is so far the best of the animated scooby movies i have seen.i liked the story.i thought it had some depth to to it.the movie is also well paced.it doesn't get boring for a minute.it also has an interesting group of characters(besides scooby and shaggy and the gang,of course)plus,the movie was a real blast.i has a lot of fun watching it.i also liked the great scottish music.it was very catchy and infectious.naturally,we know that scooby and the gamg will solve the mystery,but it's still fun getting to that point.the animation is also pretty good for this movie.i would love it if they did a 3d animation scooby adventure,but we'll just have to wait and see.for me,scooby-doo and the loch ness monster is a 7/10
