the three names that mean the most to this film are burt reynolds, mark wahlberg, and julianne moore. these three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. the film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise. on the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, i think there was some overkill in this department. paul thomas anderson has not done a great deal of directing, but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work "the dirk diggler story." one thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together. although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other. the wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage. there are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.<br /><br />the story is about a gifted young man named eddie adams (wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry. he changes his name to dirk diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight. jack horner (reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. however dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything. although a greater focus is placed on the character dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. you will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve. all-in-all a well done film.
