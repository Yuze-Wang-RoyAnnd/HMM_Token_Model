i saw conrack on a night i couldn't sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia ! this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the carolina's is a great advertisement for teaching , and for simply helping each other .set in the early 60s , with the civil rights issues , viet nam and all that came with the 60s ,it is forgotten that the peace corps and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the unprivileged .conrack with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people , and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power's that be .the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers !! its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves ,maybe , hopefully .see this film .
