...our the grandpa's hour.<br /><br />more than the gangsters ,it's a detailed depiction of an american family circa 1930:the father,proud of his job who worries about his son who's given up high school,the mum everyone would like to have ,the daughter who forgets dinner time in his squeeze's arms,and the twins who are absolutely lovable ("don't go to sleep first ,please!").<br /><br />and there's the grandfather ,playing the yankee doodle on his flute .have you noticed that this tune plays the same role as doris day's "que sera sera" in hitchcock's "the man who knew too much" (1956)?and there's this grandpa who is finally the most courageous person of the family .so old he does not even tell you his age ,but proud of his country and resisting to the gangster's hateful blackmail.<br /><br />a good film by wellman.
