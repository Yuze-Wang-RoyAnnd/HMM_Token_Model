a lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of paris hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie. the reality is that paris has a fairly minimal part, she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen. the film also makes fun of her on several occasions, usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision. for those who enjoy paris hiltons stage presence, this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video, because at the screening i was at, we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a "woman of questionable values".<br /><br />the movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks), it has everything a good horror should; a creepy villain, excessive violence, acts which make that average person cringe...this movie hit all the bases. it is definitely worth a watch.
