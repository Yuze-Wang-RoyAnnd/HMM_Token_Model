this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly. each of the three "teenage girls" offer their own believable, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa. if one looked beyond the superficial "action" that was taking place, keith's character treated lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and consideration. the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion. david boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle. dialogue was sharp, quick and flowed nicely. the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled. although the movie appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, human emotions and desire.
