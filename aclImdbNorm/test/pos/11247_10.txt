i'm sure all of the canadians on imdb are all too familiar with canadian content, and how much of it is... well, shall we say, lackluster. there are a select few canadian shows that are actually worth watching, however, this is definitely one of them.<br /><br />simple premise. two guys picking up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, add in some witty and clever commentary from a group of surprisingly likable self-proclaimed "alpha males" and you have yourself some very entertaining programming. each episode is solid. if the "players" are sub-par, there are some awkward moments to be had, and there is some gentle fun poked at them. if the "players" are good, it leads to moments that you just have to stand up and applaud, and some comical praise lavished at them.<br /><br />the premise is kind of trashy, i know, and as a guy who usually takes pride in the fact that i'm elevated himself above typical, terrible reality television, it takes a lot for me to admit that this show is actually funny and enjoyable.<br /><br />one thing that must be pointed out is how the comedy network did a terrible job marketing this show. for the longest time, i didn't even know the premise, and all i knew was that there was somehow a shirtless guy who "loves cougars" involved. however, after actually watching the show, i was surprised by how surprisingly slick it looks for canadian content (despite a pretty lame opening credits sequence). so give it a chance. i have yet to find someone in the target demographic (18-30 year old males) who have actually watched the show (and not just the annoying commercials) who hasn't liked it.<br /><br />bring it back for a third season, comedy network. it actually has a good premise, as opposed to some other canadian shows you've had (cough*girls will be girls*cough). i usually reserve 10/10 ratings for "works of art," but i just have so much fun watching this show and i think that it has been unfairly judged my many, that i just had to.
