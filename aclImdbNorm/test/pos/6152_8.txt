this feels as if it is a czech version of pearl harbor. it has a same story, both guys fall in love with the same woman. and add to the twist, the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year. i don't think that the story line is too strong. the younger guy is quite naughty, that is cute. it kept me watching because of the emotional music, and the pleasing scenes one after another. it also has some strong visual special affects. best of all, the love stories is seamlessly integrated with the story. <br /><br />i think that if it was in english, it would be such a big shot all across the states. it is too bad that not that many people are open for foreign movies.
