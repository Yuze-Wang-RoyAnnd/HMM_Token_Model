i believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of lb8000 but that didn't really show. there wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of aberdeen. the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and uncharted planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each-other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive. there weren't any great explanations of what was going on, which can be really contrived, so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like the big empty which was a film i also enjoyed. i found that i quite warmed to most of the characters, there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments, the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film's climax and ending were quite poignant. i think mr stirton and his crew should be quite proud of themselves i've seen worse films with a budget of millions.
