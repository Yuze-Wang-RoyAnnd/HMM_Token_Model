going into this movie, i was a bit cautious. i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies. i've always enjoyed decent animated movies, but claymation was always different to me. but this one caught me by surprise. wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. there's the silly burp/fart jokes for the kids and the subtle, but over the head of young kids, jokes for us older people. very neat claymation and while the story had holes, it kept my interest beginning to end.<br /><br />it's so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days, this movie was all the more refreshing. wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing, which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin people's vegetable crops. but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps can't even keep under tabs. great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun. if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit, i highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />the only reason i rate it a 7 and not higher is because it's still a family movie and i don't have kids. i enjoyed it, but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife, it'd be at least a 9 for sure! give it a shot!
