if you have ever seen a bollywood movie, you know they are longer than most movies due to the multiple song and dance routines (each one is over five minutes long). fortunately, this one has fewer song and dance routines and fits into the "standard" movie length. don't get me wrong, i like bollywood movies, but tend to fast forward through the song and dance portions. i bought this dvd because i am an ian bohen fan. although his role wasn't as large as i hoped, he still had a good amount of screen time. and his character was much different than his other roles.<br /><br />overall, this was a good movie. like most bollywood movies, there is at least one element of controversy/conflict of the traditional indian culture. but true love triumphs over adversity and a happy ending is had by all.
