this zany film rivals the ghost and mr. chicken as one of don knott's finest film performances. knotts is an accountant for a podunk city hall that is good for swindling the citizens. they fire the "three competent bookkeepers and keep the dumb one" (knotts of course is the dumb one). when his garbage collecting cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash can, knotts finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. funny moments in the movie include the bowling alley restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious. typical knotts, the nervous ninny act is well used, and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties. such actors as frank welker, and pitt herbert add to the mayhem. as one may expect knotts's armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue of what he's doing. fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about anyone will love it.
