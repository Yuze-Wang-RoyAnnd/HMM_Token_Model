i came across this movie while channel surfing one day; and decided to give it a chance. to my surprise i enjoyed this darkhorse movie. i felt some genuine chemistry between challen cates and malcolm-jamal warner. it was such a lighthearted and warm movie that when it was over i felt upbeat. sure, this movie was predictable from the very beginning, but i give it high marks for the way that it made me feel when it was over. i must admit that i have never seen challen cates before, but i feel that she can definitely act. when you combine her good acting with her cute face and attractive figure. she has the makings of at least becoming a well-known star.
