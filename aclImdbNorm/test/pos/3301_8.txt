watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale, i was floored by joan crawford's first appearance. all i could think initially was, "my god, it's the same face as michael jackson in his notorious booking photo!" <br /><br />about 34 minutes into the movie, diane baker and hope lange get out of a cab in greenwich village. as they walk down the street, you can see part of a sign in back of them for the stonewall bar -- scene of the epochal "riots" that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement.<br /><br />speaking of baker and taxis, i had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie, "56th and sutton place, please -- and be careful of the bumps." can you imagine the reaction to that from a driver in today's manhattan?! she says that, of course, because she's pregnant and doesn't want to hurt the fetus. but that doesn't stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she finds out bob evans wants her to have an abortion! well, they had to find a way for her to lose the baby (1959 and all).<br /><br />sue carson is delightful as mary agnes. why was this her only movie? there is no biographical information on her in imdb.
