a refreshing black comedy starring some of australia's finest. in the same way that lock stock and 2 smoking barrels captured the funny side of london gangsters, two hands rips through the sydney underworld. it wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone.<br /><br />an australian classic. if australia could pull more rabbits like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on.
