before seeing this film, i suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator. there have been many films about crime victims. this one is about the murderer.<br /><br />"dead man walking" finds realism in simplicity of the story: there are no crack lawyers coming to save william poncelet and no dramatic story twists. the film does not attempt to put him in a good light; he is guilty, he is repugnant, is a racist, and was responsible for heinous murders. given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a human being despite his crimes. in this way, the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides "justice". whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption, inequity in the justice system, and the appropriateness of the death penalty.<br /><br />great performances by both susan sarandon and sean penn. in particular the last moments of the film show the true depth of penn's ability.
