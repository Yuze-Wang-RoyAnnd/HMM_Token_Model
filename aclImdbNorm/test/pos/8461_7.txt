christine lahti (sandy dunlap) and mary tyler moore (holly davis) worked well with soapish material, ted danson did his best with a thankless role of chip davis the premise of this that the two ladies' friendship, one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking. i found the relationship that ted danson's character had with the single woman played by christine lahti's rather sordid. he behaved in a caddish way, yet he left two "widows" pining over him, bawling. i found it revolting when when sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife, he calls her saying he misses her (did he call his wife? there was no sign of that). he behaved like a heel. it perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off. perhaps both ladies would have wised up and dumped him. i liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common: the cad of a husband.
