"pixote: a lei do mais fraco" deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all brazilian themes: poverty. and along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder.<br /><br />brazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. the difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decay.<br /><br />"pixote" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that, like pixote himself, is already lost.
