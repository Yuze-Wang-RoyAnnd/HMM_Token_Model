"valley girl" launched nicolas cage's career and was an 80's version of "romeo and juliet." it is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. nicolas cage, deborah foreman and elizabeth daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top "fast times at ridgemont high" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for "fast times," then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. that's for sure.
