a sign of what to expect in this film came when i spotted that this was the first (and probably the last) film to have in its credits a "vomit technician".<br /><br />in what is a couple of hours of silly gags, hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humour.<br /><br />this film was just what you'd expect from the bottom boys, and it is great to see them back in their best form after rik mayall's life threatening accident.<br /><br />richie (mayall) and eddie (edmondson) are too similar to their bottom characters, if we can have any criticism at all, and edmondson does a surprisingly good job in directing the film also.<br /><br />this film has already spawned the predictable comparisons to fawlty towers that just aren't there, and the guest house paradiso itself is hardly torquay!<br /><br />watch out for some excellently crafted dialogue amongst all the violence and mayhem.<br /><br />if you don't like bottom you'll probably hate this - but i loved it.
