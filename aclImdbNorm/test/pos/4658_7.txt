somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells a song plays in my head. i can't forget it no matter how hard i try. it's midnight madness and it's gonna get to you! wish i could find a copy of this on a 45rpm record. five disparate teams head out one night in l.a. for a scavenger hunt for clues instead of physical objects. an unkempt game-master with two gorgeous assistants is the mastermind of all this insanity that's about to be unleashed on l.a. all the teams are stereotypes (this movie being from 1980, before political correctness screwed everything up): the "good guys", the "nerds" led by eddie deezen, the dumb beer-loving "jocks", the "we-don't-need-a-man-type ladies", especially the redhead. the giggling twins are a scream, too. and finally, the "bad guys" with stephen furst as the leader. furst is hilarious as the overweight slob harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess. movies like this aren't made anymore. these days, movies have to have an "edginess" to them with some dark characters and other nonsense. go back to the days when the "good guys" led by david naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted. so dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980. it's midnight madness . . .
