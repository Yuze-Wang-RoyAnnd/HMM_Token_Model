this movie is an evolutionary piece - from terminator to robocop .<br /><br />stan winston did the spfx !<br /><br />in this film, a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss(they always are) gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body .<br /><br />the rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this cyborg/man regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife, played by the gorgeous(back then in 1986) terri austin . (he tries to reconnect with his old life, like in that scene in robocop)<br /><br />the rest of this movie is about breaking things, while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill-defined 'turn humans into cyborgs' project .<br /><br />this film pays homage to previous movies like the day the earth stood still - - as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot gort does .<br /><br />except for the 'frankenstein suite' designed by stan winston, this movie's production values are typically canadian: sleazy ! ! <br /><br />pam grier stars in this film as an hired killer-commando, a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the 80's .<br /><br />as for a sci-fi horror b movie, out of 4 stars, this film ranks about a <3
