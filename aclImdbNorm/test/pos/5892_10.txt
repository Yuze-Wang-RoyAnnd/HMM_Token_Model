best years of our lives is a film that slipped under my radar for years--i had heard about it, but never had the opportunity to watch it. thanks to tcm on demand, i was able to watch it uncut and commercial free.<br /><br />what surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war. the film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. it manages neatly to encompass nearly all the varieties of war experience within three characters.<br /><br />we have the air force officer, who was a veteran of the early european bombing campaign. because of the horrific attrition rate amongst the crews of the bombers, the air force at that time had a reputation for cranking out officers who quickly rose through the ranks. such was case with this fellow who went from a lowly soda jerk in civilian life to a captain and bombardier of his b-17. he also suffers from ptsd, called "battle fatigue" at the time.<br /><br />we have the army non-com who served in the pacific, and suffered through the horrors of that campaign. his story is opposite that of the air force fellow in that he goes from a prestigious job as a banker to a lowly grunt in the army and rises to the rank of sergeant. from the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of sergeant, yet he is still on the front line.<br /><br />finally we have the navy seaman, who is part of the faceless support staff, commonly referred to as remfs (rear echelon mfers)by the fellows on the line. ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below decks on a navy ship, his ship is struck, presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with loss of 400 lives. he is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks.<br /><br />byool tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home, and how they readjust into civilian society.<br /><br />what impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists, it never descends into melodrama. the navy kid, played by an actual amputee, is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him, yet the script never lets us feel that emotion. the army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points that out, but never dwells on it. the air force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in (now bought out by a large chain) and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife.<br /><br />the script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights, but it neatly avoids that. but for the overly dramatic score, the director has tread around exploiting the obvious.<br /><br />in one scene that well represents the entire movie, the daughter of the army sergeant (frederic march) is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the air force captain. despite his marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled. now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. later, mom shows up, consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom, and everybody lives happily ever after.<br /><br />in byool, this scene plays out completely differently than the clich'e i have described above. sure the conversation gets heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog i have seen.<br /><br />ultimately, byool is a highly satisfying film, with honest performances from the entire cast. technically, it is well shot, the editing and cinematography frame, but never overshadow the gripping narrative. despite the score, which is clich'e and over-dramatic, i give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves
