saw the film at the closing gala of the ealing film festival in west london(england). enjoyed it immensely. although the crow & the chinese policeman don't appear, and dan milligan becomes dan madigan (played by sean hughes (i)). the interaction between dan and the author (writer/director) voiced/played by lord richard attenborough, works very well.<br /><br />the rumour is that lord attenborough and elliott gould (as dr. goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.<br /><br />spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.
