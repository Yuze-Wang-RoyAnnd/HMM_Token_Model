after all these years, i am puzzled as to why julie brown (west coast) isn't a household name or a hugely famous comedic star. she is one of the funniest females on the planet. in this spoof, she takes on madonna who is one of her favorite targets. she is medusa, a hugely successful singer, like madonna who also happened to have documentary "truth or dare." julie brown spoofs madonna as medusa who came from wisconsin, the land of dairy and beer. i remember the segment where she went to wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. i don't remember if it was a parent or her pet. i remember somebody saying that medusa did nothing original. she was just copying others. i have to say that i hope this spoof documentary is available on dvd somewhere. julie brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others.
