why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics? random hearts, directed by the brilliant sydney pollack (who has a small role in the film too) is another harrison ford vehicle. as such, it is quite good and entertaining. surely, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind, or read the book which is no better. even kristin scott thomas fans, myself included, knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her eldest uncle. even as such, the film is satisfying. what's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other (much higher rated) harrison ford vehicles? this film is no masterpiece, but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe.
