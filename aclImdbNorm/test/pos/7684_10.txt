when is art going to overcome racism? i believe the american people have grown up since this movie was made. porgy consists of a stellar cast and music. this motion picture is an excellent adaptation of a great opera. i.e., miss saigon is based on madame butterfly, les miz is based on a classic book. recently, an opera has been introduced here in los angeles, based on the movie the fly. an opera!! so be it!! <br /><br />disney is hesitating about releasing song of the south. the naacp has voiced no contest for race issues, and let us not forget amos n andy was a huge hit in the 50's as a tv series. ethnicity is our heritage in the u.s., and we should embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /><br />please release 'porgy' on dvd !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />j hartz
