sui generis. folks, i'm not going to lie to you; merhige is a one or two hit wonder, but what a film (it almost excuses suspect zero). i'm also not going to pretend to understand it completely; half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro.<br /><br />richard corliss says, "it is as if a druidical cult had re-enacted, for real, three bible stories -- creation, the nativity and jesus' torture and death on golgotha." that's not a bad description, but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly one-to-one religious correspondences.<br /><br />there's an environmental theme right up near the surface -- note that toward the end (after the barrenness of the landscape) there are large pipes not unlike those on a construction site. oh no, he's going to say look at how people are raping mother nature. one rarely sees a dead metaphor in action, and with this much hyperbole, but to see it acted out is way grislier than language implies.<br /><br />and yeah, if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack, it does have the requisite atrocities. but as for myself and others like me, it's an important art film that should merit a criterion collection release. ranks right up there with murnau's faust.<br /><br />~ ray
