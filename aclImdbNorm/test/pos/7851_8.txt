i was amazed about this early performance of clint eastwood. i had not read a summary of the film, when i decided to watch it on tv. due to mr. eastwood, i expected some nice shootings and no deep story. i was quite mistaken. i found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed, and until the end, i couldn't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad. this movie is definitely not typical eastwood, but surely worth watching.
