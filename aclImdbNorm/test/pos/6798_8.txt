mickey rooney (as mi taylor) is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin, where he meets 12-year-old elizabeth taylor (as velvet brown) - she adores horses, but he has a sad history with the animals. ms. taylor is enamored with mr. rooney's horse-sense; she takes him home, and gets him room and board with her family. they are supported very well by anne revere and donald crisp (as mr. and mrs. brown). butch jenkins and angela lansbury are taylor's strained siblings.<br /><br />the plot of "national velvet" is implausible to a fault; for example, the circumstances leading to taylor's ride in the "big race" are quite a stretch (but were likely more believable on paper). still, the characters' connection to horses, and to ms. revere's character are nicely conceived. rooney and taylor are excellent in the starring roles; there is a balance between rooney's fading "child star" and taylor's exuberant new "child star", which adds depth to their characterizations.<br /><br />the excellent performances of rooney and taylor are further enhanced by fine direction, photography, and editing from clarence brown, leonard smith, and robert kern. a sentimental classic. <br /><br />******** national velvet (12/14/44) clarence brown ~ mickey rooney, elizabeth taylor, anne revere
