the great news is that this film is now available on dvd from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video.this is good news as it is one of my favourite films!<br /><br />i watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is compulsory holiday viewing. living in the small market town called tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions,of reenactments,and traditions we are also a cosy tight community. we are now also faced with large housing developments which threaten to destroy the community and you can see why i love this film first of all-and most important, there are lashings of snow!!!! then there is the lovely legend of the christmas tree and also the christian denouement as all the community cough up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community. the evil developers-only after the money are sent packing as the whole town pledge their money to help protect what they have , which is very special. i love the way the whole community send their message to santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero . he and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (there is a likely candidate for this)-even a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on christmas morning and no-one had engineered it! there is a lovely moment where denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. great gentle film for everything christmas is really about.
