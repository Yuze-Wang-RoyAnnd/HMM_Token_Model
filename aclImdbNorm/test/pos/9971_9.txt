i just saw this at the toronto international film festival in the beautiful elgin theatre. i was blown away by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least, the bravura performance of al pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from jeremy irons.<br /><br />the film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty, law vs justice, and passion vs reason. some might protest that the content is inherently anti-semitic, however they should consider the historical context of the story, and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation.<br /><br />9/10
