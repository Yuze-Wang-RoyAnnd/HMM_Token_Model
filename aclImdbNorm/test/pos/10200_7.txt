this western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union. while nice guy dean jagger (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons. so, it's up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day.<br /><br />this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8--it was that good. however, for the life of me, i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about westerns. his forte was drama--and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts--just set in the old west. strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job.<br /><br />as for the rest of the film, it's exceptional--with vivid color, great location shooting and very good acting. as usual, randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance. i was surprised, though, with robert young being also cast in the film, but it was a good casting decision--he was supposed to be a harvard-educated easterner. when i saw barton maclane was also in the film, i pretty much assumed he'd be the "baddie" and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career out of playing jerks! as for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i'd hoped--making this movie ending on a very high note.
