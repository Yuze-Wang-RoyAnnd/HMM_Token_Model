because mr. bean almost never speaks, i heartily recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause/play button. at the end of any age group's lesson, simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the dvd, encouraging students to shout out the answers to "what's this?", "what will happen?", "what's happening?", "what's wrong?", or any other question that elicits responses from that lesson's new vocabulary and grammar.<br /><br />because everyone's looking at the tv, normally shy students become vocal. because the dvd can be started or stopped at any point, it's a perfect "filler" for the awkward "between" times while students are leaving and arriving.<br /><br />i tried other dvds, notably "tom & jerry" cartoons and red skelton dvds, but no others were as good as "mister bean" at holding students' constant attention.
