a precursor to "citizen kane" in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon, here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks. in spencer tracy's 15th film he already looks middle-aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young!<br /><br />a little silent-screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable, well-written drama.
