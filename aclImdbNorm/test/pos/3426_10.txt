the truth and reconciliation process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa. i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process. almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. we all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. what's happening in south africa should guide us all. i found it credible, moving and at times upsetting. there were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative. once again the bbc has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie.
