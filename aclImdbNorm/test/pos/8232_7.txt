after cleaning up dodge city (with a little help from wyatt earp) bat masterson goes to liberal, kansas where they've got a nice little range war going. plus a rather interesting scheme of sharecropping.<br /><br />randolph scott is bat masterson and he's after villains billy house and steve brodie who are driving homesteaders off their farms. the homesteaders they are driving off are in a sharecropping scheme financed by robert ryan. seems as though he's staking the various farmers to a parcel of land to homestead for a percentage of profit from their crop. ryan's about to lose his shirt as a result of all the shenanigans.<br /><br />as portrayed by scott, bat masterson is a stand-up western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter which we all know he did later in life. <br /><br />anne jeffreys and madge meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving brodie and ryan which is a little silly and does detract from the action. anne jeffreys does sing nice though.<br /><br />of course gabby hayes as always provides the great comic relief.<br /><br />a good addition to the randolph scott collection of westerns. also interesting because his later western films don't have him as wearing a hat as white as the one here.<br /><br />this review is dedicated to kasey hayes of the professional bull riders who is a proud resident of liberal, kansas, a town with a great tradition whether bat masterson marshaled there or not.
