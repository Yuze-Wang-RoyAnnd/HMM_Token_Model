when i heard there was to be an abc [australian broadcasting corporation] mini-series based on life in changi [wwii pow] camp... with a focus on "elements of comedy", i was deeply sceptical and somewhat critical.<br /><br />my father had served in the second world war. such was the barbarity of the japanese, he was able to talk about the horrors in and around labuan (where he was stationed), until only quite recently. along with my father, i had been awarded the fortune of knowing many great men (of stronger character and spirit than i shall ever have), who had witnessed acts of unspeakable barbarity at the hands of the empire of japan, and had never completely recovered. the name 'changi' is destined to conjure horrific images for ages to come...<br /><br />but upon viewing, i was highly impressed with the cast, the characters and the complex plot-lines of this wonderful series. i now regard 'changi' as the highlight of my week, (bear in mind, i have viewed only three episodes so far... i hope the remaining episodes adhere to the standards set by the first three).<br /><br />the black humour works uncannily well (however, the flatulence jokes are a little overdone), and while much of the horror has been suppressed, the series comes quite close in relaying the undaunted spirit of the survivors who were able to later continue with their lives in spite of the inhibiting memories.<br /><br />the 'flashback' format of this series will be difficult for some to follow,<br /><br />but i can not think of no better way to do adequate justice to the men who suffered deep emotional scarring proceeding internment... when painfully suppressed experiences are remembered, sometimes years after the horror.<br /><br />one of the darkest chapters of the second world war, the 20th century, and, (i would go so far as to say), in the history of mankind, is being relayed to a new generation through this series, and i hope it serves to relay the overwhelming adversity borne by the wartime generation.<br /><br />proceeding 'changi', i don't think i shall ever be able to listen to the poignant tune 'on the road to gundagai' in the same way again. tune in...
