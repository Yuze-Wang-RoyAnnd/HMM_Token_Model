two city guys are driving through hicksville usa when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road.having picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker,they pull up at a truck-stop full of redneck amputees,one of whom warns them of 'the demon out there'. but they don't listen.big mistake!"monster man" by michael davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well.the film borrows heavily from "duel","the blair witch project","jeepers creepers" and "the texas chainsaw massacre".the story is pretty silly,but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy.i enjoyed especially the performance of justin urich,which offers the film its comedy relief.still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive.give this one a chance,if you have some time to waste.7 out of 10.did i mention that aimee brooks is sexy?
