"blind spot" one of my festival favorites. i was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. the cast is great. james franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from los angeles. his journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. the film has a powerful style. it pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. it also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love. there is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension. strange. suspenseful. beautiful to look at. definitely worth seeing. i really would like to see it again. periodically i check to see if blind spot has been distributed. i can't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on dvd.<br /><br />davide pepe 13/08/2005 bologna - italy
