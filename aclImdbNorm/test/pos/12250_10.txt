not only do i think this was the best film of 1987, it's probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best films i've ever seen. for whatever reason, i really connected with this movie, and it is one of the most personal films i had seen at that point in my life (i was 26). for better or worse, i strongly identified with the holly hunter character (and i'm a guy!). she plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who couldn't figure out romantic relationships. there were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that i would say or have said to others in similar circumstances. and the ending of the movie i find to be so very, very sad.<br /><br />obviously, this role was the big break for holly hunter. clearly, i was not the only one to think so highly of it.
