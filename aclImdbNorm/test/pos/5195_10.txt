one of the best war films i have ever seen, if not the best. it is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made. the "problem" is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides. this is for the reason that this film unlike the most of hollywood films doesn't glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters. instead of that, the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti-war as much as the reason can offer. extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting, most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces. also, german army is played by germans which is so convincing as well. the film is produced and realized by germans where you can see their love for details to perfection. this is the reason why "stalingrad" is one of the films i can watch million times and never feel dull. i watched the film with my father who fought in wwii and the first thing he said was: "this is like real, this is how the war against germans looked like". this is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of wwii: stalingrad.
