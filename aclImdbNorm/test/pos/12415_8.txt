two college buddies - one an uptight nerd, the other a rude slob - embark on a road trip through the country. on the way, they encounter a vicious vehicle that looks like an army tank combined with a monster truck, that tries to run their car over. they escape it, but only enrage the mysterious and dangerous driver more when one of them takes a leak in the top hatch while at a rest stop. later on, they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who ends up getting involved in their life threatening situation. monster man is an extremely entertaining horror-comedy that has some good suspenseful moments as well as some good gory ones. the two lead characters and their constant bickering is fun to watch all on its own and the end takes a tcm-like turn which was very well-done. absolutely worth checking out.
