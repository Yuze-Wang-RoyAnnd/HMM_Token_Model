one of the best and most inspirational movies about a different culture i've seen in years. tragic and touching. worth the watch. maybe a few times. we all know how brutal children can be. i know from my own and my brothers experiences as children and this movie hit the nail on the head. perfectly! the kite running is amazing and i need to do research on the validity of that event. even though it is done in cgi it is still amazing and very interesting. to maneuver a kite like that with a single string seems impossible but they make it believable. anyway this movie has many twists and turns that are, i'm sure to many, probably easy to figure out but they hit me before i could. which makes a great movie for me! when you figure out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes it kind of ruins it. but this one does it so smoothly that it's hard to guess it even when it happens...i'm a guy and i don't mind saying that the tears were flowing at more than one point in this movie.
