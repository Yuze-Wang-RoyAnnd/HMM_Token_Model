reading the other comments here at the imdb, i had very high expectations before seeing 'angels of the universe'. i wasn't disappointed, and giving the movie an 8, i would say that i can justify that grade.<br /><br />the movie has some incredible acting, especially by the main-person, pall. the supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution, the parents and the siblings of pall. the music is also worth mentioning, supporting the movie throughout, giving depth and feeling.<br /><br />although the movie is very scandinavian, it doesn't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about pall's life. still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light-weight, this is not for you. it is a story about people with mental problems, about the way they are being dealt with in society - but most of all, a story about pall.<br /><br />i recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs. it is one of the best movies that has ever come out of iceland, if not out of scandinavia.
