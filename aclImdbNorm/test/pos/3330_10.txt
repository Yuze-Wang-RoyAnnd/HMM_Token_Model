this animated short is a remake of one of tex avery's earlier shorts for fred quimby at m-g-m (dog gone tired). an escaped convict (here just known as joe)who just broke out of 'alka fizz prison' tries to keep one step ahead of droopy (known here as sgt.mcpoodle of the mounties),but always manages to run into him,one way or another. this is easily one of the most side splitting,funny shorts that rolled out of the m-g-m animation studio. it manages to get most of it's laughs from the shocked reactions joe has whenever he encounters mcpoodle (including some equally deranged sound effects-i.e..car horns,screaming,elephants,etc.). as with any avery m-g-m short,frantic,kinetic pacing is to be expected (along with some nice, surreal sight gags-i.e.joe trying to run away from mcpoodle & actually running off the side of the film). pop this one into your dvd player & laugh yourself silly.
