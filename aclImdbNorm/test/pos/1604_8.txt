contains spoilers<br /><br />luchino visconti's film adaptation of thomas mann's novella is visually, if not philosophically, faithful to its source (britten's opera offers a more faithful reading of the apollonian/dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer). it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made.<br /><br /> in the visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story. never has venice looked more beautiful and alluring, more decadent and effete. if you've read the novella, it's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life. dirk bogarde gives an outstanding performance as gustav von aschenbach. although he has very little dialogue, he conveys the bitterness, aroused passion and finally, pitiful yearning of aschenbach through facial expressions alone. bjorn andresen, the young actor who plays tadzio, the beautiful object of aschenbach's desire, was perfectly cast. he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures. the tadzio character is pivotal to the story, so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. visconti, with his incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. and changing ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on gustav mahler, and then using mahler's music, especially the adagietto from the 5th symphony, was another brilliant stroke. although i'd read the mann story before the film, mahler's music and death in venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film, especially that last one of ashenbach dying on the beach as tadzio walks slowly into the sea.<br /><br /> one day this film will be released in dvd widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us.
