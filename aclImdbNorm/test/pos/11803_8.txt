"the cure" is a very touching and poignant drama. the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. one of the boys has aids. the boys become good friends despite erik's apprehensiveness at first. the film shows the boys journey to discover "the cure", which is in ohio according to "the national examiner", and how it affects their relationship. the acting is wonderful (i have never seen annabella sciorra do better), and the movie is just plain touching. i couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene. this is a good tearjerker. keep the kleenex nearby. 8/10
