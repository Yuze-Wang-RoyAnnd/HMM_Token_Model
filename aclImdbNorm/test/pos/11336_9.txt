having seen many of wong kar-wai's other movies (happy together, fallen angels, ashes of time), i knew what to expect coming in to the theatre; the cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the acting would be superb, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness. these are, after all, precisely the techniques that make wong kar-wai's art what it is. what i was not expecting was the degree to which i was drawn into a film that some reviewers dismissed as "unfinished" and compelled by characters who "seemed consumed by ennui."<br /><br />i find it interesting how people can be so utterly unmoved by a film that so vividly displays emotions and settings many of us take for granted or work ardently to forget: the overwhelming sense of grief stemming from being betrayed; the guilt aroused by the thought of becoming no better than the betrayer; the mundane yet profoundly intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express oneself verbally is utterly superfluous. this is what wong kar-wai attempts to portray in the film and what he achieves so well.<br /><br />too many americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock dialogue; witty banter, disaffected sarcasm and overwrought confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the "best" american film has to offer. wong kar-wai sees things very differently. instead of the character needing to keep the audience apprised of her every feeling, perception or belief, wong's characters make their feelings and understandings known clearly by facial gestures, body positioning, and, yes, silence.<br /><br />if viewers merely contemplate this film from the standpoint of character development and action, then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer. if they are willing to let themselves try and intuit what the characters are feeling, then they may feel quite differently about what wong has to offer them.
