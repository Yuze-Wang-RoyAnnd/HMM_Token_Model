the stark, cold landscape of big sky country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains, is put to poetic use here in this lynchian fable/slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented polish brothers (who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating "twin falls idaho"--a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be siamese twins). a little orphan boy is dying, and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress (in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant). with its eerily pleasing music score, minimalist dialogue and character development, and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels, the polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about, the moving pictures...the images, the scenes...paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid. this is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep. the fact that all of this was done on a shoe-string budget of less than two million dollars puts hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the polish brothers in the future.
