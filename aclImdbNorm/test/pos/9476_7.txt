it's fun to watch a young james cagney doing his thing. he plays the cheapskate weights and measures guy who takes his job very seriously, stepping on the toes of a group of crooked politicians. he is offered the world, but keeps his integrity. he is beaten and set up, but that's the problem. we never know if he is really in danger. they say he's in a spot, but still seems to have carte blanche to move around and do what he needs to do. at times he's so cocky he doesn't do much to protect himself. his allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt. he perseveres (almost too good to be true), of course, and we pull for him. the problem for me is a lack of sustained suspense. it would have been much better if he had had to clear his name. he never drops into the depths, even when rejected by his wife to be. it's still fun with the bad guys kind of imploding. see it just to watch cagney do his tough guy posturing.
