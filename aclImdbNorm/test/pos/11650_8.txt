this was the most thought-provoking capital-punishment movie ever! it refused to seem one-sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get. this movie had one of the most 'human' (and i use this term in a good way) compassionate religious character ever! this movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book (which is rare for me). sister helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious(which is also rare). and it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out. and we have the director to thank for that. this is not a film for entertainment. but it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart. i can't think of another film like it.
