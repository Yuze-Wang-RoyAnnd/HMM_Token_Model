a bright youngster interested in "serious" music (admittedly a vanishing breed--who'll play the fiddle when no one can play the violin??"--could find this an interesting fiction about street kids and great musical stars. heifitz was indeed the greatest violinist of his generation and the film gives him a rare on-screen chance to display his technique. the kids, especially gene reynolds, are fine and, all in all, the pic is a good example of first-rate studio family fare of the late 30's. it doesn't hit the top of the great '39 list, but it's a nice way for an intelligent family to spend a rainy afternoon with amc or the video store--- good luck at blockbuster!!!!
