the best thing from the american pie "bakery." i found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the american pie movies to date. .also concerning the appropriateness of the content i found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous american pie movies. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. when the movie first came out i read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...i now regret that decision. the movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialog/scripting, and overall quality. i give it two thumbs way up!
