jack webb's movie 'the d.i' came about from the real life investigation into the deaths of several trainees in a swamp in paris isle in the 50's. as always, webb, being the patriot that he is, came to the defense much like all the rest of his shows. i actually found this movie tame by 1957 standards. i served in the army and can understand the intensity of the training at parris island (camp death by some)so this movie can never come close as does 'full metal jacket'. i think this is a good movie which is more patriot than it is actual. but again, think of the time period it was made (1957) and what could be allowed and said on film at that time. i have always found jack webb to be clean cut and very loyal. i know many have criticized the film as one-sided and government propaganda. if you feel this way, watch 'full metal jacket' with r lee ermey. i am a webb fan and enjoy the movie for it's merit, not accuracy. as i have said, webb believed in this country and held institutions to high moral standards (lapd-dragnet,adam 12, emergency etc). just sit back and enjoy this one from a very strict moral time period in this country. don't be too judgemental of mr. webb. mark lockwood lubbock texas..
