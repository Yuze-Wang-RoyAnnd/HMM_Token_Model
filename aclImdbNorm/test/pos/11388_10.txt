this picture's following will only grow as time goes by. better than any of the best picture nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated viewings. i've seen it three times now so i know. anderson was compared to some of the great american directors (altman, scorcese, tarantino) and he may have those influences but chances are, after a few more films, he'll be considered part of that short list himself.<br /><br />one last note: julianne moore's "amber waves" will resonate in the memory long after other 90's movie characters have faded. the best performance of the year -in any of the four categories.
