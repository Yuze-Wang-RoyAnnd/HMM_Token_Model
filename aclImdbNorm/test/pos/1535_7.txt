this two-character drama is extremely well-acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments (shocking not because they are graphic, but because you're not prepared for them when they come). but eventually it does become oppressive, just like the somewhat similar "a pure formality" did. still, alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt about it.
