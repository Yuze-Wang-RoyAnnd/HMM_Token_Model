how is bear's paw, elephant's trunk or monkey's brain for dinner? let tsui hark tell you in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy about the art of cooking the traditional(?) chinese way.<br /><br />this movie shares the common structure of an american sports movie, but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking which makes it all the more interesting. i even think leslie cheung's character look a lot like charlie sheen in major league...<br /><br />this movie also contains a bit of zhao wen zhao vs xiong xin xin fighting (love seeing more of that after the blade) and a quite funny in-joke concerning a leon lai pop song...<br /><br />perhaps not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian though.
