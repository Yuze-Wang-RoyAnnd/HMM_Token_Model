between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumour, zachary scott made 70 films. he was introduced in 1944 in jean negulesco's 'the mask of dimitrios', where he played dimitrios. the next year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. he is best remembered by cineastes as the star of jean renoir's 'the southerner', one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. however, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money. so what happens here? he lives in a house with three women, so watch out! faye emerson, who also appeared in 'dimitrios', plays the older of two daughters in the house. she falls in love with scott and they become secretly engaged. then her 'cute kid' younger sister (played effectively by mona freeman, who resembles bonita granville both in looks and in behaviour) returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with scott that she has inherited a tidy sum, so scott turns his sights on her instead, with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse. things get tense, and then they get tenser. meanwhile, plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating scott. but it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. he is also being searched for as a result of his last kill, with which the film has opened, so that we know his back story. james wong howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale, which was directed by frenchman robert florey who had moved to hollywood some time earlier. the film is an effective psychopath-in-the-house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats, for those of such an inclination.
