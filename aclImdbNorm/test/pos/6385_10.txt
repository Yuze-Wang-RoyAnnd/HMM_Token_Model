i loved it. others have revealed spoilers, but i won't. it was an unusual premise, actually sort of weird, but i went along with it completely. camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. but i think sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly - without being maudlin or ridiculous. i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco, but married him anyway. i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job. he has nothing to be ashamed of. there have been movies with with similar setups e.g. "ghost". i simply love sienna miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated, and hope it becomes more recognized by the public. i thought all of the actors played their parts very well, and hope more people get to see the movie. i highly recommend it. i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available. i definitely plan to buy it.
