i saw the messiah:- the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes i have seen, ever. it was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, i cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. jamie draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is jez clifton, the cop. to be able to do that, well, i certainly wouldn't be able to do it, well not without cracking anyway. i really do love and care for jamie draven with all of my heart and i always will, until the end of time, i think that jamie is the sweetest, cutest, sexiest guy in the world. i absolutely love jamie in ultimate force also because he looks god damn sexy in the blacks that he wore. i love jamie love paula draven<br /><br />-x-
