excellent performance. there still are good actors around! also great directing and photography. very true to shakespear, and a 'must' for all shakespear fans. macbeth (jason connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. if you love death and decay, and shakespears lyrics... this is the one.
