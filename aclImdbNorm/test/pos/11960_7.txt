it's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy john cusack comedies made by savage steve holland, and while i prefer there other more bizarre, out-there flick, better off dead, it's hard for me to dislike one crazy summer, a movie i grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens. ocs was a follow-up to better off dead, returning cusack and curtis armstrong from that film. <br /><br />cusack is hoops, following graduation pal joel murray(george)to nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach. hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde, buff punk named teddy beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. one of the homes, needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to demi moore(cassandra). there's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving cassandra's grandfather's home(..he had recently passed), but it has been won by teddy over the past many years, and hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water. but, with the help and motivation of newfound nantucket friends(..such as bobcat goldwait and tom villard as auto-mechanic twin brothers!), george, and budding love-interest cassandra, perhaps hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky, manic weapons salesman, general raymond(..sctv's joe flaherty in an inspired bit of casting), ack, who uses the training from his father to assist hoops and company in their goals to win the race. <br /><br />memorable scenes include bobcat getting stuck in a godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire model of aguilla beckersted(mark metcalf, barely recognizable as teddy's rather unhinged pops)'s condominium, hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid, george a victim of toxic flatulence, bruce wagner's nutty uncle frank's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show, and the wonderful billie bird as george's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal! jeremy piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with teddy and causes trouble for hoops and his posse, the yummy kimberly foster as cookie(..teddy's girl who attempts to make-out with hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father), and the one-and-only william hickey as old man beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race. demi moore is cute, but this is cusack's vehicle, though bobcat and villard steal most of the scenes their in. again, some delightful animation from holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(hoops is an artist, appropriately). if you like his movies, i highly recommend the underrated, how i got into college.
