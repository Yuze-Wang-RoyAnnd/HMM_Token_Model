this movie is about viola (amanda bynes) and her quest to beat her school cornwell boys team after they kicked the girls team out. so she goes to the rival school illaria and joins the boys team, in doing so she falls for duke (channing tatum) who thinks shes a guy and likes olivia (laura ramsey) who likes viola as a her brother. <br /><br />i was in a version of the 12th night play and the beginning was very modern. so i knew the play well. i was very exited about seeing this movie and when i saw it it exceeded my expectations. it kept a lot of my favorite lines and i could see big connections to the play. though it was like the play it was not as complicated. it was also more of a chick flick than i expected but it was good. it was very funny. it pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies. you saw how viola (amanda bynes) thought wrongly about what guys thought and her complications in living in a guys world. you also see her room-mate, duke's(channing tatum), impression of this. i really liked seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way. it also tells the modern theme "follow your dreams" but this time it has a twist. i think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved soccer and stuck up for herself and her family and her dreams. i think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars.
