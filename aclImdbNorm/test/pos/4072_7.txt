this is a funny movie. the bob & eddie show feel of it could lead to a sequel but i doubt it will make enough money. <br /><br />deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of cgi animals and rodents. rene russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.<br /><br />some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. this was worth seeing in the theater. we needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end. do not leave at the start of the credits!<br /><br />at least a 7.
