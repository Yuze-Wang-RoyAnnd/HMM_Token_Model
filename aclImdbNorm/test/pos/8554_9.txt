i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night. it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later, because of the important real-life lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature. and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii, it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe today.<br /><br />if you thought "ethnic cleansing" as it's called today, has anything to do with race or ethnicity, you'll think differently after viewing this story.<br /><br />i guess i'd been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules. evil is as evil does.<br /><br />this movie teaches a valuable lesson, and i recommend it especially to e.g. church groups or civil rights organizations.<br /><br />i don't expect it will be too easy to find and rent, but i'd really like to see it again, because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of "race expertise". in this scene, the protaganist, who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war, is "discovered" by an ss race authority, and ushered into a room. there the two play a sort of guessing game, where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero (anthony quinn's character) came from -- and where his ancestors came from. well "come to find out" that quinn's character isn't a member of an "inferior" race after all, but to the contrary, he's a perfect, archtypical aryan! which doesn't mean a whole lot to quinn's character, who is more interested in talking about the towns, rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming... nevertheless, being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks. among other things, he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags, and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms. yeah, it's a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes... until the allied armies arrive, and recognize his face from magazine covers.<br /><br />
