a sparkling movie. bb is a marvel. she's sultry. she is a feminist. she is still very much in love.<br /><br />the movie features paris in the 50's. it is wonderful to look at the sites, the cars (ds!) and orly.<br /><br />a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy. the music is horrendous. it almost dissonates. on the other hand it is hilarious. but it is probably the only thing amiss, at least looking at it with 21st century eyes.<br /><br />the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity. it is that sense modern. a movie like un elephant se trompe enormenent did it in an 80's way. but the basic premise stays the the same.<br /><br />thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity.
