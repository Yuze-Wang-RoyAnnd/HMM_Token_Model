"broadcast news" is directed by james l. brooks (terms of endearment, as good as it gets) and has a great cast, including william hurt, albert brooks, and holly hunter. everyone gives a good performance, but they're all too unlikable to really care about them.<br /><br />some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as the prologue, and the short scenes with jack nicholson. the main reason it doesn't entirely work, is it's a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them.<br /><br />you could consider it nothing more than a drama, but it's often too silly to be successful there as well. still, the script makes it worth a watch. certainly not for everyone.<br /><br />7.0 out of 10
