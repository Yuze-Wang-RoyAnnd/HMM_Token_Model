stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility. the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character. yardley is the modern equivalent of dickens' scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the christmas spirit overtakes him. the role is a 'walk in the park' for greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great falstaffs when he was part of the lunts' company. greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when, at age 61, he was featured in what was to become a film classic, the first and best film john huston ever directed: 'the maltese falcon'. 'cuddles' sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle european gemutlicheit. the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.
