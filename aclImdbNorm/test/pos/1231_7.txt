travis (james franco) is a young man riding a train for business reasons (we're to assume) who leaves his beloved phone behind. it gets picked up by a prostitute, terri (rachel miner), and when he goes to her city to pick it up, a series of events occur that are sure to stay with him forever.<br /><br />both characters have barriers they've put up to defend themselves from communication. but despite their facades, it's obvious both are eager to bust them down. in total there are about 30 or so spoken lines, but from the way james franco and rachel miner use their faces you might as well turn off the volume, words are unnecessary. a scene to look out for is terri staring at herself in the mirror. you can just feel her despair permeating the room.<br /><br />but, the movie isn't perfect. it's mostly filmed using hand-held cameras, which gets a bit distracting. mainly due to the acting of mr. franco and miner and the photography, the script's flaws don't stand out as much. still, sometimes it seems as if the story doesn't really know where it wants to go.<br /><br />all in all, this is the type of film that truly stays with you long after you watched it. an hour after you've seen it, you're still 'what-if'-ing yourself on the behalf of certain characters. it's not flawless, but still leaves you wanting more, wishing it were at least 4x as long.
