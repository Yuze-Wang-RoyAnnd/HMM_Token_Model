this bbc series is astonishingly good fun. i'd only seen a few minutes before i knew i had to own it and watch it again with all my friends. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone prudish, but almost anyone else is going to enjoy it--from the cinema snob to the entertainment-hungry masses. the lead character is a lesbian, but it's still worth watching if that's not your thing.<br /><br />rachael stirling is incredible in a lead role that stretches her into a dazzling assortment of emotions and situations, some of a bizarre nature. no one who saw this series would ever say she can't act. she makes us laugh, cry, get turned on and slap our foreheads in amazement.<br /><br />you can't really compare this story to anything else. it's not a rehash of style or plot. it's entirely it's own beast
