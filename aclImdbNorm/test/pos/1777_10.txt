it would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of hollywood people.it was in 1988 that chuck norris saw this film at cannes international film festival.he made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his hollywood films with him as a potent action star.he was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stone.there should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society.this is the reason why chuck norris' statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restless.an honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he/she states that kieslowski's film "dekalog: dekalog,piec (#1.5)" has universal connotations.this is because the events depicted in dekalog 5 can happen in any part of world.the best lesson which kielowski gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just society.this is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of repugnance in us.we would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring arnold schwarzenegger,chuck norris and jean claude van damme as they appear much too artificial.one can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiasts.kieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and misery.this is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide.
