imdb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines, but all i really want to say is -- "this is an incredible film, and you can't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it." you ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play. but i have to type something. so, let me point out the following: <br /><br />(1) river's edge contains what still may well rank as crispin glover's all-time funniest and best performance in a film, and if you have been following crispin glover at all, you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10. funny lines galore.<br /><br />(2) river's edge contains the second-most memorable performance of dennis hopper's career (other than the one in blue velvet), and it is really excellent. dennis hopper is really funny.<br /><br />(3) river's edge contains the best performance of keanu reeves' career, and it is excellent. it was the role he was born to play. he has plenty of good lines, but one in particular is really really funny. listen close when his character and the step-dad are talking to one another.<br /><br />still the best stoner film, it is much more than just that. it tends to show up in the drama sections of film-rental stores, but if this is a drama, it's the funniest drama of all time.
