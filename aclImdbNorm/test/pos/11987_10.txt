i liked this movie.<br /><br />no one i know likes it, but i do.<br /><br />i didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good. the script and plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than caddyshack 1.<br /><br />the only reason i didn't like caddyshack 2 is...<br /><br />no rodney dangerfield!<br /><br />i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie mason's part. although i did like jackie mason in the movie, it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfield.<br /><br />another flaw in the movie, that i didn't hate as much, was dan akroyd. the movie was done 8 years after the first one. bill murray, "carl", could've quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military, you know? if warner bros. had thought of that, it could've made the movie better, also.<br /><br />this was my comment for caddyshack ii.<br /><br />i give it 8.2 out of 10<br /><br />it could've been better, but good nonetheless.<br /><br />if you've seen caddyshack 1 and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack 2, i say give it a try.
