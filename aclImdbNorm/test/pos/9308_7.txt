it was a fascinating story waiting to be told. fat man and little boy takes us inside the trials and tribulations of a group of top american scientists handed a lofty task during the second world war: beat everyone else to the atomic bomb. sequestered in a heavily-guarded new mexico compound, the brainiacs slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense reality.<br /><br />fat man and little boy is one of those films that requires your close attention. it's a real thinking person's movie, not only from the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon, but also the moral implications of contributing to killing on a massive scale. characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as americans. the film is never preachy about, however, leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face. the performances deserve special mention as well. paul newman delivers one of his great, understated performances as the pattonesque general in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick for the allied forces.<br /><br />where fat man and little boy loses much of its traction is in the unnecessary romantic component. dwight schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. director roland joffe apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction. besides, it's the interaction among the scientists and their military hierarchy that give us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men.<br /><br />still, it's difficult not to recommend fat man and little boy. it's a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face put on one of the most intriguing stories in human history.
