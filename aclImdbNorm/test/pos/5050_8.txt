this is a charming movie to say the least. the main character, fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead by which he is surrounded. he and his accomplice go around pulling pranks and getting into trouble all over town. meanwhile his family is up in arms about what to do with him. from there you see fanda's relationships with his wife, best friend and son develop. it finally leads up to one of the best movie endings i have ever seen.<br /><br />the characters in this movie are rich and deep. they develop well through the course of the film. the movie has quite a range of moods. it goes from light and funny to grim and dark. any slow parts for you in this film will be made up for in the end.<br /><br />autumn spring carries a similar message like a lot of other european movies do -- don't lose sight of the small pleasures in life. if you enjoyed amelie, the eighth day or life is beautiful (all great films btw), you will probably like this movie.<br /><br />8.5/10
