wow! it's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. it's my favorite of the season. six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression, the drama can't get any better than that. paranoia reigns supreme as even mulder and scully have doubts about each other's sanity. i've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'the thing'. i haven't seen it, so i wouldn't know. ice is more than worth watching just to see mulder and scully truly testing their still developing trust of one another. this episode is intense and suspenseful to the end. you won't be disappointed!
