slick, tidy, and well-made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made. determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as "carlos the jackal", jack shaw (donald sutherland, "without limits", "space cowboys"), a cia operative and his israeli counterpart, amos (ben kingsley, "gandhi", "sexy beast") get a noble naval officer, annibal ramirez (aidan quinn, "music of the heart"), to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the kgb to kill the real carlos, because he took an offer from the cia. sutherland and kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to quinn here, who embodies himself here (in a dual role). director christian duguay and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with hitchcockian-like suspense and great sights of the world.
