spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan finnerty and his "dan band" perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour i've ever spent watching tv. this young man (dan) is such an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even dancer. he can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs, all of which have only been sung by women, to hip-hop, rock, also songs written for women.. this guy can do anything. i've seen him live at least 11 times, so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format, but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of dan's overwhelming star quality.do yourself a favor and watch this, or better yet, buy it.
