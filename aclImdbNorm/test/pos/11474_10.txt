it is fantastic! a sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deceit.<br /><br />the story is meticulously and ingeniously constructed. it is really a perfect mixture: it has all from suspense to humor and the story is told with lots of originality... the film is built up like a puzzle which is assembled piece by piece, and resolves the story... for the viewer there are plenty of surprises till the end!! i also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some hitchcock work. i've also seen films before where you see the same event happening from different points of view but this film goes beyond that. in this movie everything is built upon what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different location. every actor in the story has his own secret and we come to realize it in a way that contributes to assembling the puzzle.... i loved especially the dark humor scenes...which made laugh the whole theater.... this movie is a must see for everyone!
