so far miguel bardem's career it's been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema. he's made nothing but rubbish... until now. "incautos" has been quite a surprise: it's a serious film, with rhythm, with a great cast and very entertaining.<br /><br />the art of robbing, that's what "incautos" is about. a film much alike to david mamet's "house of game" and stuff like that. a thousand of twists in the script, and a story where nothing's like it seems.<br /><br />the weak points in latest bardem's movie may be the so-american language, that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural (especially victoria abril's. she's a hell of an actress, but in "incautos" she looks a little bit forced). ernesto alterio is not that bad, but he's not half as good actor as his father... and what to say about luppi?? well, he's the man.<br /><br />in short: a good movie. the best that miguel bardem has ever made. i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his career.<br /><br />*my rate: 7/10
