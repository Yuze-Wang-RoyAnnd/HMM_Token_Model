the lone ranger & tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the lone ranger discovers from a conversation with the indian chief tomache that each man possessed a medallion. the five medallions given by tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. can the lone ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it? is there really a lost city of gold somewhere upon native land? <br /><br />watching this, i kept knowing what was going to happen beforehand and everything seemed really familiar until eventually i realized i had seen this exact same movie when i was but a little kid..suddenly the memories flooded back and i remembered having quite a fun time as a child enjoying this one with a bunch of my friends. as an adult though, the plot is somewhat predictable but you know this, while not quite in the same league as the 1956 film, remains a lot of fun to watch. clayton moore is perfect as the lone ranger and jay silverwheels as tonto steals a lot of this movie as he's probably in more action scenes than even the lone ranger. there's some very familiar faces on hand here including douglas kennedy as ross brady, headman of the hooded raiders gang, charles watts as a bigoted sheriff, and ralph moody as a kindly padre.
