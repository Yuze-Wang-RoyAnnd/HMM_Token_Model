having dabbled in the modeling industry (as a model), i watch this show with a slightly different view than most might. while i admit antm can be a fun, and entertaining show, as the seasons go on it seems to continue to drift from any reality.<br /><br />the show seems to be almost pure publicity for its contestants, seeing that none of the show's winners (or fellow contestants) have made much of a name for themselves out from under of the show's umbrella. maybe that's because the truth is any girl with real potential to be a high-fashion model shouldn't have too much difficulty submitting to agencies (you can do so via email or snail mail if distance prevents you from attending an agency open call), signing to an agency, and starting a modeling career. yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently neither does antm. and participating in a reality show seems to offer less of a boost in the modeling business, than signing to a top or decent agency (which only one contestant each cycle has a guarantee of anyway).<br /><br />nonetheless, the show can't hurt, certainly can be amusing, and has a sort of magic that particularly works for teenage girls, i have found. though, i must add, antm may become a tad tiring and dull, after watching several cycles, as it has become for me. and besides some unrealistic situations (each more outrageous than the last) the only other annoyance, is the overuse of "tyra, tyra, tyra!" tyra seems to genuinely want to guide these girls to success, but is it necessary for each of models' temporary digs to be covered in tyra pictures; for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or scenario that "tyra" experienced and overcame? i think not.<br /><br />in my opinion, take out a little tyra, put back in a little more reality, and antm could be a 10 star show, instead of a 7.
