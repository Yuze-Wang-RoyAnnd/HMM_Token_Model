i've watched a lot of television in my 51 years, but i've never had so much fun week after week, as i had watching oz. the acting by the entire cast was excellent. the writing was just perfect, with every character remaining consistent throughout the six year run. i also enjoyed the mayhem and the ultra-violence. it may sound odd, but it was at times, comical finding out how one of the characters would eventually end up dead. i particularly enjoyed the true romance and love between beecher and keller. those two men really knew how to throw down, in every way possible. i truly hope that hbo will continue to show us re-runs of this great show forever! i've watched every episode at least 4 times yet i still look forward to tuesday and thursday nights at 11 p.m. for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show.
