_saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by western audiences. that being said, i enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains. some of the scenery is truly breathtaking, and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive _saltmen_ with minimal use of the fast-forward.<br /><br />
