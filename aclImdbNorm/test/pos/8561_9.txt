i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly. i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager, and again in college. i thought it was funny. and there are boobs everywhere! it seems like in the late 70s and 80s there were loads of this type of film made, from r-rated films like "porkys" to soft-core "au pair girls"; it's a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity. the thing that made hots great was that, like the previous two films, it's a hell of a lot of fun. hots is like a girl-power version of "animal house", with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam. on a side note, whoever designed the "hooters" girls outfits must certainly have seen this film.
