this movie was marketed extremely well. when it was released in '97, during the middle of master p's fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves. that's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250,000 copies and still goin'.<br /><br />if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out. it has a few old school phatty videos and don't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus ice cream party. so what i got to say to all the people who don't like master p or no limit records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to deter tru no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes.
