ah, hitchcock! it's hard to find a bad hitchcock movie until he lost it after the birds (1963) and saboteur proves the point. having admired most of this director's work for many years, i had managed to skip this one, perhaps from lack of interest in priscilla lane and robert cummings as lead actors. i was of course familiar with the statue of liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but i wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest. was i wrong! the suspenseful plot gets cooking right off the bat through a chance encounter between the bad guy saboteur and the good guy wrongly accused protagonist and continues zooming along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes. familiar hitchcockian elements are all there: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; people not being what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely locations that intensify the suspenseful scene being played out within them (an airplane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion, an upper floor of a skyscraper, and finally the torch of the statue of liberty).<br /><br />throughout is humor provided by supporting players, generous dollops of early ww2- vintage social comment, moments of human warmth where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human, getting nothing in return
