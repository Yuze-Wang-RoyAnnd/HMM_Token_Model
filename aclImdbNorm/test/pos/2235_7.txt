is this a good movie? no, certainly not. but for jolie lovers it's must-have. her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come. the current rating however (3.2) is too low. the movie might lack a good storyline, and isn't a great sf-movie altogether but the acting is good enough (and like mentioned before, jolie's acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very direct, with a lot of close-ups. the scenery is bizarre. and last but not least, leaving van damme out was a very good choice. presumably, non of the jolie lovers would like to see her having sex with him. this movie has all the potential of becoming a cult movie.
