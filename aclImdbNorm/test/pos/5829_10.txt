one of the best tv shows out there, if not the best one. why? simple: it has guts to show us real life in prison, without any clich'es and predictable twists. this is not prison break or any other show, actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for children's. profanity, cursing, shots of explicit violence and using drugs, disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes... all this and more in oz. but this is not the best part of oz; the characters are the strongest point of this show; they're all excellent and not annoying, despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals. the actors are excellent, my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan o'reilly and tobias beecher, because they're so unique and changing their behavior completely. and most of all... the don't have no remorse for their actions. overall... oz is amazing show, the best one out there. forget about csi and shows about stupid doctors... this is the deal... oz!
