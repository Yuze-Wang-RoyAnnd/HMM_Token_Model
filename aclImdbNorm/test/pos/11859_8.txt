i rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. what a shame! this movie is intelligent, witty, hilarious, fast-paced, and realistically ridiculous. the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clich'ed, tired stereotypes. it was refreshing to watch. i couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not-so-mainstream movie into the starved-for-intelligent-comedy mainstream. the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness, heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days--i felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich. how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row--it is so weak in too many ways to mention. i guess i'm just happy that movies like "seeing.." are still being made somewhere out there.
