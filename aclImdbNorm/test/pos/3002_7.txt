husband-and-wife doctor team carole and niles nelson are doing modestly well in their careers, but niles has a gambling problem. his luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from joe gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself. loving his change of fortune (and snazzy new apartment), niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang. unfortunately, his shady deals come to light in a police raid, which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well.<br /><br />at this point the plot comes into focus, as carole nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended. this involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single- handedly. <br /><br />this is not a hard-edged gangster picture, but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like matlock or murder she wrote. there is some tension, but the mood is kept light by bogart's tongue-in-cheek performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the "napoleon of crime." his other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums. and there's some snappy dialog between bogart and francis, especially when she's treating his injuries at his hideout. of course, as in all gangster flicks, there's a big shootout ending, but with a humorous twist. this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom.
