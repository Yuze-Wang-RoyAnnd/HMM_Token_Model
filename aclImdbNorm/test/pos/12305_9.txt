"the dead" truly is a work of art. clearly, john huston meant to show that he was still "in the full glory of some passion" by making it, even as his body was failing him. this movie is powerfully affecting and lingers in the mind long after it is done. reading the joyce short story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this film. as a statement by an artist of his love of life and his craft, "the dead" stands alone.
