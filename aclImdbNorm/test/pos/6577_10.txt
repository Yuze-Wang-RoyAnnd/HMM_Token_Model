a touching documentary that puts a human face on the tragedy of 9/11 by showing how one small community coalesced to honor two high school friends lost on that day. the film interweaves the lives of chris and tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos. through their reminiscences we glimpse two lives tragically cut short. the film also documents how, through a series of coincidences, an inspirational memorial garden was brought forth through the efforts of many people, both known and unknown to the two victims. through the laughter and the tears(and the sweat) we see the power of hope and honor and love. this films evokes many different emotions, but the final feeling is one of admiration of the human spirit undaunted by tragedy.
