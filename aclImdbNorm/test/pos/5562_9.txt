having just borrowing the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother, i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and handing it back. i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliff-hanger - a mere week later and i've watched the entire season. where i found the time for this i have no idea.<br /><br />this show is great. it doesn't take itself too seriously, it has likeable characters who are well acted, and the special effects (ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there) are "special" enough to give it that polished feel. at first, i didn't realise it was filmed mostly here, and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a sci-fi show - it was most amusing for the main character (john) to land back in sydney midway through the first season.<br /><br />i believe this show's biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had. they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions, and the continue to smatter john's conversations with slang in an amusing and unforced way. on top of that, having watched the entire voyager and next gen series, i see little plot rip-off - so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season. i hope the rest of it is as good.<br /><br />farscape is not like any other sci-fi that i've enjoyed in the past. i heard that the fourth season wasn't as good as the first three, and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the 5th. i hope that they revive this show - with the same actors in either a movie or another series. it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show that's had so much thought put into it, to have it axed without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbed.<br /><br />gotta go now... heading back to my brother's place to snaffle the 2nd season.<br /><br />v.
