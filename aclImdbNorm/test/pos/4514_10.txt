i just saw it at an advance screening i haven't read the book, but heard many good things about it.<br /><br />the movie was absolutely fantastic, very moving. with a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters. shaun toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand persian/dari was incredible.<br /><br />one thing to notes it that khaled hosseini actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies. even after seeing the movie several times "he was sobbing".<br /><br />also the animation from the intro was exquisite, with names displayed as if it were persian calligraphy, very unique! at times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently, but all in all this was a great movie.
