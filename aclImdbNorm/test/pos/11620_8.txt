"subconscious cruelty" has to be one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen.still it's extremely grim and gory at times,so fans of politically correct mainstream horror garbage shouldn't bother.the film mixes many wonderful visuals with plenty of sleaze and gore.it is extremely odd,vicious and disturbing,so fans of bizarre cinema won't be disappointed. my favourite segment from "subconscious cruelty" is "human larvae" which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister.the birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten.the last segment "right brain/martyrdom" has to be seen to be believed.it's incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and grisly torture.we see jesus christ captured by three naked females who mutilate him,ripping flesh from his chest,licking a wound on his knee and pissing on him.there is also a jesus statue with a projection of a swastika on it."subconscious cruelty" is a truly memorable film that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema.check it out.
