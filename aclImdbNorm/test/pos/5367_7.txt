the first time i saw brotherhood of satan i was 12 yrs old i saw it in a little town in central washington state it played before tales from the crypt which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the brotherhood of satan. all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie. the beginning was good we had just sat down and that tank did a number on that station wagon.<br /><br />what struck me about the movie was the scenery around the town in which it was filmed it looked almost like the area around chelan wa where i saw the movie especially when they were driving towards the town of hillsboro which is the location of the movie a small town in sw new mexico. i have always liked lq jones and strother martin and also charles bateman who was on get smart another show i like. i gave the movie a 7 and later on when i did get to see tales from the crypt i thought brotherhood of satan was better.
