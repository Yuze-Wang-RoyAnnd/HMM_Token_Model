for anyone who has ever sought happiness, "half empty" is a must-see. this original cross- cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make "the producers" seem boringly staid. writer bob patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend spills her heart out, ending their relationship. when his book on happiness, "north star" finds zero success in the states, his publishers send him to germany for a book signing tour. while explaining their decision to bob, the boardroom erupts into a rousing song which would make monty python proud. from his arrival in hamburg, bob's complete ignorance of the german language leaves him at a distinct disadvantage. however, he soldiers on, impervious of his hosts true feelings towards him, until a wildly devoted fan arrives and changes everyone's reaction toward him.<br /><br />the original songs propel the film, often describing the subtext of the story in side-splitting precision. the cast, led by robert peters, exhibit an immaculately dry sense of humor and inhabit their characters as if they were not acting. see it for: a case study of how good intentions are totally irrelevant; how merciless americans abroad are viewed; how little reason it takes to burst into song, and, above all, for a silly, entertaining, unconventional laugh.
