very good 1939 film where john garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. trouble is that the killer and garfield's girl, ann sheridan, in a brief but good performance, get killed while trying to elude the police.<br /><br />a crooked attorney persuades garfield to flee n.y. he lands in arizona and meets up with the dead end kids.. they've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble.<br /><br />of course, garfield finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash.<br /><br />may robson is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth. claude rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that garfield is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in arizona.<br /><br />the film really deals with garfield's relation to the boys. while the ending is good, you want to see garfield go back to n.y. to proclaim his innocence.
