the detective story is not typical for the matrix universe. it is a film-noir-esque private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. rich, in terms of its visual appeal. the snowing scenes, the grainyiness, it all stuns the eye.<br /><br />but what about the story? it is interesting, even if it feels a little out of place. the agents hire a privat detective to track down trinity. he finds out that they tried the approach before, but with hazardous consequences for the hired detectives. still, he tries to locate her and eventually succeeds, through alice in wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms. then things begin to get interesting...<br /><br />all in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie.<br /><br />8/10
