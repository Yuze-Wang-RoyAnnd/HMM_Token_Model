i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous rater.<br /><br />i first stumbled across this movie back in the '80s, when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital. unfortunately, many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home. i especially enjoyed the ending, where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the hospitalized grodin. trust me, its fairly accurate.<br /><br />of course, doors at most psych hospitals are not locked, nor are straightjackets used much these days, and any hospital must be licensed to have a "padded room".<br /><br />but a wonderfully underrated film, and certainly one that is quite amusing.<br /><br />jeff
