i just had the opportunity to see 'nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the u.s. as 'the golden door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from sicially to the u.s. in the early days of the 20th century. it also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land. the (mostly) italian cast, with a few exceptions works well. this is a quiet,understated film that is lovely to look at (the occasional,but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure),while the screenplay is well written. this is a film for those who are sick & tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn (not that i have any burning issues with popcorn,mind you!---i actually love the stuff). you would do wise to seek out nuovomondo/the golden door (or whatever it's being titled in your area).
