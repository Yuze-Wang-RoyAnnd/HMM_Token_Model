don't know what film or version jeff saw, but this entire film was awesome, not just poitier and going. the story was riveting, suspenseful and engaging. and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy, get real. yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory. as a rule, they did not "patrol" but exercised warrants on criminals only. i did find it odd that corby didn't seem to have "any' indian friends. i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange. even as corby returned to his people, his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.
