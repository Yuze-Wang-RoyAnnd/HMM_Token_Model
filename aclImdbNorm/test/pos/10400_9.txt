like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick, we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned. we had good reason to do so, the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu, dark waters, juon - the grudge, and a tale of two sisters. by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for mockery and derision, despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead. now, don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made, the likes of marebito and shutter, to mention but two, will stand as minor genre classics some day. but the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success-drunk tramp home to bed! then along comes a film like noroi - the curse. a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots, yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it. what i'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all. the film is a documentary about one of japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on. he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, yet there is no baby there, apart from a middle aged woman and her son. these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up. a psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...<br /><br />to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit. the film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports, and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line. the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really.<br /><br />what is refreshing about noroi is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences. if you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere. the film's strength lies in it's slow, gradual build up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it. the climax is pretty damned freaky, but just when you think the film is over, you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll, and sweet holy f*ck, is it a killer. in terms of acting, it is mostly convincing. you get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, tin foil covered clairvoyant, but that soon dries up half way through the film. the film also has a slightly 'nastier' feel than a lot of asian ghost horror, as there is a violent streak to some of the events too.<br /><br />overall, noroi is one to watch on your own, late at night. not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film. it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late, then it is under your skin. just let yourself go to this one completely. and not a lank haired ghost lady in sight?? no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan, let alone had an american remake lined up yet. check this one out if you can, essential viewing in my books!
