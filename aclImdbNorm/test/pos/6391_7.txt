on a routine mission in iraq a group of delta soldiers recover a computer hard drive from an alqueda training camp detailing the location of weapons specialist dr walsh. after witnessing the termination of his top secret weapons development program dr walsh finds an alternative funding source and sets up a new research facility deep in the notorious belzan forest in chechnya where he is developing weapons and selling them to chechnyan rebels.the team of deltas is sent on a black ops mission to retrieve the doctor and his technology before the russians find him and his lab.what the delta team soon discover is that the doctors latest weapons is a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically altered to develop a taste for human flesh. i found this movie to be much better than what i was expecting.there is lots of action and lots of blood. its more or less what you would expect from a creature feature. the acting isn't great but its passable. i have certainly seen worse.overall its an enjoyable movie for what it is. a good popcorn movie.
