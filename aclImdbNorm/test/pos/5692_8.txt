"black water" is one of the most tense films i have viewed in a long time. the story moves fast as it follows three tourists (all great actors) into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat. soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp, they are flipped over by something huge in the water.<br /><br />hastily, the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. throughout the next two days, they have to desperately try to escape from the crocodile's evil watchful eye, and he doesn't seem to want to go away. the movie drags just a tad bit, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? it's so much better than "primeval" and other recent crocodile/ underwater predator thrillers. the tension is heavy, and all three leads give terrific performances. truly chilling, this movie struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. apparently based on true events.
