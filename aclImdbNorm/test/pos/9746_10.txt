flash gordon was a first rate serial. i know there were a few goofs, however, i didn't watch it for the flaws. buster crabbe is flash gordon. he was not a trained actor but he gave a very good, convincing performance. jean rogers is pretty and at 20 yrs. old did, in my opinion, a pretty good job. charles middleton as emperor ming, is superb. he was in a lot of other movies, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. his portrayal of "ming the merciless", in all 3 flash gordon serials, was top notch. the rest of the cast also did a very good job. well, boys and girls, get some popcorn, settle back and enjoy. john r. tracy.
