i am awed by actress bobbie phillips and her superb skill as an action star! this movie is propelled by her wonderful acting and terrific action prowess. i am a fan of sci-fi but i must say that this film exceeds most science fiction films in it's cinematography and mostly it's utilization of an actress whose presence supersedes the plot which is fine but is nothing new. even though it looks as though this film was made for television, in my opinion it is better than most theatrically released films of its kind.
