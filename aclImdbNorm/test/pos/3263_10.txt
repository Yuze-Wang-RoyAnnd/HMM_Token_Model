if you enjoyed films like pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, and lock, stock, and two smoking barrels, you are going to love two hands. it has the same type of black humor beat to it and will keep you entertained through the whole film. like pulp fiction, it has the wacky scenarios that the characters get into and how they deal with them. along with gallipoli and picnic at hanging rock, this has to be one of the best australian films i've seen. it also stars a young heath ledger before he got real big in the states.<br /><br />this is a terribly underrated movie that i believe is just as good as pulp fiction and those greats. you have to see it!
