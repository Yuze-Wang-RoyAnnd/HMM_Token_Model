dan finnerty and the dan band are so-o-o-o-o-o good, they must be seen to believe. does anyone out there have a copy of the bravo concert for sale?? please, if there is an upcoming release, let us all know. i checked the bravo site, but there is no future date scheduled for a repeat performance by the most appealing guys ever choreographed, the dan band. what great energy they exude, flinging themselves about with cute american-boy attitude, based on butch sensitivity being wrapped up in sequins and tears, making men and women alike fall in love with them. i hope enough people can influence the powers that be at bravo to bring the show back into our lives, as a semi-annual special.
