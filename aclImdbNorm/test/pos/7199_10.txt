this film is the smartest comedy i have ever seen, a lot of jokes are either a parody of another film, (from star wars to dragon ball to power rangers to kung fu etc..) or somehow related to history of whatever, (otis creates the elevator), a lot of jokes are also related to the modern world and made fun of because it was b.c. (like the wheels of the horse wagon spinning) other jokes are just plain total non-sense but also hilarious (like the famous scene, with the dog running after the roman guy with the little music) in fact in this movies they mix pretty much every kind of humor. i watched this film 6 times already and every single time i watch it i find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where waldo is part of the egyptian crowd). it is the funniest movie i have every seem, finally a laugh-out-loud comedy, that doesn't include toilet or sex humor. numerobis is also what makes the movie, everything that comes out of that guys mouth is hilarious. this movie is nearly perfect except a few clich'ed thing, like the fact that asterix gets his power back because he is kissed, that is plain stupid. but overall an excellent movie!! 9.5 out 10
