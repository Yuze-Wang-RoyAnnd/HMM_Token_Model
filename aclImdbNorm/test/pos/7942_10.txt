alexander nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda. the people of russia are threatened by two major enemies, the mongols and the teutonic knights of the holy roman empire. in ordered to unite the warring, rival princes in the russian realm, nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evils (the teutonics). this influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day. the soundtrack by composer prokiev and eisentstein's direction are a sight and sound to behold many years later, john milius used many of the movies scenes, set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into conan.<br /><br />one of my favorite lines from conan was taken from this movie. "it's not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that wields it is what matters." the comparisons are unmistakable. the armor that james earl jones and the leader of the teutonic knights wear are virtually identical. a true tribute paid from one director to another.<br /><br />i give alexander nevsky one of my highest recommendations. the movie plays like the final act of richard iii. the presence of prince alexander on the screen is truly amazing.
