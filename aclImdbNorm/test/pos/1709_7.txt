i've been a fan of larry king's show for awhile, i think he does a terrific job overall and i don't think he ever 'wusses' out, as so many people seem to believe. he's a subtle scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with paris hilton, during her first post-jail tv interview.<br /><br />the thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that hilton is still apparently clueless about why judge sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more, actually made her serve it) . in all the time she was in jail, supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell, she never once, in her mind, rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that judge sauer saw fit to impose on her. she never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she (1) showed up late in court for the original hearing and (2) proceeded to inform him, when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended, did she not get the papers in the mail, that "i have people who read that sort of thing for me." <br /><br />all the time she was in her cell, she never came to the realization that this action (showing up late) and that statement -- and more importantly, the attitude - the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed -- just might have made judge sauer (pardon the pun) go sour on her. <br /><br />last night, on king's show, after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience, how she has "learned" her lesson, she answered his question, "do you think you got a raw deal?" with a resounding yes. and during the course of the conversation (if you can call it that), she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her. king asked, gently, more than once, if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she "finds" herself in, to which she pretty much stared at him blankly. she basically, therefore, holds the conscious belief that she's been victimized in this situation; she does not understand how she herself caused it, that day in court, by her cavalier attitude with the judge. i feel this is very sad - tragic, even, considering what a huge "role model" hilton is to some people, and it renders anything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness, contradiction and hypocrisy. <br /><br />during the course of the interview, hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the bible. at the end of the interview, king scored major points by asking her what her favorite bible passage was. she responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes (completely superficial non-insights, which she had read on air as if she were nelson mandella or something) and finally grunting out, "i don't have a favorite passage." <br /><br />judge sauer, in my book, is a hero, and after last night, so is larry king, for subtly exposing hilton for what she truly is.
