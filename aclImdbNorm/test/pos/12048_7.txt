i have seen many of shahrukh's movies and this is a very good role for him. he has such versatility, but he mainly stays in positive roles. as rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, yet i found myself sympathizing with him much of the movie. if for nothing else, watch this movie for shahrukh. he plays a very complex and real character very convincingly. the story is very typical and has been done before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining. the opening is a little confusing, but by the end, it doesn't matter. the songs i found very likable and give insight to what characters are thinking. very clever. i think this movie was very good and recommend it to all shahrukh khan fans. it is a must see!
