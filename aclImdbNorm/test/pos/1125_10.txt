i am so excited that greek is back! this season looks really eventful. im glad that casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority. its really funny that she wants to go into politics & that they're highlighting her 'scheming talent.' i loved calvin's new haircut! it makes him look more mature. they should shave cappy's head, as well. all the guys are hot but calvin is definitely the hottest! i cant wait to see more of him! i'm especially interested in what happens between calvin, adam, & rusty! i also love rebecca. she's really pretty. i actually think that rebecca & calvin should hook up. go for it, calvin! join my team!
