i have seen this movie twice now on cable. the first time i saw it, it caught me by suprise. the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70's. these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating. i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be. i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life's problems, however; this film did a great job of taking me back. back to the vacant pools, the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to cherry hill nj. i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it, you had to live it. otherwise, it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me. but for those of you (and you know who you are), who did live it, you know exactly what i am talking about! in any event, i don't care who you are, if you get a chance to see this movie...do it! i give thanks to the z-boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie! job well done!
