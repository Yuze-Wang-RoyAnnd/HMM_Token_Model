------ spoilers----- spoilers----- spoilers--------just a few small ones <br /><br />saw this on satilite channel, missed the first 30 min of movie, will keep this comment short and informative.<br /><br />the movie is basically about 5 characters,the acting is very bad for afew characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2. this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical, mysterious and ... you get the point; but do to their own, personal, lack in thinking they fall terribly short. like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd - looks the part but his tongue can't speak it. the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly - unknowingly i believe - that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any - exactly as it was said. the ending was bad as well. but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady, although she, as well as the rest, had a lot of clich'e s.<br /><br />so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above? simple, i give the entire seven stars to lisa keller - one sexy a$$ momma. she is fine lol. i am an appreciator of beauty, and she is exactly that. but don't get me confused because i'm not a pervert and this movie is not a porno in any way. their is somethin about her i cant explain, but i like it. i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out, bumps into keller. she tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance. he throws her down, kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down, no panties ;). now, although she has an amazing ass - and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think - it was her facial expression that got me. she wanted it, and that look had me thinking i was behind that. i would have torn that booty up! after that expression, i jus couldn't look at her objectively anymore, i was in love. lol. i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa keller wasn't playing the lead role, i would have changed the channel.. well... after i had seen the scene i mentioned above. i am a lisa keller fan know, but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor, seeing this 2003 movie is her latest. but i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it.
