as someone who was in a pan-hellenic sorority, i wasn't sure what to expect when i tuned into this show. after seeing so many over dramatizations in "made for tv movies" and the craziness of the reality shows, i was curious to see if greek would be able to show the true college and greek life experience.<br /><br />i was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever-familiar characters of this genre, but it was also able to add depth to the characters. greek life isn't just about parties and petty conflict. although those things happen within greek life, they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a person's life. to characterize it as some exclusive experience to those in a greek organization would be false. most of the story lines and situations taking place in greek can and do take place everywhere, in every circle of friends, on sports teams, in real life. but i've watched both episodes and my "little sister" whom i'm still very close to and i have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how they've truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiences.<br /><br />i liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. cappie telling rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help, that was very true to life. you can't stay in an organization if you have bad grades. the way rusty got his assignment to his professor was far fetched, but it was entertaining. even the dynamic between casey and rusty; it happens, you grow up and whatever your relationship with your sibling(s) was, it changes so you must adjust.<br /><br />the bottom line: greek is a great show, great entertainment value, and enough "real life" in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time.
