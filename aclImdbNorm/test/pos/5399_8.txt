imaginary heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24 year-old dan harris, is tag-lined "people are never who they seem to be". perhaps this is wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing; yet, i rented this movie in spite of the tag-line, rather than because of it. and, i'm glad i did. i found the move an insightful examination of tragedy. i personally found it to be a movie about coping with dreams: particularly those which are lost. in the case of one son, "loss" requires deep examination of what he had, and didn't have, in his life. yet, the central tragedy of the movie, while posing enticing questions in its own right, acts primarily as the backdrop against which different coping styles are set into relief. i believe the film inquires into an important question: how do we cope with our dreams, particularly where heroes become imaginary?
