i actually first watched one dark night in the theater & wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper. i loved it then & i still love it. the storyline revolves around two people. first of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death. she then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death. the mauseleum he's buried in plays host to the other main person, a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her & dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group. they go back in the night to scare her & find scares for themselves. the cast is led by meg tilly with supporting roles by adam west and one of my personal favorites elizabeth daily aka e.g. daily. check this one out if you love 80's movies & cheesy horror movies, you won't be disatisfied.
