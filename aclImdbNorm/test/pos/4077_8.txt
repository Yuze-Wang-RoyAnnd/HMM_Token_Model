i was watching an nfl game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the hbo type channels. i missed the beginning but when i started watching deadly voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. you will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your la-z-boy throughout this one. if you get the chance take the time to watch it. every once in a while i think about having the cable company take off my movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them. happy holidays to all from cape cod !!!
