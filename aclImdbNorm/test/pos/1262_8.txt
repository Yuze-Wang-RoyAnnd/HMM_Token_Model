this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. there was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white. the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. even the dialogue was good along with the acting. it reminded me of what was to come in memento by not being in chronological order. i liked how the main character tried to use what cobb taught him for example saying "everyone has a box" which he put his personal things into. also, on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight, two other great movies. there is a great twist in the end which i'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though i kind of figured what would happen when cobb gave the young man d lloyds credit card. i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by plato one of my favorite philosophical books. this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it, plus it only being an hour long. there is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant.
