i can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. to be honest, i saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. yes, i rented it after reading others' comments. they are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. they are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of dr. graves.<br /><br />also interesting is scott clark, who plays grant, the kid in the wheelchair. i identify with the character he played, perhaps because i am in a wheelchair.<br /><br />this movie is certainly worth your looking at.
