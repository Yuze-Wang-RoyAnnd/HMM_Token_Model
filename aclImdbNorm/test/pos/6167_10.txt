if you want to see the true, vile nature of communism, watch the movie dark blue world. (tvamomodr'y svet) it recounts how the brave czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to england to join the fight against the nazis. after the war, the communists feared they had picked up dangerous western ideas about freedom. so, they had these heroic czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same nazis they risked their lives to defeat.<br /><br />if hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama portions of "pearl harbor" with this movie. in dark blue world, you really make a connection to all the characters. in pearl harbor, everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person.<br /><br />there are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. one funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character karel is being taught english by a rather formal englishwoman. when he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. in typical stoic english fashion, the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts karel, and shames him into behaving.<br /><br />the aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing, and they help to keep the movie lively. i read that it cost $11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny.<br /><br />ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys.... beware! this movie would make general patton weep. and if you are a dog lover, you'll use up half a box of kleenex. don't say i didn't warn you.
