here's another entertaining clint eastwood action-suspense film. i am not a particularly fan of his but i have to hand to him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. this is one more example. it didn't hurt, either, to have john malkovich as his co-star. now there is an intense actor! in this story, malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given. he also has a interesting voice.<br /><br />rene russo is fairly low-key (for her), but that's fine and eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end. i guess he couldn't stop playing the "dirty harry"-type figures, but he played them well.<br /><br />there were some negatives this film, however, namely: credibility in parts as there were a couple of times, had this been real-life, the killer would have done away with eastwood. the climatic scene, in particularly, had too many holes in it. there also were too many abuses of lord's name in vain in here.<br /><br />overall, however, this is good, escapist fare.
