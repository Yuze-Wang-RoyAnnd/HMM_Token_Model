hitch is a light-hearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances. will smith turns in a believable performance as a cloak and dagger date doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. smith was excellent, never schmaltzing it up too much.<br /><br />the best piece of acting goes to the actor (don't know name) playing this accountant who has fallen for this woman who is out of his league. this actor did an excellent job of character development as he listens to smith's directions, but in the end, just can't help being who he really is.<br /><br />and in the end, that's the main message of this film. be who you are in love, and you'll be ok.<br /><br />at the same time, will smith meets this attractive lady and the date doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman. don't know her name, but she was pretty good too.<br /><br />overall, this was a delightful, light movie that is definitely worth seeing.
