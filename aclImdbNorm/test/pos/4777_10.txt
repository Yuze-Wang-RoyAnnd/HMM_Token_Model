this 8 minute gem is not only timeless, but it is a cartoon milestone. it is mickey's third cartoon, and one of his best ones too. it is a cartoon milestone because it was the first one with sound. and my goodness, even after 70+ years it is ever so good, and gives real additional weight to the narrative. the black and white animation is excellent, and the character features are convincing enough. the music is wonderful, i love the soundtrack, it does add to the fun the cartoon has, no matter how thin the story sometimes is. and the cartoon is funny! so many memorable moments, like the cow's teeth being used as an xylophone and its udder as a bagpipe. the characters are also engaging, mickey and minnie two landmark disney characters are well voiced by walt disney, and pete serves well as "the villain of the piece". all in all, "steamboat willie" is just a timeless gem that everybody should see at least once. 10/10 bethany cox
