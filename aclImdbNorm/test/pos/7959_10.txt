christmas in august is a perfect movie. a flawless movie about all the flaws of humanity. on the outside it may look like a movie about death, but is in fact a movie about life. i simply cannot recommend this movie enough. and be not afraid, dear readers, it is not a depressing film. as stated, it's a movie about the brightness of life coached under the guise of death. you will laugh. you will cry. you will realize that life is fragile and short. and you will leave the viewing with a better understanding of how precious life is.<br /><br />10 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)
