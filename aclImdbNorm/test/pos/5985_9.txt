this movie is a gem! it is the story of juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and romuald, the president of same. he takes no notice of her, he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time. he is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette. as the cleaning woman, no one pays any attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss.<br /><br />i have been keeping an eye out for years for the dvd of this and to see a previous comment about it being released in sep 2007 raised my hopes. alas, i cannot find a dvd, does anyone know if there is/was one?
