out of the top 24 lesbian films in my library, i must rate this one as the number one film of all times. this film will go down in history as the best in it's genre. it is a story about a girl (rachael stirling) who goes from riches to rags and from rags to riches, with her first love (keeley hawes) popping in and out of her life. it is set against a victorian background in the 1890's, which makes it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry. this film spared no expense for music and costumes, and the make-up rachael and keeley wore while on stage in the halls only added to the film's diversity.<br /><br />no matter what kind of films you favor, i can guarantee this film will not only amaze you, but will keep your attention through all three episodes. this film will be played and enjoyed for decades to come. the unrated dvd collector's version is a must for anyone's library. rachael stirling and keeley hawes was the best choice for the casting in these two roles, and they played them extremely well.
