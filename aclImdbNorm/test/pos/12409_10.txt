this picture doesn't have any big explosions or expensive chase sequences. however, it does have really wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts this at the top of my "indie-must-see list." taylor nichols and james remar are terrific together. the young cast surprised me with really consistent acting. usually, indie pictures have some weak link, but there are no weak links here. impressive. go get this one.
