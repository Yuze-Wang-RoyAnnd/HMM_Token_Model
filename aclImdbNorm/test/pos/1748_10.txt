normally i am a typical "creepy-crawly-hatin'" girl, but after watching this film (on youtube of course), i'm having different perspectives. and also i did not know that my favorite animation studio - fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans (lighted cigars and cigarette butts,footsteps,etc.), and how a plucky young grasshopper named hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of honey the bee; i love the lovely ms. honey. you know, after watching the film, the bugs reminded me of the some of the "jitter-bugs" from don bulth's thumbelina. and out of the songs in the film, i love "we're a couple in the castle;" when i sing that song, it almost made me cry.<br /><br />this wonderful film was the second (and final) feature to come out of the fleischer studio. the film was originally going to be released on november of 1941, but since the fleischer's rival, disney, released dumbo weeks earlier, paramount changed the date to december of the same year, but mr. bug unfortunately went into a, then unrealized, trap of terrible timing. having the misfortune of opening two days after the attack on pearl harbor, mr. bug was a financial disaster and led to the ousting of max and dave fleischer, from the studio they had established in 1919, and reorganized the company as famous studios. another huge factor in their departure was the fact that max and dave fleischer were no longer speaking to one another due to disputes (how sad it was). overall i love both films from the fleischer bros. - gulliver and mr. bug.
