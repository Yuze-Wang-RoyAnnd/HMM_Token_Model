i agree with the aussie's comments for the most part. however, there id seem to be a fairly decent plot, if unoriginal. christina (kelli mccarty) inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge. she gets reacquainted with chip (bobby johnston) whom she had known when she was growing up in there. the plot thickens when james (paul logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, shene (devinn lane) because christina had been james' stripper friend in years gone by, and the implication is that james had done her wrong somehow. to add interest to the movie sophia linn (monique parent) a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge, as do eric (sebastien guy) and linda (flower), pair of lawyers from the city. james sicks the local building codes inspector on christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. so the question is, "how far will james go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?"<br /><br />watch for devinn lane here and in "beauty betrayed." she seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "r" world. another notable is samantha mcconnell, playing the role of "bait," clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies!
