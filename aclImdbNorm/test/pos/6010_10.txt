this film is wonderful example of the quality dramas that channel 4 and the bbc have produced over the years. ted danson delivers a powerful performance of a man tormented by memories noone will accept, and a society that believes he is insane. it is a remarkable performance by a man most known for his role in cheers, a tv comedy sitcom. the supporting cast are all very well chosen, not least mary steenbergen, danson's wife, who acts the part of gulliver's wife in the film. but above all it is the seamless and very delicate shifts between our world and gulliver's world that make this film. the difference in perspective between giants and midgets, all acted by real actors is beautifully captured. a rare treat of cinematography and direction.
