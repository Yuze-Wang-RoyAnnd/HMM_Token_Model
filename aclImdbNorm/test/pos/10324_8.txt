clyde bruckman borrows the premise of this short from buster keaton's "seven chances," recently tepidly remade as "the bachelor." in the original, buster has 24-hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money. in this version, musical teacher prof. shemp has only 7 hours (after all, it is a short!). this is one of the better stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines (including the telephone booth scene with moe & shemp, reminiscent of laurel & hardy's "berth marks" and the marx brothers famous stateroom scene in "night at the opera - here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine). i'm not a huge stooges fan, but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts.
