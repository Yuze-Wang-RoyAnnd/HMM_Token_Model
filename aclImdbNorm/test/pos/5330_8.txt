don't let any reviews (critics, imdb users or mine) influence you seeing this movie. i read only the plot premise and became intrigued. after watching, this movie, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. it gives a perspective on life that many have probably not contemplated. its is not however, as leland himself says, a movie that "can be wrapped up in a neat package with a bow and everything." other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible. quite obviously they missed the entire point of the movie, which is disappointing. to say the least.<br /><br />in short, it is a well acted, well directed movie. the story is not a feel good one, but i feel if you don't come away from the movie feeling good, you may just have missed something. to characterize it as "art house" is unfair, in my opinion, but as our society likes labels, this is probably the one that fits. if you find you know everything there is to know about the world... i'd suggest skipping this one. if you feel movies should be a form of escape "from the world"... you won't find it here. but if you do watch it... you just might find something in yourself.
