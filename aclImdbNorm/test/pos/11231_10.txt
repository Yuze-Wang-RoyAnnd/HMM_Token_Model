a dreamy, stunningly atmospheric film takes place in a small town of northfork, montana in 1955. the government officials arrive to evacuate the town about to be inundated by a new hydroelctrical dam. there are the other visitors in the town, the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy irvin. a local priest (nick nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them...<br /><br />there is some unearthly quality in the film, some dignified mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness. <br /><br />i cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as "northfork" did, the film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. even now, after several weeks since i saw it, tears come to my eyes when i only think of it.<br /><br />after i saw it, i had to talk to somebody about it. i sent a pm to one of my friends and i asked, "please tell me what i just saw?" and my friend replied with the words, "you just saw one of the greatest films of modern times. one of these days others will see the light."
