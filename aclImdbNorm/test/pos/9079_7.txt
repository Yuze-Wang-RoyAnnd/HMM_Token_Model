someone i know said that there was this film called flatliners that was probably up my street. i was told about this movie after watching final destination 2 and watching the extra feature about near deth experience.<br /><br />i bought the dvd of flatliners at the modest price of 5 pounds. got home and watched it. and i could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this film hadn't been in my life before. the film is about a group of medical students try to see what it's like after near death experience. but then there sins come back in reality and can harm them physically.<br /><br />acting from kevin bacon and keifer sutherland is great as you would expect from the pair. and joel schmacheur made this a great movie like he did with the lost boys.<br /><br />this is an edgy and stylish thriller bound to please nay type of film fan.
