i caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me. this was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen, yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. alan rickman is an excellent "bad guy" but this character beats all others. i've never been so affected by a movie! it's been 6 years and i still can't forget "closet land."
