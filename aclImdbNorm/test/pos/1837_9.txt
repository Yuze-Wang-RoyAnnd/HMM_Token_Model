i love this movie. at first, i didn't expect much of this movie since i didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres. i also didn't think david and minnie would make a good on-screen couple. (i've expected a lot out of on-screen couples since i saw "you've got mail" and "sleepless in seattle" with tom hanks and meg ryan.) personally, i think joely richardson should've played minnie's part and vice versa. i don't know, i just think joely should've stayed in the movie longer with david. they seemed perfect for each other. but it just figures that in a movie, the girl next door always gets the guy. :) (like in "while you were sleeping".) i was very wrong though. this movie was fantastic!!! everything was done brilliantly. bonnie hunt did a great job of directing. the lines were perfect with the wise cracks everywhere.<br /><br />***warning: spoilers ahead!!!***<br /><br />i love how everything intertwined with each other. for example, in the beginning, elizabeth and bob were talking about going to italy, and in the end, bob meets grace in italy. sydney (the ape) doing the hand thing with grace like he had done with elizabeth is an example too.<br /><br />***notice: spoilers end now!!!***<br /><br />one thing i didn't like about the movie was it was a little unrealisitic. well, i just don't think a man could get over his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been with his entire life. you'd think he'd isolate himself from the world for years before even coming out of his house to talk someone. instead, he goes on a blind date a year later and falls *instantly* in love with a woman he's never seen in his life but feels a connection with.<br /><br />over all, it was a splendid movie. it had me crying two or three times, and it had me laughing countless times (the scene in the restaurant with bob's picky date for bottled water was hilarious!). it is definitely up there with great romantic-comedies like "you've got mail", "sliding doors", and "while you were sleeping".<br /><br />go rent it today!!
