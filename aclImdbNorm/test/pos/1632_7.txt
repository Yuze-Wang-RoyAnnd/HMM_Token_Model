i read angels and demons about 3 years ago, and i can honestly say to is one of the few books that i couldn't put down while reading.<br /><br />the movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. tom hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of professor langdon than in the da vinci code.<br /><br />you won't have to worry about this being as bad as the da vinci code, this is everything that it wasn't. much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy. if you haven't read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting. and if you have read the book, well lets say you might be a little let down because i found many scenes missing that i was looking forward to.<br /><br />overall, pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer. but, maybe not something too special for dan brown fans.
