"the couch trip" is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the '80s. in this case, dan aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and he goes to beverly hills to sub for charles grodin. most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at beverly hills and people's empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).<br /><br />it's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time. don't expect any kind of religious experience. but you'll most likely laugh a lot at how the beverly hills people flaunt their wealth. also starring walter matthau, donna dixon, arye gross and victoria jackson (of "uhf").
