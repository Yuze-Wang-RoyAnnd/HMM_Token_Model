in victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country. the children adapt to their new situation, make friends, and enlist the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help reunite their family.<br /><br />actors who direct movies are often not very good at it. jeffries however, the great veteran actor of dozens of british comedy classics, is one of the few exceptions. his brilliant conception (he also wrote the script, from the novel by e. nesbit) of a classic british children's story is what raises this film to art. whilst the story may be highly idealised, the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative yorkshire dales settings combine to make a truly memorable movie. the photography by arthur ibbetson is the definition of good movie-making - not a shot is wasted in telling the story but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. agutter is simply perfect as the kind-hearted bobbie (okay, i fell in love with her at an early age, but i defy anyone to disagree) and cribbins, whose comic acting pedigree is on a par with jeffries, is unforgettable as perks the humble-yet-proud railway porter. this is a film out of time; romantic, charming, hugely enjoyable and with a beautifully naive sense of good-hearted kindness towards all.
