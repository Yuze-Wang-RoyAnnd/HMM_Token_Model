i was @ 13 yrs of age when i saw this greatly underappreciated film at the adams theatre in newark, nj, i purchased the program, and later bought the soundtrack... still have both.... i am now 55 + yrs.. and have not seen it since (possibly once on network tv, in 1960's???) one of the greatest casts ever assembled, great score and production , please let another generation see this great film... it was my introduction to opera, and aided with my understanding of tolerance.. please family of gerswhins or premingers, release this classic soon !!
