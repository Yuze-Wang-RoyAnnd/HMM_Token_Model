"dead man walking" is a film not about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death penalty case -- the killer, the families whose kids were killed, the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor, and what happens. it tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. i have it on dvd, and every time i watch it (not often, it's never an easy film to watch) i'm more impressed by what tim robbins and the entire cast did here. so revealing that it could be a documentary, so compelling you can't take your eyes away, so subtle and yet so powerful... "dead man walking" is nothing short of a masterpiece. it doesn't matter whether you're for or against the death penalty (or even have no opinion), this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure. it takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once, and everyone involved in the film pulls it off -- there isn't a single scene that rings false. a masterful film, but don't expect light viewing... to some, the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable, even though no blood or violence is shown. you get drawn into this film and become a participant, and there's a character for just about everyone to identify with. 10/10.
