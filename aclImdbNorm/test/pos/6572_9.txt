anand is one of those low-budget but well taken movies. it's a "cup of coffee" entertainment, with no violence, blood or "jump out of your seat" excitement which most telugu films have. however, it does have some massala of it's own. roopa is a headstrong and down-to-earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation, even her offensive mother-in-law's distaste for her. she even backs out of the wedding because her fianc'e doesn't stand up for her. however, her air of confidence and independence is enough to make anand, a rich young gentleman living in the city, aspire to be her new husband. his father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways, so why not pay her back? but roopa is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior, she puts him through a bunch of situations, continuing to be rude and a pain. it's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too. but complications ensue
