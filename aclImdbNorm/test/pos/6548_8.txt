having discovered the ring trilogy, i have been greedily gobbling up all those other japanese and korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon.<br /><br />i don't have an easy definition of horror, but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons, even though i can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense. i'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when i just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen. the film unnerved me so i became apprehensive of seeing things that i thought i was going to see.<br /><br />it's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually. it also provides food for thought. and plenty of material to argue about when the film is over.<br /><br />the characters are well-defined to say the least. could they make films like this in the west?<br /><br />so it doesn't make sense in the end, but when one has an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the bizarre, the otherworldly, then no film is going to deliver a final all-explaining pay-off.
