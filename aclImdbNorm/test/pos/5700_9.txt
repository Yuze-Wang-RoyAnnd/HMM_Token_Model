what a wonderful documentary - i sat down thinking this would be a rehash of the bitchy stories told in easy riders, raging bulls, but it is, in fact, a clear-eyed, glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that spawned some truly great movies. what struck me was the lack of bitterness apparent in the director interviews, given that now the movie business sucks in a large fashion - instead, folk like friedkin and coppola's eyes seem to positively glitter recalling their glory days. the footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the exorcist was priceless. 'it was - traumatic,' one guy says. a great epitaph for the late ted demme, a thrilling film, i just wish it was longer - i could have sat through a three hour cut of this.
