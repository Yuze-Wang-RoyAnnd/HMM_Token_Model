attend the tale of sweeney todd...the strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful broadway musical. it is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. george hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while angela lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. if you just allow yourself to enjoy it, "sweeney todd" is a real treat.
