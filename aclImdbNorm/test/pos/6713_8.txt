tobe hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'poltergeist') aims for the skies this time around. 'lifeforce' is an adaptation of colin wilson's 'the space vampires'. the script by 'alien's dan o' bannon and don jakoby) varies a bit i was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and hailey's comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by earth a few weeks after the films release (so i've read).<br /><br />the story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by steve railsback) sent to investigate hailey's comet as it passes by earth. all goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. the team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. the crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow.<br /><br />a bit later the ship returns to earth but no contact can be made by nasa and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. upon docking with the churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. but the three humanoids remain. however it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown.<br /><br />soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. if you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. the goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well.<br /><br />thankfully the commander survives re-entry in the pod (crash lands in texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness, the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed london dry of their souls.<br /><br />tobe hooper (of 'the texas chain saw massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. the production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. production designer john graysmark (fresh off 'the bounty (1984)') uses every bit of four stages at elsree studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. cinematographer alan hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'star wars vi: return of the jedi' (1983) and three consecutive james bond episodes. hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. oscar winner john dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'star wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. heck even maestro henry mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. in the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of steve railsback and newcomer mathilda may (vampire queen). railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. that comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. gorgeous french actress may doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. job accomplished and where do i sign up to be victim? i really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clich'es and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. almost everything is accounted for here: bats (their true form resembles a large bat), coffins {the stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal (miss may
