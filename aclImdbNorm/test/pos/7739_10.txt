what will be prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? why a man would need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girl friend? because it is too hard to live and love in good conditions in "civilisation". this man (john cassavetes) is a broken hearted giant, he can command the storm. he's got the power, the strengh but he is human. deep love of life is the subject of this extraordenary movie. the acting is incredible, all the genius of john cassavetes, gena rowlands, vittorio gasman and shakespeare and paul mazursky of course. don't miss it it'll be a mistake this film is one of the most beautiful i've ever seen.and i've seen a lot of movies.
