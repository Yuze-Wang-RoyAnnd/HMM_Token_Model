another asian horror movie packed with intense, and creepy moments. another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot, which is here as well. major spoiler warning!<br /><br />the movie starts pretty simple - two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself. the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the elder one - and they seem to ignore their father. all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father. then it hits you, "your sister has been dead for years now" it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn't know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well.as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sister's alter ego) is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in! i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there.<br /><br />finally - my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack. very creepy! 7 out of 10
