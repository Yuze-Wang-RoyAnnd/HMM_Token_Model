when i started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the action channel,i have to say out of all the shows that i've seen that adv released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. i had to see it again,and that's when i got my chance. i bought the entire box set of this series at best buy for my 20th birthday. and i got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that i missed on action channel,and the same 3 episodes that i've seen. my favorite characters in this show are: sylvia,leon,and nigel. the animation in this series was the best,and the hard suits were cool as well. but the show also has a great voice cast like:chris patton,jason douglas,christine auten,and hillary haag,and more. so if you like this show on action channel,then you have to own it on dvd. it's the best,and you will see what i mean.
