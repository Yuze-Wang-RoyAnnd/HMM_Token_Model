i just got back from the glbt film festival at the amc loews 34th in ny. a friend told me about this film. audience response was very positive! lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization. top notch in every area. a movie that makes you think, and then makes you realize how lucky we'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt. i imagine this will come close to, if not win, the audience favorite award! what was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize. there isn't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group, just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with.
