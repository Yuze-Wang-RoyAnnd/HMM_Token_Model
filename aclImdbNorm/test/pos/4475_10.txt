what an incredible story and what a beautiful film! hat's off to ben daniels, lavinia currier and the great honore de balzac. this captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. i watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. this film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world. both are capable of affection, yet ironically, it's the more "evolved" one who becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the other's freedom. it's one of the most fascinating and intriguing look at the many forms of love, and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be sometimes. <br /><br />only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality.
