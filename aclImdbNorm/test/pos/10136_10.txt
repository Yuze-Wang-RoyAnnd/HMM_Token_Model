this is one of the best films i have ever seen! how anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination! first of all, gooding's and harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially gooding. that is the only way i can describe the acting: spectacular! you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off; then you see gooding, and his performance was magical. as for the plot, since it was based on a true person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. for all the action buffs, it might be a little slow, but then it's not an action film. i definitely give this movie a 10. it deserves nothing less!
