this neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century american films that all seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highway and, of course, plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course. the actors are the best reason to see "black day, blue night." there is the late, great j.t. walsh ("swing blade," "pleasantville," "red rock west," "the last seduction," and many more), who did many neo-films noirs (see also "breakdown"). then there is michele forbes of the tv series "star trek: the next generation" and "homicide." (in a supporting role, there is even the late bejamin lum who also appeared on a star trek episode titled "the naked now.") a spoiler of sorts--a clue really: only the most innocent survive, but innocence is a very relative term in a movie like this, and you probably won't guess who is innocent before the final reel.
