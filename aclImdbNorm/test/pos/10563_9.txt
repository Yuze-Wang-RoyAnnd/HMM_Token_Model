the story was well plotted and interesting by itself. however, it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you. to avoid that, i am not going to talking the story here.<br /><br />i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah water's book, as compared with the previous one "tipping the velvet". i read the book first and then watched the dvd later. the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. of course, due to the time limitation, the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book. therefore, it couldn't illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr. ibbs's place and those after that (even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene). despite that, the film actually did a good job in representing the story. it really worth watching. it's still unclear when bbc-america can broadcast this film. that's pity.<br /><br />ps: noticed that the ages of maud and sue were set to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses.
