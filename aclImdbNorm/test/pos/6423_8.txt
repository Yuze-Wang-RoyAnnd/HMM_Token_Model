i saw this movie many years ago, have tried to locate it but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found. it was so esoteric, & yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time. i am still not sure what the reality of the movie is, and perhaps, like the uncertainty principle, the obscurity is the definite thing. acting is superb, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding, an overall melancholiness permeates, & yet, it is hard not to be absorbed in the story. i rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the sci-fi section with some totally misleading blurb), but quite clearly it is not. or horror, or even suspense. in fact, one feels thankful the director took the courage to make a movie like this, for which obviously there is no solid audience. i know some people have complained about klaus kinski's short role, but i think it is very appropriate - his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery of this movie.
