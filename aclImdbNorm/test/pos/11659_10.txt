i really enjoyed this movie. it challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a true piece of artwork in my book. the acting was unsurpassed. i would never watch this movie with anyone i could not cry around, i don't think i cry harder to any movies, maybe because it makes me look at myself, i dunno. it is a must see.
