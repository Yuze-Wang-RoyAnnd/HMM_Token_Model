this show is actually pretty good. like all shows on tv, it has its good episodes and its bad ones.<br /><br />i have read where people compare this show to married with children, and i suppose it is a similar show for the new generation. however, because of what was expected and allowed on tv in the days of married with children, that show was taken to great extremes to show that it was in fact, a television show, and not meant to be take seriously.<br /><br />the war at home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic. the parents talk to each other like real life parents often do, telling their children one thing, when they will turn around and do the opposite.<br /><br />sure, some of the content can be considered controversial. but i find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. like it or not, there are a lot of families out there just like this one.<br /><br />every episode does teach a 'valuable lesson'. its just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution for every problem that a family may encounter, and sometimes the solution is to pick the lesser of two evils. we all know that in some cases, as a parent, the only goal you can have is to keep your kids out of really big trouble, and hope that they learn right from wrong.<br /><br />i respect the writers for attempting to keep the show true to life, instead of having some magical ending like the cleaver family always had.
