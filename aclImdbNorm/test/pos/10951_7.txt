a vampire prince falls for a human girl, unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter. that's the underlying theme of this martial arts romp which borrows ideas from "underworld" and "buffy the vampire slayer" but manages to maintain a style of its own. i was bemused by the uk and hong kong title "the twins effect" as there are no twins involved in the story. it turns out that the two main female characters are played by hong kong pop stars who perform as "the twins". don't let this put you off. these girls can act (at least well enough for this type of film) and add a lot of charm to the proceedings. jackie chan turns up for a couple of cameo appearances adding a dash of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the proceedings. all in all this is great fun for those who like their vampires served up with a helping of tongue-in-cheek humour.
