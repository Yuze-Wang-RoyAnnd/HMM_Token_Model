it came before "the ten commandments" "land of the pharaohs" "ben hur" and it's overlooked today.how unfair!based on mika waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (i hope it will be done some day).waltari,whose message is essentially christian remains intact(another of his books "the secret of the kingdom" (first part) takes place after christ's death in the holy land).<br /><br />"the egyptian" is the rising of a monotheism close to christianism long before christ:the pharaoh(wilding) is some kind of messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world:he asks to return good for evil!and he has disciples ,who will eventually turn into martyrs (the scene when simmons and the other worshippers of the sun god are slain is visually stunning,looking like some pagan ballet).for the priests ,on the other hand,this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the populace,and that's why they look for a strong man (mature)who can lead the army against the hittites as well as against their dangerous compatriots.another religion,or non-religion should we say, is sinouh'e's (purdom)who during two hours believes in nothing (the sequence of the grain of sands is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum !!)<br /><br />there's another fascinating side:the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama.not only for the screenplay (notably pharoah's sister's (tierney)final revelation which predates "the ten commandments" by two years),but also the splendor of the cinematography:viviani ,in his book about curtiz,talks about a baudelairian atmosphere ,blue and gold,notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute (darvi)who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath,supreme narcissism. around the hero,all the characters appear,disappear,appear again,but when they reappear ,they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill.besides,as such is often the case in "modern " melodramas ,the story is a long flashback,framed by two short sequences showing sinouh'e an old man who's remembering.<br /><br />this is a wonderful sword and sandals,that had a strong influence,not only in america but also in europa,notably in poland where jerzy kawalerowicz directed a spellbinding "faraon" (1966) which owed a lot to curtiz.
