i saw this movie at the philadelphia film festival today and enjoyed it overall. it is an interesting and adept analysis of the all-too-common revelation that our parent's marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined. in addition, this movie is an excellent example of process of discovering truths about our parent's lives after their death and the issues associated with that. however, i found the sound quality (recording and editing) to be relatively poor and annoying. *** it may very well have been related to the specific theater and projection conditions *** i am not a film maker / student or anything and claim no real understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer, i found the audio portion of the movie distracting. specifically, i heard very unpleasant lip smacking noises through out (especially one long interview with the younger sister) the film, and often the background noise level was higher in volume than people's voices (for example the scene when a small group was sorting through the mothers papers). has anyone else seen this movie, noticed anything about the sound... thanks
