hair is one of my favorite movies of all times. even not being part of my generation, i already watched this movie 9 times and i can't get enough with the beautiful message of understanding,passion,beauty and love. this movie is against the vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the color,origins, religions and classes. i love the characters berger and woof and i think central park of the 70's one of the most beautiful places i already saw in my life.<br /><br />by the way,i still have this music in my mind:<br /><br />when the moon is in the seventh house and jupiter aligns with mars then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars<br /><br />this is the dawning of the age of aquarius the age of aquarius aquarius! aquarius!<br /><br />harmony and understanding sympathy and trust abounding no more falsehoods or decisions golden living dreams of visions mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation aquarius! aquarius!<br /><br />ps: i am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of amadeus. i just love both movies!
