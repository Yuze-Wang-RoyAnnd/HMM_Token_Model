uzumaki succeeds as at plunging you into a bizarre surreality where uzumaki shapes haunt and curse a town. it fails at being a competent horror movie. while the film is sure to draw attention mainly to it's bizarre plot line and a few interesting visual treats, it's going to come off better as a dark comedy than a horror film. it's definitely a film you should see if your into the kind of stuff- but if your looking for a scare or even a small chill, you'll want to look elsewhere. uzumaki doesn't really have much else up it's sleeve but a great chain of odd events.<br /><br />a
