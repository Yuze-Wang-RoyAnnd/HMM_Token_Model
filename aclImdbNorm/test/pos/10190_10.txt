this program was on for a brief period when i was a kid, i remember watching it whilst eating fish and chips.<br /><br />riding on the back of the tron hype this series was much in the style of streethawk, manimal and the like, except more computery. there was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy - automan. he'd go around solving crimes and the lot.<br /><br />all i really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally.<br /><br />when i mention it to anyone they can remember very little too. was it real or maybe a dream?
