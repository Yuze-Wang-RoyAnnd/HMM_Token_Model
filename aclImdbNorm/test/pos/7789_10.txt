i love this film. shehzad khan's portrayal as bhalla a.k.a. "shut up, robert!" was so hilarious. whenever he got hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal. viju khote is the dumbfounded robert a.k.a. "rabbit". i love that shakti kapoor a.k.a. "crime master gogo". paresh rawal's double role is so awesomely hilarious for his portrayal as ramgopal bajaj & shyamgopal bajaj. raveena tandon and karishma kapoor are out of this world. my brother does a really good mimicry of bhalla saying. "relax. please relax." i love the scene in which aamir khan puts a laxative in salman "muscles" khan's food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times.
