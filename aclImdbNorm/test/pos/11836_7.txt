this is one of the better marion davies talkies - and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films. ok, so she does a clunky tap number, but even ruby keeler's dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations. the problem here is the script. the story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel. it's quite stagey, and is obviously adapted from a play... but not well enough. still, there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout. worth a look.
