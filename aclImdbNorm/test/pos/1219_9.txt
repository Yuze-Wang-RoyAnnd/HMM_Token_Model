true love, i truly enjoyed and loved this movie. it was fun, funny and inspirational. i just saw it on dvd. how did i miss this one it's a winner! i mean flex was "that guy". i wanted to marry him. this was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off. i thought tangi miller was the best ever and i was a felicity head too. a fearless woman who only fears her nana. thank you for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great! tasha smith was a blast! aloma wright was priceless as nana. this cute romantic comedy is "a must see". oh and the new comer marcus patrick is worth the surprise ladies...true love. karen
