take someone you love or want to love and go see this film.<br /><br />it touches you in all the right places.<br /><br />all the other reviewers here have said it all.<br /><br />perhaps the cynical will not be impressed.<br /><br />they only seem to like the stuff that leaves you depressed for days.<br /><br />this film is ga-run-teed to stay with you for life.<br /><br />i am so gratified that the director is not usc trained.<br /><br />this validates my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity in film these days.<br /><br />it is because of the usc lockstep mentality and inbreeding.<br /><br />hooray for jeff hare and richard marcus, cast and crew. well done!
