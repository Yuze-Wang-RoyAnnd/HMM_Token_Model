this is screamingly funny (well, except when bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a little sad). <br /><br />ted raimi and stacy keach are both excellent and worth watching.<br /><br />sure, it's not a big budget-suit controlled blockbuster, but it's everything it promises to be and more- and btw- the women are wonderful in their parts, though i don't know them from other movies, i'd welcome seeing them again.<br /><br />the two-brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for bruce's outstanding physical comedy- he is one yummy guy!<br /><br />thanks bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!
