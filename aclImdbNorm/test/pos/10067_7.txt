i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism. i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny. the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it. i also like madonna's character and i do not agree that she played herself. she has created a character and a sympathetic one. <br /><br />my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love. the humour in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and perhaps it is not everybody's cup of tea. but it's their problem, not of the film. <br /><br />i found this film wholesome and sunny. in fact, the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day. and madonna can act. just take off your glasses of negative thinking.
