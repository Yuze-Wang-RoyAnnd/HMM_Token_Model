since watching the trailer in "the little mermaid ii: return to the sea" dvd, i had a feeling that this movie is gonna be great 'cause i am a huge disney fan. and guess what? i'm right! this movie is a very worthy successor to the original classic "lady and the tramp".<br /><br />it tells the story of scamp, lady and tramp's mischievious son scamp, who wants to be wild and free instead of living a housedog life. though the movie might not be as good as the first one, it has a great moral that you couldn't find anywhere else until you watch it.<br /><br />i admit that the movie isn't for everyone, but those of you who hate it, all i can say is that you don't have a spirit for this and i suggest that you shouldn't go see it again. but hey! it's really an awesome story, packed with brilliant animation, music, and star-studded voice talents featuring scott wolf(party of five) and alyssa milano(charmed). so if you haven't seen the movie, why standing there? go and grab the copy!!!
