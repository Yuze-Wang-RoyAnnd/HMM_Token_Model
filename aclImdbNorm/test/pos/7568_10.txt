zeke rippy (mic) is great, you totally believe his character. and it's scary as hell, i spent half the movie covering my eyes, the other half on the edge of my seat. it's cool to see something this suspenseful and frightening that isn't all blood and guts - but it did give me bad dreams.<br /><br /> basically this is a great movie - see it the first chance you get.
