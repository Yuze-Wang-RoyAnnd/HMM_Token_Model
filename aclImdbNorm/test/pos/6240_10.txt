this is fantastic! everything from the score - to when the final credits role. this movie is a masterpiece. it's genuinely creepy and its effectively hysterical setting is enough to give anyone the creeps. it is apparent that the movie was not rushed, and that david schmoeller (who would later work with fullmoon on the puppet master series) had a clear and concise image of what he is trying to direct. the professional aspect of the movie is astonishing considering it's relatively low budget. it relies on scares without effects (mainly due to budget restrictions) but still creates a tension filled atmosphere.<br /><br />stephen king stated that this was one of his favorite movies and i seriously cannot blame him! it's one of my favorite horror movies and always will be. this is my favorite fullmoon movie and has been ever since i first purchased a good few years ago.<br /><br />money well spent! i own both vhs and dvd versions.<br /><br />10/10
