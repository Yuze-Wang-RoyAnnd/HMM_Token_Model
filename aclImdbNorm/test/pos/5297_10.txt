miyazaki's studio ghibli shows his wonderful touch animating, infusing life, in every little action of the characters in ponyo. when sosuke puts down so carefully his little boat to reach for the red fish you know that you'll have a very good time watching this movie. <br /><br />the characters are interesting and you really care for them. they recall visually other stories, riisa seems a grown up nausicaa with a son, an old lady in wheelchair remembers the witch in howl's moving castle.<br /><br />the presence of the elements, wind, rain, and the sea with its great, powerful waves, is so strong that i think it has never been evoked in such a way in any other movie. it is a simple story, loosely inspired by "the little mermaid", and it reach for the very heart of the audience, just like totoro, the other miyazaki's true masterpiece. <br /><br />an instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits. don't miss it.
