"don't torture a duckling" is one of the coolest italian horror films i've ever seen, and i've seen my share. to call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. it's more of a straight horror movie.<br /><br />complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school italian feel. the setting is perfect: an old italian village. the music is ridiculously perfect. the finale is genuine and original.<br /><br />after seeing "don't torture a duckling" you really have to wonder how fulci's later stuff got so off beat. i like all his stuff, but he strayed. maybe he figured he already did it...because with this film, he hits the bullseye.<br /><br />i'd recommend this film to anyone who thinks that dario argento owns the giallo genre. fulci beats him with this one. <br /><br />10 out of 10, kids.
