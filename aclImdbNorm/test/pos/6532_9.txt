i know what most of people will think about this movie without even seen it... 'the typical movie from a famous singer... it will be a pink movie,a teenage film,it will be stupid...' and stuff like that... and yes, it is...i mean, it's a pink movie... but, you know what?...i loved it. seriously...it's a very romantic film... i think that every girl in this world has dreamed with something like the plot of 'popstar'... met his favorite singer, know him as a person...and even have a romance with him...right? ^^ i really enjoyed watching that... in addition, it's really funny... <br /><br />i think the actors did a great job... there's a lot of loving characters...and, aaron carter (jd) is not the exception... to be honest, in the first five minutes of see him act, i thought 'this will be awful'...but then , he surprised me really pleasingly...<br /><br />also, i gotta say that the music performances on the film are great! i specially loved the part when jd ( aaron) sings without music , (only with a guitar) a very beautiful song...this guy is really talented... time will tell...<br /><br />my advice to you?...watch it! don't make a prejudice ;-)
