this is not the masterpiece that is snow white, cinderella, or bambi, but it is a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done disney animated feature.<br /><br />there are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.<br /><br />while this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the classic disney romcom adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the aristocats. o'malley is the "tramp" and dutchess is the "lady," but dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.<br /><br />phil harris is our tomcat o'malley. you may recognize his voice, as he also furnished the voice of baloo the bear in the jungle book, and little john in disney's robin hood. eva gabor lends her silky sweet voice to dutchess.<br /><br />directed by wolfgang reitherman, who directed, or worked on, every disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985.<br /><br />this is among my very favorite of the disney animated feature films, and belongs in any disney collection. the 2-disk special edition is due out this summer (2007).<br /><br />this rates an 8.4/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
