christian duguay directed this tidy little espionage thriller early in his career. it plays on tv pretty regularly, albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed. i finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a $3 tape from the local video store. naval officer aidan quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious carlos the jackal, and gets a little too caught up in the role. donald sutherland ben kingsley play quinn's superiors, with sutherland a true zealot and kingsley as the more level-headed one. the first half of this fun flick shows quinn being trained and indoctrinated. the second half has him out in the field, making love to the jackal's woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies. the idea is to make the jackal look like a turncoat to the russians, and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin. things don't exactly play out as planned. at times, i almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue, but they all play it very straight. in the end, this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention. the jackal's former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her, alone is worth the price of admission.
