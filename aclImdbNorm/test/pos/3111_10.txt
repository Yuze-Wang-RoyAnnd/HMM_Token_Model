i loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by candace and jacqueline. however, i never knew until now, watching a bette david marathon on tnt that this film is a remake of a 1943 bette davis classic called old acquaintance. bette co-stars with miriam hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because bette had had an affair with miriam's husband who directed her in a film before they made old acquaintance.<br /><br />anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. i highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. it's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.
