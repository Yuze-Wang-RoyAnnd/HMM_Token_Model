i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite tv channels.... i was hooked from the very first minute. nothing is as it first seems, lots of suspense, great acting from mr. van dien, and i did not mind the "heat" in it one bit ;-) ... and, best of all: you are in for a surprise ending!!!
