i absolutely loved this movie! it's my number one favorite. although there were a few flaws (what movie doesn't have flaws?), this movie was very well written, directed, and produced. the characters in this movie are very real and believable. they made all of the characters fit into a specific role. i think that the most apparent thing about "here on earth" was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie. it's not one of those movies where you just can't seem to relate to anything, because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in. there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it. i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it. it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time. "here on earth" will make you laugh, cry, and sometimes angry. i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
