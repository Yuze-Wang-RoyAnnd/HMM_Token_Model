the writers of lost have outdone themselves. season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? he will have to if he wants to stay alive. i don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge. this finale has left more questions than the previous finale; and i can't wait for fall.<br /><br />a side note: what is the point in posting a review just to write out all the spoilers? where is the pleasure in ruining the surprise for everyone else? the current review on this page is nothing but a big fat spoiler fest, poorly constructed in barely readable english with the express purpose of making someone mad. good job.
