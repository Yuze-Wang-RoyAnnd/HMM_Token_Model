i have been trying to track the age of kings down for many, many years.my theater life was filled with the actors in this series. at the time, in 1960 i was not able to follow all of it, as i was myself working in the theater, lots of night work. now in retirement i long to have this and keep it to myself. please, please can it not be issued on dvd, i would not mind what it cost. i see that there are others out there who feel the same. what can we do to get this done? something as great as this should not be sent into oblivion. i have to write two more lines. ok i can do that by saying that i want this series more than anything in the world. just to be able to watch some of the finest actor of our age playing out the finest words of our wonderful shakespeare. isn't that enough! a uzmen
