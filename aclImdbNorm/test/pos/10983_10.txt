if hollywood had the wellbeing of the audience at heart we would see 20 films a year with the kind of wholesome fortitude that is behind this film. there are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the lessons learned are not that greed will profit you, or do-unto-others-whatever-you-want-as-long-as-you-are-okay-with-it, no, this is what our sad, desensitized lives need, more sense... more love... more do-unto-others-as-you-would-have-done-unto-you... more hope. (thanks ursula!) this movie has an intelligent wit, not "yo' mama" cracks that run rampant in the so-called comedies. people need to feel good. this movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to better your life, and the lives of others. sidenote every person counts in ticket sales. this is a truly independent film. if you want more quality films you have to support them.
