the kite runner should win an oscar! it's perfect in every sense, the story, the script, the acting, the cinematography... one would never guess it was filmed in china. the story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression. the depiction of life in afghanistan under the taliban is all too real and horrifying. i have not read the book, but i have seen comments that put down the movie because "the book is always better"... it doesn't really matter. no one put down "gone with the wind" because it wasn't true to the book! as a matter of fact, it won the academy award for best picture and several other oscars. i think this movie is brilliant - bravo to the writer and director, and the actors!
