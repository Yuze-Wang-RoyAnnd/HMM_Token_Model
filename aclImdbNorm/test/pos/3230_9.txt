text taken from 2001 melbourne international film fest guide.<br /><br />fuckland the title is a pun based on the film's lead actor fabian stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.<br /><br />fabian is an argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. his master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half argentinians. fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eyed perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy.
