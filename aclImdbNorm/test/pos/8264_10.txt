i was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama, both parts, when it originally aired on masterpiece theatre. i loved it but lost it. then one day, while going through old tapes, found it again. i recorded it to dvd and watched and --- wow! i still love it! the leads are excellent and my only complaint is i wish we had seen more kester! what a man! and prue. she's so strong and wonderful ... living in a time and age where her affliction and how she deals with it is seen as unfortunate and evil. even her own brother tells prue to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her. *sigh* unfortunately my copy is not the greatest, with wear and tear over the years, and i too would absolutely love to own this on professional dvd if it ever happens.
