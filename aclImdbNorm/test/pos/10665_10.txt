battleship potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. the direction of<br /><br />eisenstein is truly a sight. the film chronicles a ship of disgruntled<br /><br />sailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers.<br /><br />eventually, the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send the<br /><br />officers packing. during this time period, there was a shortage of film<br /><br />stock in the soviet union. the goverment wanted to get their message<br /><br />out to the people so they started a national film company and one of<br /><br />the members was sergei eisenstein. the films were shot on miniscule<br /><br />budgets and the shortage of film stock forced eisentein to be careful<br /><br />and selective with the footage that he shot. in the end, eisenstein had<br /><br />to reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture.<br /><br />the most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the much<br /><br />talked about massacre on the steps. this scene was spoofed in bananas <br /><br />and most recently in brian de palma's the untouchables. if you want to<br /><br />learn film-making, i strongly advise you to watch battleship potemkin.<br /><br />it's one of the essentials.<br /><br />a+
