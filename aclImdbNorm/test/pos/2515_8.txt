in 1937 darryl zanuck, who had recently moved from head of production at warner brothers, was trying to get his newly created company, 20th century fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at warners and the glitter palace at mgm. "this is my affair" was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century ("san francisco" "in old chicago")and in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily. the plot is fascinating. a trouble maker but heroic naval officer (robert taylor) is given a secret assignment by president mckinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing american finance. he finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot (barbara stanwyck) and must decide between love and duty.<br /><br />not everything about this vintage film works well, but overall it is a good slice of studio film-making. the plot gimmick would be borrowed by kurt vonnegut for "mother night" (the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by nick nolte) and seems quite believable, at least within the confides of studio make believe. as a fan of old movies i am always thrilled when i stumble upon one that i have never seen and "this is my affair" was no exception.
