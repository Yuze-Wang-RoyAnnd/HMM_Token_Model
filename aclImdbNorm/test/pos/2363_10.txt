i just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes i just couldn't stop laughing at! dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes, and just says the stoopidest things...but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) the beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes robbie coltrane...! not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you haven't got much else to do (like i did). you might need to hunt around for it though - i was lucky, as my local video store stocks it.
