this show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors (like the girl from boston legal and boris the butcher from snatch). even the extras and the kid, whom i thought from the commercial might be a weak link, surprised me with his skill. it's just the little things that the director needs to tweak. like the guy who does the recap of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired. having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruins the story. the only other small problem i had was that sometimes they take too long to do things, but no where near as long as some shows like prison break. anyone know when they will resume the season??
