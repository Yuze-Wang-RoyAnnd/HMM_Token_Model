"brotherhood of satan" is one of the most underrated horror films of all times.why it hasn't achieved a cult status is beyond me.this is a chilling tale of terror and witchcraft which contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in the annals of screen horror.in the small american town some children have disappeared and their parents been violently murdered.what is the cause of hysteria?the film is really eerie,some scenes are genuinely unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten.the suspense never lets up,the acting is really good,and the climax is bizarre and disturbing.check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror.absolutely recommended.
