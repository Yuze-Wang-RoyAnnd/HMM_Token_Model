during world war ii, two byelorussian (soviet russian) soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying nazis, as they trudge through snowy terrain, searching for food and safety. if you happen not to like black-and-white "foreign" films, you may still enjoy "voskhozhdeniye" (retiled in english "the ascent"). director larisa shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well, despite its being a largely introspective piece of work. her untimely death, in a car accident, made this ms. shepitko's final film, unfortunately.<br /><br />after the opening mission is declared, there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods, but shepitko and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting. leading players vladimir gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded "rybak") and boris plotnikov (as the physically wounded 'sotnikov") successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism. their allegorical performances, under shepitko's sharp direction, provide a memorable and thought-provoking take on a familiar story.<br /><br />******** voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) larisa shepitko ~ vladimir gostyukhin, boris plotnikov, lyudmila polyakova, anatoli solonitsyn
