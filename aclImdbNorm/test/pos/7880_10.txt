i really liked the movie "joe." it has really become a cult classic among certain age groups.<br /><br />the producer of this movie is a personal friend of mine. he is my stepsons father-in-law. he lives in manhattan's west side, and has a bungalow. in southampton, long island. his son-in-law live next door to his bungalow.<br /><br />presently, he does not do any producing, but dabbles in a business with hbo movies.<br /><br />as a person, mr. gil is a real gentleman and i wish he would have continued in the production business of move making.
