i managed to see the mtv premiere of this movie last night and i needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the d as it has plenty of in-jokes for those that have seen the hbo series and has more than enough d for newer fans and the mass of soon-to-be converts. the music really shines with the new songs "kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "master exploder" (possibly the 3rd best song in the world) and "dude (i totally miss you)". there are a load of excellent scenes (the car chase, the rock-off, the meeting) and cameos (including dave grohl as satan!). i really could go on for hours but i don't want to give the movie away. go see it. you won't be disappointed.
