in a word...magical. and so incredibly real. vijay raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want his characters to succeed, in whatever he does. and he plays hari om impeccably- from his absolutely perfect "bollywood e-shtyle" to his awkward, shy manner with a first kiss. he is a truly gifted actor and i wouldn't hesitate to see him in anything, because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul. camille natta is absolutely gorgeous. it took some time for me to warm up to her- possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist so well. her transition really became her and she molded into her role very well. even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend benoit, was wonderful, though you never really like him for the scum that he plays, jean-marie lamour enacts a perfect cad. the script- so real. i found myself turning to my friend repeatedly throughout the film to say, "that's exactly what happens in india! they nailed it!" very real, very raw. very bittersweet but you certainly leave the theater feeling fulfilled. music by nitin sawhney is wonderful and goes perfectly with the constantly changing moods. but vijay raaz...i find myself constantly coming back to him- because he is what makes this movie. he is the hero, the most charming, disarming rickshaw driver you will ever encounter- he's magical. a lovely, real, sweet, incredibly talented actor who i cannot wait to see shine and succeed in bollywood, hollywood or anywhere!
