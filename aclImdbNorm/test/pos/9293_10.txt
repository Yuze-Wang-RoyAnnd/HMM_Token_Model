this show is up there with the best comedys made in australia as it makes fun of pretty much anything which is what lots of our public want. some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test which tests out how an ad would do in real life. what is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people(the chasers)who love doing what they do and who would n't. this show has loads of bits in it that can crack up anybody like the ad road test which i've already mentioned, mr ten questions where he asks 10 questions really fast in front of famous celebrities like hugh jackman and the beach boys, temporary ones like the chasers emmys and ones that have been there from the start like what have we learnt from current affairs this week. overall i rate thin show 98%.
