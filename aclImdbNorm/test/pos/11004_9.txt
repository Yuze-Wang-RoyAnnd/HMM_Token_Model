this is a beautifully filmed movie that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially nomadic tribesmen. focusing on the saltmen of tibet, the film moves at pace that may make some western viewers uncomfortable. for some peoples, life still proceeds at the same pace which it has for thousands of years. this film follows a group of tribesmen on their annual two month quest to get salt. their tribe lives its life in a traditional manner (slowly by modern standards) and always accounting to their many gods. this is a remarkable film, one which will preserve a piece of what may, unfortunately, become history. well worth the time. don't be in a rush when you see it.
