i saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating. the conflict between the public and private faces of williams and the pressure he was under is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. the cast acted superbly, but michael sheen was outstanding. i only realised it was him when i saw the earlier comment. he looks completely physically different in this role, from any other role i have seen him in or as himself. williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries,as represented in this film. the film is at times distressing to watch, because of the emotional anguish displayed. however, it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly.
