i consider saboteur as hitchcock's first "american" film, because the story takes place completely in u.s.<br /><br />there are brilliant scenes in this film. statue of liberty scene, barry kane jumping into the water from the bridge, water fall scene are amazing. its not hitchcock's fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted. hitchcock originally wanted gary cooper for the leading roles in foreign correspondent and saboteur. but gary cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller. another reason why hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of top directors. although rebecca was a huge success, still most of film's success went to producer david o. selznick. for example, david o. selznick got best picture oscar for rebecca. and hitchcock didn't get a best director oscar for rebecca. hitchcock started getting some attention after foreign correspondent (1940). but universal gave him a low-budget for saboteur (1942). hitchcock tried to get joel mccrea for this film, because he was willing to work with hitchcock again with a low salary. he enjoyed working with hitchcock in foreign correspondent (1940). but he was unavailable. so the role went to robert cummings. hitchcock called robert cummings "a competent performer." i thought he did his best. he was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role.<br /><br />as for leading female role, hitchcock wanted margaret sullavan or barbara stanwyck for the leading role. they weren't interested either. so universal decided to give the role to priscilla lane. i read in a book that this was one of her favorite films.<br /><br />i also liked the scene at blind man's house. that is my favorite scene. if we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in uncle philip's house, then we will see how intense it is. uncle philip (blind man) was studying barry kane's character the moment he entered his house. the moment barry entered his house, he heard barry's handcuffs. through conversation, he realized that barry kane isn't a criminal at all. we also see his hearing ability through those scenes. for example, barry hears the sound of a car says "is that a car coming?" uncle philip says "2 cars i think." uncle philip was right. we see 2 cars in the next scene. priscilla lane did a fine job playing her role. she was no big star. but i thought her performance was really good. another brilliant scene in uncle philip's house is the scene where he asks priscilla lane (patricia martin) "are you frightened, pat? is that what makes you so cruel?" i thought otto krueger played the villain brilliantly. hitchcock wanted harry carey for the villain. but he refused. harry carey is famous for his role mr. president in "mr. smith goes to washington." i want to mention more about this film. but i think my post is getting too long.<br /><br />every hitchcock film is special in its own way. i am sure hitchcock fans will like this film. i rate 10 out of 10.
