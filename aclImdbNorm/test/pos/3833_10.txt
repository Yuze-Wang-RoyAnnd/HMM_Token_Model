despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode, the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series. and, while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun, i really do have to cast my vote as this romulan episode as being the very best.<br /><br />the movie, interestingly enough, is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked romulan ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on federation outposts. in so many ways, the show is much like the film the enemy below--where the american captain (robert mitchum) and the german captain (curt jurgens) are shown in counter-point as they both try to outwit the other--and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe.<br /><br />interestingly enough, only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet--and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull. but, because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well (shatner and mark leonard as the romulan leader). oddly, for the die-hard trekkers out there, they'll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock's father.<br /><br />the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
