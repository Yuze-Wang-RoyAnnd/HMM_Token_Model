betty is as an understudy in a production of verdi's macbeth who is asked to go on when the diva is hurt in a car accident. however, in the grand tradition of "the scottish play", the production seems cursed with problems, not least of which is some madman slicing up the crew. unfortunately for betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ...<br /><br />this is one of several must-see argento mad-slasher flicks, in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman ronnie taylor. i haven't measured it, but i reckon around two-thirds of the shots in this film involve either pans, dollies, tracking or cranes - the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller. the imagery is wild and dizzying - closeups of the heroine's eyes forced open with nails, a swooping glide around an opera house from a raven's point of view, shots of the killer's brain squirming, a bullet fired through a peephole, a swallowed chain dug out of a victim's trachea. conceptually it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director. the movie isn't without some shortcomings though; the cast are variable at best - marsillach and barberini are both a bit shaky (and his dubbing in the english version is appalling, even by italian standards), although argento regular nicolodi is fun and charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical (a horror director much maligned for his remoteness and reliance on technique). the material is a nice three-way mix of the phantom of the opera, shakespeare and slasher flick, scripted by argento and his usual collaborator, franco ferrini, with shifty suspects galore and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain what's actually going on. full of all sorts of different music - brian eno, claudio simonetti, bill wyman, puccini, and of course, verdi. the scenes in the beautiful opera-house were shot at the teatro regio in parma. for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera.
