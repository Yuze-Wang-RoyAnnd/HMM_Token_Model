it's possible to have a good time with this film while, at the same time, regretting all that it isn't. in the 1980s, a raffish u.s. congressman (tom hanks) engineers support for afghan partisans resisting the soviet union.<br /><br />hanks is in breezy, hail-fellow-well-met form as roguish, politically incorrect charlie wilson, first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women. if only the film had the same air of insouciance; but apart from philip seymour hoffman's turn as a cynical cia agent, it tries to be perceived as patriotic too. aaron sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of wilson's tall tales. and there's an oddly unspoken subtext: wilson's afghan pals later mutated into the taliban and other anti-western groups, leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred.
