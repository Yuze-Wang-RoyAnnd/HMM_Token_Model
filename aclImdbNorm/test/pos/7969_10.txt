hard justice is an excellent action movie! the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting! for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups like they use to. well, this one is really hard-core! david bradley is really good and his character takes a pounding in the movie. he gets hit by the stick over a dozen times, gets stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again, gets beat up, recovers and is ready for more action! his character is incredibly tuff! charles napier was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! vernen wells was good! professor toru tanaka had a short and an uncredited role in hard justice! as for the action, it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the huge stand off like scene in the beginning has cars getting blown up and flipping up in mid air! there is so much that happens in the 95 minute run time. for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and fighting that this film has to offer! hard justice is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper an d plus the box is cool! there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay, half.com, amazon.com's z-shops and market place sellers! i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot ems and fighting movies and has been disappointed by other movies that have the look like a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get hard justice!
