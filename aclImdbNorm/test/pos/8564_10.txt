i gave this a 10 because it's the best film of its kind...a good old-fashioned t & a film in the shadow and spirit of "animal house." i saw this with a similar film called "swap meet" and both were good of their type...a great way to spend a saturday afternoon. let's be honest...there are more breasts in this movie than one could imagine for an r-rated movie. from beginning to end, they just seem to keep showing up on screen (sunbathing scenes, bedroom scenes and, of course, the climactic football game). also, a memorable kissing booth (kiss me, clutz!) everybody seems to be having a good time in their roles (several playboy playmates, danny bonaduce, several familiar tv and movie actors, etc.). the only complaint i have to register is that lisa london's character is called by her last name "o'hara" and not a good 1970s name like "olivia" (or even ora or ona or o...??!!). i saw this again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (pretty well endowed herself) and she couldn't believe i was actually enjoying the movie!! she was probably jealous!! again, this movie is a great way to spend a saturday afternoon...just don't think too hard!
