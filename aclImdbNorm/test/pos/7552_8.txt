four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations, only to find yourself knocked for a loop. you sort of file it away, but then you hear the song "georgia on my mind" by ray charles, and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry, almost at the same time.<br /><br />why is this film so memorable? first, at least for people who lived through it all, because it captures so well the tenor of the times - its dashed hopes, its successes, its sincerity and above all the emotional roller-coaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia. and then, the acting is just so amazing. danilow, all angst and passion, georgia, as difficult to grasp as a will 'o the wisp... but enchanting, nevertheless, and louis, the handicapped room-mate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile, because he knows only too well that it just might be his last.<br /><br />how long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story? even if they were far from perfect? the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable, but the film never moralizes, it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety... even the minor characters have a well-defined personality and a history, which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top... because that's the way life is, when you think about it. and why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character. truly an amazing and satisfying experience.
