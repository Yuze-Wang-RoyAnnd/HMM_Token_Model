ross hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on james hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in hollywood for years. group of disparate british and american individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called shangri-la, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content. some of the performances by the classy cast aren't so classy (the effervescent mood of the piece, the lilting burt bacharach-hal david tunes, as well as the lightweight direction all conspire to make the performers look just a bit silly). peter finch is the international peace keeper who becomes involved in a somewhat constipated romance with resident liv ullmann; sally kellerman is a malcontent who spits out lines like, "i got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off, so that people with their heads still on--and usually under hairdryers--could get one last kick before turning to the latest recipe"; john gieguld "as chang", an asian who learned to speak english while attending oxford, is humorously self-amused (but why no songs for chang?). hal david's dopey lyrics are sometimes jaw-dropping ("on the good ship lollipop/how did christopher columbus/sail across the sea?") and the pacing gets bogged down with all that chatter about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today. however, the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting. the two-dimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing, and the movie's silliness is infectious. it ends up being a lot of fun. *** from ****
