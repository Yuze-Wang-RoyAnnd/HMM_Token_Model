the closer she gets... is an artful documentary dealing with the death of a person i actually knew. it allows a glimpse into the private moments of the family involved in the most trying time of their lives. parents tend to support the work of their children, in this case the subject of the documentary went above and beyond. she was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son. it is a most touching work of art, weaving the serious, serene, and lighter sides of life for this family. the story is one which can make you laugh, but also cry as it addresses issues we all must face. i highly recommend this documentary to those unafraid to cry, and are willing to deal with the issue of mortality in a most human manner. this film will touch you.
