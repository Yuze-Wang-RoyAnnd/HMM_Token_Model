i have never been as surprised by a film that was this old. only "the treasure of the sierra madre" holds up this well, performance-wise. as someone that has seen heroin addiction first-hand, i was shocked at how realistic this film was. frank sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic, and heart wrenching. otto preminger's direction is perfect for the film, with long takes and a very mobile camera.<br /><br />kim novak's performance is good, as is eleanor parker's. in fact, the entire supporting cast works very well, with understated performances, as befitting this film's style. the documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date. highly recommended.<br /><br />8.0 out of 10
