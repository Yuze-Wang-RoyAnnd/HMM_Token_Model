...scratch it. just as african's created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and virgin islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands, so did urban dj's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. "scratch" is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate dj/mc contempo entertainment expression. the film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate "scratchers" with startlingly unique abilities in concert and competition where the beat meets the street. good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in sound art.
