proudly and defiantly working class porter perks(mr b.cribbins)is eventually won over by upper middle class family down on their luck. father(mr i.cuthbertson) incarcerated for treason - for which the penalty was death in those days,lest it be forgotten),mother(the very beautiful miss d.sheridan)brave and resourceful,loyal and loving,and - principally - older daughter (miss j.agutter) tottering on the cusp of adolescence - hurt and confused about the fate of her father. mr perks,like many working people of his time,will have nothing to do with anything that he considers smacks of "charity" and it is a key moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday gifts he has been given by the children do not compromise his principles. although the lovely miss agutter has received all the accolades it is mr cribbins and miss sheridan whose performances dominate "the railway children".they both know how edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. but this is basically a movie about family.in an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to ransom and be considered as "socially inept" rather than unfit to live in decent society,and when two "human beings" can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder,"family" may be seen as an old - fashioned,elitist, racist even homophobic concept,but a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels.mr cribbins' and miss sheridan's families are archetypal for the age.strong and loving,sticking together against outside influences,integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. what might seem to be a dull,preachy political tract is turned by mr lionel jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope,faith,optimism and courage. that all those attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of scorn and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than miss nesbit's. no one with more than a passing concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this quite perfect movie.
