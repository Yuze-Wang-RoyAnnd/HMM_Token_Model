the relationship between the main characters i thought was very realistic. how the two end up involved is believable. it doesn't have that whole "oh yeah right" that most hollywood movies have. not too mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of trapeze. i am a trapeze student and i love that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yeah those fabric burns are brutal! definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie. i loved it! i'm happy with the way the movie ended but i definitely wanted to see more. be sure to stay seated through the credits for a special treat hehe. great scene!
