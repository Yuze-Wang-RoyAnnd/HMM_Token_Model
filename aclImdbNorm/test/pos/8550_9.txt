this is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences, humor, and best of all a love story. anthony quinn is wonderfully casted and after seeing several of his movies, this has to be categorized as one of his best performances, besides zorba. the movie makes you really wonder if its filmed in romania, which apparently is not the case. it is sure to fool even native romanians, with its authentic-like landscape, costume, and ways of life. according to imdb it is actually shot in france and yugoslavia, hmmm. the story is compelling, making you want to watch the entire movie over, to see if you missed something. it provoked me into researching to find out if this is a truth based movie, but to my disappointment, it is a novel based film, seemingly fiction. it seems a bit far fetched to have happened for real, but one never knows.... the one problem with this film, is that it doesn't seem to cast any romanian actors, and it is a film about a romanian character. there are probably many romanian fill-ins in the beginning, but maybe not, it is filmed elsewhere. the author of the book was romanian, at least thats all fine and dandy - overall a masterpiece in cinematography.
