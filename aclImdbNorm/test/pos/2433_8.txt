making this short and to the point. this movie was great! i loved it! i actually picked this up at a hollywood video for 3 bucks on vhs and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks. i'm a big bogart fan and i just latched onto this movie. i thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone. robert sacchi is great and pulls off a good bogart. his nose is a little big, his voice is a bogart-columbo mix, and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise, he was fantastic and this film was wonderful. no one can be a perfect bogart but he was great. remember, sam marlow is a fan of bogart and isn't going to do everything he did. he mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real bogart's character's. but, it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. watch it and have fun!
