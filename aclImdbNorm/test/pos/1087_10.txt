satya was excellent.... company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. ab tak chappan however is even more entertaining. the dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. nana pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. as a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on. i've ordered my dvd and can't wait to see it again at home. as a lover of these type of gangster flicks, this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly "non-yash raj" bollywood gangster flick lovers out there.
