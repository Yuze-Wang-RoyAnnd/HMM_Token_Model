sixth (and last) movie in the boxset. well, looks like i've saved the best one for last. ghoulies iv. i originally did a review for this back in like february, but i decided to do a new one. the ghoulies series is pretty awesome. i know there are some people who don't like them, and that's fine. this happens to be my favorite one in the series. yeah, i know the actual ghoulies don't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes, one of them being tony cox from bad santa. now, onto the movie.<br /><br />the movie centers around jonathan graves, the main character from the first movie, being played once again, by peter liapis, who is now a cop for the lapd and has put his past of the occult behind him. during the first part of the movie, we encounter alexandra (played by the very hot stacie randall) communicating with a demon from beyond named faust, who is the dark side of jonathan. faust asks alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry, therefore, unleashing the ghoulies from the beyond.<br /><br />i think jim wynorski did a good job with the directing. and the music by chuck cirino is funny as well. (spoiler ahead) at the end of this movie, the ghoulies say that there will be a ghoulies iv, part 2, or ghoulies v. i still hope that sequel gets made and i especially hope jim wynorski returns to direct. i agree with gimbotheghoulies on that.
