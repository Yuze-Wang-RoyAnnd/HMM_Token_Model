cooley high is such a great film that even with the period's sound track, urban landscape, wardrobe and slang...it still doesn't feel dated. the sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself.<br /><br />instead it absorbs you right into it. that is a staple of a good movie. from start to finish it doesn't miss a beat and i never grow tired of watching it.<br /><br />it's ending is unique in the respect that it's one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings. there may have been a few since (backdraft comes to mind) but cooley was the first and much more emotional.
