this stan laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the valentino film blood and sand. if you've seen blood and sand, then you'll probably appreciate this film and laugh at a few of the scenes that mock the valentino film. however, if you have not see that movie and just watch this film, you'll probably not be very impressed--though i really liked the title cards, us the word "bull" was used repeatedly in very funny ways.<br /><br />stanly plays "vaselino" a bullfighter who seems pretty dim-witted and wins only because the bulls seem to lazy and non-aggressive. even the bull at the end of the film who has supposedly killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated bull.<br /><br />not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but still a cute and harmless film.
