with all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on "romeo and juliet"? paul and michelle are models of good behave compared to them.<br /><br />yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. paul is more sexually interested than michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it. the movie does let kids know that sex can cause babies.<br /><br />one thing, there is nudity in the movies. the camera does not focus on it, but it is there.<br /><br />the ending of the movie has paul in good chance of being found out. in "paul and michelle", they separate for a time. if you don't like the ending of a movie, think one up yourself. alternative endings are not just for dvds.
