the residents are a band known for their strange appearances and odd musical stylings, so obviously, their music videos aren't going to be exactly normal. in fact, these little videos are abnormal, and bizarre, but have a huge artistic value to them. the atmosphere is built with lighting, and thoughtful visuals. it's a great watching experience.<br /><br />basically, icky flix just consists of many residents music videos made for their songs. the music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like it's straight out of an 80s horror film. what doesn't change is the quality of these videos. they're great!<br /><br />any fan of art films will love these. they're so original with their visuals, and the angles they are filmed at, and the lighting especially make these so interesting. the music is creepy and catchy and highly original and these short films are mini-classics that deserve multiple watchings. this is a near-perfect collection of short videos.<br /><br />my rating: **** out of ****. 56 mins.
