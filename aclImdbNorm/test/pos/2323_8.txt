i saw the movie in the theater at its release, then watched the vhs tape over the years, and while strolling through target saw this dvd bundled with "pushing tin" for the exorbitant sum of $5.50.<br /><br />there is something about this comedy that has really clicked with me - how kelsey grammar, "with a tattoo on his thing", is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel sub and a crew of screwballs and misfits. he's up against the navy's best - a los angeles class nuclear attack sub - and his old captain (wm macy).<br /><br />bruce dern plays the bad guy, rip torn the admiral running the exercise - if you don't laugh hysterically during the "run silent" segment with the cook, well, you have a different kind of humor from me.<br /><br />towards the end the machinist says "d.b.f." with no explanation - it is apparently some inside knowledge gotten from an old submariner consultant - thanks to google i learned that with the advent of the nuclear subs the old salts would wear "dbf" pins - diesel boats forever. <br /><br />a navy friend said that many of the technical aspects aren't correct but who cares - it is one of the funniest movies i've seen.<br /><br />i don't think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise!
