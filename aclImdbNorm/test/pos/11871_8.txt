this movie is never going to be on a list of the top 50 films of all time, but if you're compiling a list of "fun films", this isn't a bad place to start. liv tyler is amazing, captivating and luscious, and everyone else is dead-on right for their parts. it's a 21st century counterpart to "tom jones" -- in other words; just good, bawdy fun. i think that this may be tyler's breakthrough film on her way to major stardom. with no nudity she oozes sex in this film. it's no wonder all the boys give her toys. how could they help but do that for a helpless, innocent such as liv's jewel?
