tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old-lady owner. in the same baggage car, also in a cage, is sylvester. <br /><br />in no time, sylvester has grabbed tweety but a trainman comes back and slaps the "sneakin' feline," as he calls him, back in his cage. he puts tweety "in a safer place," up high and tells the cat, "now, remember: no tricks!" sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent. yeah, right.<br /><br />i found the funniest stuff, however, didn't involve sylvester versus tweety but the "viscious dog" that is in another cage next to sylvester. the cat gets mouthy with him, and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner. sylvester just doesn't learn, but that's one reason we love him! (i know a number of imdb reviewers don't like tweety but i like both main characters - they both crack me up!)<br /><br />also, the train, and the passing scenery, is beautifully illustrated in here - really nice visuals.
