that's what i thought, when i heard about the cast of inglorious basterds. and i'm both from germany and into movies.<br /><br />that guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre tv series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. now, thanks to qt, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! he is the living proof of what a great caster tarrantino is.<br /><br />by the way: i think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a german - being able to understand everything. and the german dialog is written almost as good as the english.<br /><br />now i could repeat, what many others have written here before. i'll put it short: finally, qt is back.
