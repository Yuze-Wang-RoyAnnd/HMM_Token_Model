i watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively. anger surged in me to see the ruin of hanoi after the 12-day bombard. and by living in the country right now with my parents, who's been living in saigon for 50 years, i understand that we're much better off now, and would have been better if the american didn't bring war here. watching the movie, i learned more of the different kinds of wars that the america planned in vietnam, and what disasters they caused.<br /><br />the series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people. but i don't like it that some people only give generic opinions, like the analyst near the end of the series, i forgot his name.<br /><br />there should also be more documentary images, like the life in the army camp of the south vietnam, and those of the north (if possible). there's also a sudden change from the year of 1972 to 1975 (i'm not sure if the in-between was censored, because i watched this series on tv).
