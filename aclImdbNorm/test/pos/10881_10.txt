definitely the best game for n64 ever. i most say i was farely disappointed with tomorrow never dies, but the world is not enough promises to be better then goldeneye (according to the website).i love goldeneye so much i find something to do every time i play it. i have even made up my own missions for the levels. multi player is the best of any game out there, and the graphics are astounding even now. the first day i got this i remember wishing that they would go back, and make all of the bond movies into games. can you imagine driving that speed boat in live and let die and making those incredible jumps, or fighting off ninjas or fighting jaws in the spy who loved me and moonraker. (i think fighting him in those games would be more fun then in the aztec) what about chasing sanchez in the gas trucks or scalling st. cerils in for your eyes only. oh well let me get back to the game at hand. all of the levels are unique and make for very fun killing environments. there are many places to hide so you can sneek up on people (especially statue park) well this game is not worthy of renting you really need to buy it today.
