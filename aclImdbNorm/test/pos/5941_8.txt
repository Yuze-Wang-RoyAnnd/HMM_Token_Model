admittedly, there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic. the ravishing woman first panics and then, only a few minutes later, she starts kissing the young lad while the old guy is right next to her. but as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl (or slut) and that partly explains her behavior. the cinematography of this movie is well done. we get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension. g"otz george plays his character well, a wannabe hot-shot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the jaennicke character. wolfgang kieling who i admired in hitchcock's the torn curtain delivers a great performance that, although he doesn't say much, he is by far the best actor in this play. one critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen. but then again, how realistic are films such as mission impossible or phone booth. given the fact that we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that aren't very likely to occur in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. it's a lot better than many things that i see on german tv these days and i think that the vintage 80's style added something to this film.
