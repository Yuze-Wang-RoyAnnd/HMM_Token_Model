this is one of my favourite movies ever... i have seen it about a million times and would never turn down the opportunity to watch it again. in fact, i love it so much that i really wanted to check out the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation... does anyone know the name of it? if so, please email me!!! i watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and i was about nikki's age and for the longest time i bugged my dad to take me to away somewhere because of course i expected the same thing to happen to me! it's just such an amazing setting and such a cute puppy-love story. this is a definite dvd collector's must!
