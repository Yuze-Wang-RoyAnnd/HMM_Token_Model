this film, won't win any awards for greatness. but if you have an hour and a half free and fancy a bit of light hearted entertainment then you could do much worse than watch this...<br /><br />the cast are mostly young and pretty, the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. rupert penry-jones as jake seems to have the most fun, while laura fraser as justine is sweet, likable and funny.<br /><br />i rented it because i like the series 'spooks' that rpj is currently starring in. and here he's young and buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls night in.<br /><br />get some wine and some ice cream and have a chuckle.
