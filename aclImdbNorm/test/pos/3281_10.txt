trey's favourite from the first run of season 10 and also one of my personal favourites, manbearpig features the adventure of al gore before going on global warming and before the movie, it was similar a adventure certainly, al gore was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig, al gore had only one thing in mind: to aware everyone of manbearpig and to kill it! al gore here is more than hilarious, everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish, doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f****** demented bastard. basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of al gore but certainly he don't have that in his mind, there's not space for any other subject, is just manbearpig what concerns al gore. those four kids are cartman, kenny, kyle and stan, basically stan felt sorry for al gore and the four boys were just playing in al gore's game never imaging that gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill manbearpig (hilarious scene- "they are just children, damned manbearpig"). so at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for al gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious cartman episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of cartman after he finds a treasure inside the cave, certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick cartman in both senses, he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. and in the end al gore does killed manbearpig! this character is a fantastic one and i'm cereal! terrific fun in this episode, a highly re-watchable one. 10 out of 10
