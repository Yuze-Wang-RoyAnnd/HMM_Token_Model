i got this as part of a competition prize. i watched it, not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production. i laughed myself sick!there are obvious references to other films in the horror genre - texas chain saw massacre, friday 13th etc. all the standard clich'es were there - long drive through partially arid and somehow menacing countryside, inbred red-necks, mysterious vehicles tracking you - throw in some really good humorous scenes (siphoning petrol from the camper-van) and dialogue ("f*****g virgin? that's got to be an oxymoron.." and you have one of the best spoof horror films for years. i particularly liked the way our reluctant hero used his stress-related nose-bleed to great advantage..
