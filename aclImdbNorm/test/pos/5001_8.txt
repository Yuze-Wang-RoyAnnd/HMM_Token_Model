i originally saw this film while i was working as a musician doing musical theatre in summer stock. if you've ever done any work in theatre - especially at a summer stock theatre - you'll really enjoy this film.<br /><br />yes, there are some moments of really bad writing in the film, but overall it's a lovely tribute to the theatre and why people love it.
