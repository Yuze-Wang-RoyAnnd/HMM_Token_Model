mishima - a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul schrader film to this day. mesmorizing cinematography, accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture. as any gifted character, mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts, the main of them being the conflict between the "pen and a sword" as the director puts it in his final chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings, living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of mishima himself.<br /><br />all schrader's films (and the ones he wrote scripts for) are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in. that also goes for mishima, who, apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words. his demise consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play. film like this comes along once in a long while, and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 out of 10!!
