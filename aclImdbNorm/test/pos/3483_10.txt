michael (played by steven robertson) has cerebal palsy, and lives a quiet, and dull, life in carrigmore residential home. when a newcomer to the home, rory (mcavoy), befriends him, he proceeds to show michael how to live past the disability. despite, or maybe because of, rory's crippling disability (unable to move all but his head and a few digits on his hand), rory is fiercely independent, and extremely rebellious. his affect upon the quiet and reserve michael is spectacular, and the two soon leave the care home to set up lives in the outside world, where they recruit the help of siobhan (romola garai) as a care assistant.<br /><br />this film is one of the gems of the year! much like last year's in america, the film goes from being extremely funny, to distressing, touching, upsetting, and truly moving without once seeming saccharine sweet. knowing exactly where to tug at the heartstrings, and where to simply let the story, and characters, do their thing, o'donnell has crafted a wonderful film which tells us all to look past the surface, and see what lies within.<br /><br />the true strengths of the film come in the lead actors. so convincing are their characters that you truly do believe that they are disabled. to further manage to convey humor and sorrow on top of the already great performances is amazing. the pair really seem close friends, and as their tale unfolds you care completely for them.<br /><br />this is definitely one of the finest examples of film this year, telling a very relevant story in a simple way. if this film fails to touch your heart, then you must contain pure ice inside.
