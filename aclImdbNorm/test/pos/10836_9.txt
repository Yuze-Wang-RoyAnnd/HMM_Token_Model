this was recommended to me by a friend that said it was cute and cuddly for a "lesbian sexuality flick". boy was he wrong. i guess he just didn't get it. growing up not understanding and then discovering yourself thru trial and tribulation is more like it.<br /><br />the characters are full and vibrant and the story has enough fun thrown in thru the theater performances to keep anyone interested.<br /><br />rachael stirling as "nan" goes thru so many tries at finding the love she desires only to find it was the one person she was scared to reveal all too, and ran out on. johdi may as "flo" was remarkable. spent a couple hours trying to recall where i've seen her before, only to discover she was the quiet sister "alice" in "last of the mohicans" luckily,i was raised in a liberal family and had no issues with trying a movie like this. so many people are missing out on flicks like this. i'm glad i took my friend's advise and tried it. but, i'm sure i enjoyed it more the he.
