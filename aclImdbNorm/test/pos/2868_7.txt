this is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while. an eerie abandon house, interesting characters, gore and a twisted plot. who could ask for anything more in a horror movie? it is pretty predictable for the most part but then again most horrors you can figure out within the first 10 minutes so i won't hold that against it. the music, camera angles and so forth are excellent. the sets are well make and very convincing. there was pretty much no subplots however, it being a horror movie too many alternate plots only take away from what were wanting from a horror anyhow... to be scared... this one keeps it pretty simple and does just that. if i were to compare it to any other movie i would say it reminded me of the remake of texas chainsaw massacre. definitely a horror movie lover must see.
