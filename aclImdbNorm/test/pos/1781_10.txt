dekalog five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because of the question kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience. three men are the focus of this chapter, and kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad (in one's case, almost overwhelmingly bad). with such vile characters, i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment. however, when the time comes for the murder (and it's subsequent effect on the murderer), kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view, "are you not as guilty as this man?" this sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of dekalog five that much more profound as kieslowski (as usual) doesn't stay within the literal confines of his theme. just as the other parts of the dekalog don't take their commandment's theme in it's literal sense, neither does dekalog five. it asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? it's a fantastic film and, typical of kieslowski, absolutely stunning.
