'checking out' is an extraordinary film that towers above most film production. its refreshing, witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial. to the contrary, the film explores multifarious facets of the human spirit and human relations. its warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of that which unites all people. the characters are charming and amusing, reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh about in ourselves. the quick dialog and witty banter will keep you on your toes, and you may find yourself trying to contain your own laughter, as you won't want to miss a single phrase! you'll probably want to see it in the cinema and then again (over several more times) on video, and each time you will discover something new. after each viewing, you are sure to feel warm and uplifted.
