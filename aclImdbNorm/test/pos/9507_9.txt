they were alternative before there was alternative, the residents are a band like no other, and i love them for it. this has all their classics, from 'hello skinny', 'third reich and roll' to their homage to the great james brown with a take on 'this is a man's man's man's world'. but that is just the beginning. as a bonus it even has renaldo & the loafs hauntingly beautiful 'songs for swinging larvae' and even features the residents cover of it. needless to say, i highly recommend the purchase of this dvd, i would also recommend buying their latest album 'demons dance alone', it is fantastic.<br /><br />uncle willie eyeball buddy #502
