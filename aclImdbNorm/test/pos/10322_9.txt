the stooges are back and funnier than ever. "brideless groom" in my opinion was probably the best shemp flick.<br /><br />shemp has the opportunity to inherit $500,000(which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today) from his dead uncle. but! there is a catch. he has to marry someone that day by 6 o'clock. shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers, except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his. but he doesn't want her, he wants someone a little more on the victoria's secret model type of women. but obviously he has no choice since he's no collin ferrel himself. but when it is printed in the papers that he is to inherit all that money if married, his ex girlfriends are on the "i want my man back" attack! <br /><br />what a great stooge flick! this is up there with thewinners of all stooge flicks! <br /><br />9/10
