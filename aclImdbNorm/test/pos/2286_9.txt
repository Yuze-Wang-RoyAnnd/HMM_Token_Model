*minor spoilers* i just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films, this is definitely in my top three. only little big league and major league can compete with this one in my mind. i would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! without being too specific, i would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. tom selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. his animosity towards playing overseas in japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the dragons. he must adjust to life in japan ("first you wash, then you bathe!") he eventually sees eye to eye with his coach and sets his goals to have that one final season of greatness, though in a much different environment than he ever imagined! so for any baseball fan, or anybody that wants to watch a good baseball movie, mr. baseball will not let you down!
