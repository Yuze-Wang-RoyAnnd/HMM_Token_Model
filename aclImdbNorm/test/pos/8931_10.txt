well, my dad drove lee evans back and forth the hotels so i got to see some being made. its a brilliant film! bob pugh walked past a shed with a lawnmower and he accidentally let go and it went into a fence and he fell over.<br /><br />lee evans was also funny as he seen me and said are you cold i said yes and he said well whack your hands in your pockets! i think it was really funny and it will be a well-known comedy. as like every other lee evans film! they were really great people. they seemed to be quite polite and funny. i would like to meet them again one day. brenda blethyn walked out of her caravan with blood down her and twigs in her messy hair and i got really scared as i didn't notice her until she was right behind me
