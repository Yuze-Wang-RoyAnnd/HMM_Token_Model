despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film isn't too sticky and pink, because love is as a rose: with thorns, that is. the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth. <br /><br />the music and lyrics of the cabaret/chanson-esquire songs (sung b keira knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film, from one place to another, between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love. some people may find it too much a biopic, but it 'is mostly a romantic story, even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy. <br /><br />london gets visualized from another angle for once, the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. the independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. <br /><br />maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film, but all in all this is a great romantic story.
