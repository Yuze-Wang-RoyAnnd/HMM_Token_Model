jarl and moodysson are part of an dying breed of political film makers. the swedish population should appreciate that they try to uncover the truth when the government and media actively distorts and cover up the events surrounding the eu meeting in gothenburg. it is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent kids have been abused and drugged by the swedish police and convicted to prison in political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for others actions. the only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the broad masses in sweden as it will only be shown it theaters and not be released on video or aired on television.<br /><br />the political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insight into complex issues and has a role to play as an educator of the masses.
