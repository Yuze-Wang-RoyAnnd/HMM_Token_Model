i like the wind and the lion very much. it was a good movie. i thought that since i'm young and it was made so long ago i wouldn't like it all that good, but after i saw it, i was amazed of how good it was. my family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone i showed it to liked it. i liked it because it showed how arabs and people in morroco was treated during the early 1900's, by the germans, french, and even the americans. if i was a high school history teacher, i would definitely show it to my student's, from a high schooler's point of view. i give this movie a good 10 out of 10. my grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves. my little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it.<br /><br />systemoffell
