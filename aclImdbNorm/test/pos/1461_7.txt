this is a very strange series with dean learner. i really didn't understand the guests. i knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because...i guess i'm just that stupid. i don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe. i love the serious look that he's got going on. its like that programme that was on on a sunday morning that i forget the name of lol. i also really like the suit and moustache thing he has got going on. its quite hot. he's insensitive which is one of the funniest qualities. i also like the way he has subsections of the programme. it makes it seem more authentic.
