if you're into alternate realities, contemplating what's real and what's just a fantasy, this is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that'll keep you guessing and really make you think. try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! i watched it at an l.a. film festival recently and it was by far the best one in the group that i saw. it helped that it was actually about something, unlike the others that were screened. it's very well directed and the production value is top notch. i would compare it to jacob's ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we're in. you should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it's screening at any festivals near you, try to check it out.
