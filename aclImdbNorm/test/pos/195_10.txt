unlike the many who have posted here, i'm not movie literate. i stumbled across this movie by accident (channel surfing), and couldn't surf away. this is a truly incredible movie, worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it. the actors are terrific. tatiana is beautiful and innocent. her fianc'e boris is sweet and patriotic. you couldn't help but feel boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.<br /><br />others have summarized the movie so well, so i'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most. when boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and "has to marry" tatiana, tatiana's twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape). you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother, or worse, show tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence. since this isn't "french existential cinema", the latter doesn't happen. thankfully! <br /><br />another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris' father of the death of his son. he unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana. i can't describe the sorrow of this scene... still,tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home. the musician actually never saw boris buried, after all.<br /><br />i won't mention more scenes, but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be. no doubt he gets at least a "tenner" at the conclusion of the film! the ending, when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead, still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. you don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw this movie.<br /><br />incredible. go see it.
