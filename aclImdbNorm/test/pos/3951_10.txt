it reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. a brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. the landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. the stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. the drama is compelling. james franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances. naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief -- all converge with unexpected twists. together they create an explosive portrait of fractured love -- one that unwittingly conspires to mend amidst the hardest forms of adversity and illusion -- the blindness of human emotion.
