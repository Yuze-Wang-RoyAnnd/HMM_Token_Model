mankind's self awakening is the theme of "2001: a space odyssey", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. we "see" our primordial past, and we "infer" a cosmic future. the powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.<br /><br />from this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. it's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. for perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.<br /><br />in this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. circles and arcs represent nature. right angles represent conscious intelligence. some people think the sleek, black monolith is a von neumann probe. maybe. without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. mystery is more profound than explanation.<br /><br />"2001 ... " is unique among films in content and scope. the cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. i rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. but stanley kubrick's "2001: a space odyssey" is art in the highest sense, like leonardo da vinci's "mona lisa", or vincent van gogh's "the starry night".
