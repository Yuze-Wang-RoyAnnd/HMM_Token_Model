one hilarious thing i'll say off the top, is i'm not the biggest seisun suzuki fan. i've actually seen a fair number of his works (thanks to a retrospective the film festival had) and i found his films just a wee too yakuza-driven for my tastes. so, i went into princess raccoon wary of what i was going to see. boy! was i knocked out! 'raccoon' is suzuki's attempt at a musical, using the elements of japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements (both audial and visual), raccoon is a treat from start to finish. the lead actor, joe ogdari, proves that he's one of the hottest actors in japan these days in this role. i have to admire that the younger japanese actors still take roles that take place in feudal-times japan, dressing up in samurai gear to full effect. the story itself does get a bit confusing, if you don't follow it really closely, but even if you don't, prepare yourself for the treasures that princess raccoon has.
