begotten is black and white distorted images. it looks like it could have come from the nineteenth century. however, the sound is crystal clear, minus the sync and the addition of calm nature sounds.<br /><br />this movie was very critical of the struggles of life. it shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent. the mother is very oblivious to her surroundings. this leads to lots of torture, pain, and death. you may watch it many times and see different symbolisms, plot devices, and basically "what does it mean?".<br /><br />if you appreciate art in movies then you will love it. otherwise, don't bother.
