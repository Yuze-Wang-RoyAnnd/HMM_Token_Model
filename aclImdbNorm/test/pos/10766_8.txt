i thought this was a very good movie. someone said it was 'sick' so they couldn't watch it. i think if you realize its rated r then you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use. it is a good story and the acting is amazing. just can't be a prude to appreciate it! its basically about a mom who does drugs and wants to get clean so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he moves them to his estate and crazy things happen. i guess it is a drama. i am just so sick of people who don't like movies because of cursing or nudity. that is the world we live in. you obviously aren't comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie. and it's rated r. so, that should tell you from the beginning that its not all peachy happy rainbows. i liked it. i think you will too!
