i opted to watch this film for one reason and one reason alone...samuel l. jackson. i happen to like him, a lot. i had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film, so went into it with no real expectations.<br /><br />jackson didn't disappoint as lazarus, a down-on-his-luck blues man in the deep south, and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes. but the real surprise here was christina ricci, at best a vapid airhead in real life, who took the role of the sexually-abused town tramp rae and made her a believable, almost even likable character. watching the decidedly non-sexual relationship evolve between lazarus and rae was simply amazing.<br /><br />justin timberlake, pop star turned wanna-be actor, should go back to causing "wardrobe malfunctions" and prancing around a pop stage. his mostly forced performance was distracting, at best, from the real story here.<br /><br />this movie is raw, gritty, and at times quite "in your face". not everyone will like it. those that do, however, will be quickly moving it to the top of their favorites list.
