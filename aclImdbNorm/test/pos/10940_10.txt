the twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in cantonese with english subtitles. it is a jackie chan production and he does make a special guest appearance, although it is not for those that liked shanghai noon/knights and the other recent hollywood flicks he has become known for, this film is a lot more special than that.<br /><br />it was originally called the vampire effect but as a very popular chinese female pop duo called the twins (charlene choi and gillian chung) took the two leading roles the title was changed to cash in on their fame.<br /><br />the film will appeal to three types of audience: those who love martial arts films, those who love vampire films and those who loath the rubbish films hollywood generally churns out.<br /><br />the premise for the film is that vampires are about and a secret society seeks to hunt them down before we all become snacks for the undead. this bloody work is carried out by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need, well it must be thirsty work! things are going pretty much for the course until a particularly nasty european vamp finds out that he if he obtains a set of keys held by all the vampire princes then he can walk around in sunlight etc and generally eat when ever he wants to. to say anymore on the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching the film.<br /><br />the twins consist of one assigned vampire slayer (chung) and the sister (choi) of another. it is the twins that really make the film; with some of the freshest and funniest acting going. the fight scenes they carry out are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine athleticism and wire work. to add the cherry on the cake the twins are both quite lovely to watch too.<br /><br />the direction is crisp and the script is sharp. there are only 3 things that let this film down: the make-up for the vampires is quite poor, jackie chan seems to be in the film just for the hell of it and adds nothing to its content, and some of the slapstick comedy attempted by the male vampire hunter is quite lame. thankfully the twins save the day bringing an originality to the film normally only found in european films. the best scene for me was one of them (choi) communicating only by screaming, her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comic delight.<br /><br />their are many other touches of originality in this film - i particularly liked the coffin complete with surround sound stereo and tv screen! and it is the films' many original touches and acting that stops this from being a tired old flop and turns it into a must see movie.
