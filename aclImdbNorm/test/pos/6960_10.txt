i highly reccommend this movie. it blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it has to be seen to be believed. the actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance. i loved the story line, the actors, everything. while i do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes, over-all the movie was impeccably done.
