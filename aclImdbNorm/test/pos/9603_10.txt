.... could it be that itv wouldn't want to release this absolute classic because it would show up their current series of mike bassett for what it is? when discussing mike bassett with some work colleagues i mentioned bostock's cup as being a far superior offering and was surprised to find that i seem to be the only person in my entire office that has actually seen it. this can't be right for a film that has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen.<br /><br />let's face it, itv don't have the greatest recent record for producing comedy so you would think that they would jump at the chance of at least repeating something which is genuinely funny. perhaps if it could be combined with a lucrative telephone competition of where we think the coach driver will go next then they might be interested.<br /><br />come on itv, there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original, quality comedy/drama. do the decent thing thing. repeat it then get it out on dvd.
