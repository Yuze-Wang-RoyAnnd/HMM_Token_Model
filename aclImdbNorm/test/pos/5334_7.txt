the first full-length film featuring the aardman characters wallace and gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half-hour show which aired on television.<br /><br />wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens, and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught. of course, as in other wallace and gromit films, things don't quite work out as planned.<br /><br />similarly to a close shave, there's a love interest for wallace, in this case the village lady posh, and a big mean villain with a bullish dog. gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny. and of course peter sallis provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fit.<br /><br />and as in a grand day out, cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along.<br /><br />on the negative side this film is a little on the long side. there are great effects, and some pieces which make you sit up and watch, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature-length.
