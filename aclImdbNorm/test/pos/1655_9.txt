rififi is a great film that is overlooked. it's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. it's an over used story but this one is different from the others. they round up the usual suspects for the job. this film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. the actual heist scene is one of the best i have ever seen. instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. this fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days. of course things get out of hand and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds up in suspense.<br /><br />so if you're looking for a great film noir that not a lot of people talk about this is a great pick up.
