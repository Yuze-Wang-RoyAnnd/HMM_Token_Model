once upon a time, in sweden, there was a poor salvation army sister. at death's door, she requests, "send for david holm!" but, victor sj"ostr"om (as david holm) cannot be located, because he is spending new year's eve in a graveyard, with his drinking buddies. dying sister astrid holm (as edit) wants to see if praying for mr. sj"ostr"om's soul, over the past year, has produced any results; arguably, it has not. in the graveyard, sj"ostr"om tells the story of "the phantom carriage", which he heard from his dead friend tore svennberg (as georges). according to legend, the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people, until being relieved next new year's eve...<br /><br />director sj"ostr"om, whose lead performance is very strong, combines with photographer julius jaenzon to create a visually appealing film. the great "double exposure" effect is used frequently, but never seems overdone; and, it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable (for example, sj"ostr"om's tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door). a selma lagerl"of story probably wasn't one you could, or would want to, tamper with in the 1920s - which may, or may not be, why the ending of this film is a letdown. and, unlike similar spiritual stories, it's difficult to suspend your disbelief, if you think too carefully about what is really happening in "k"orkarlen".<br /><br />******* k"orkarlen (1/1/21) victor sj"ostr"om ~ victor sj"ostr"om, hilda borgstr"om, tore svennberg
