i write this after just seeing the latest episode broadcast in the uk, and to me it must be a tough job to keep up the standard. the last episode shown called "blink" has elements of gothic horror all to do with statues that aren't quite what they seem. the doctor and martha don't appear much, but that doesn't detract from a well crafted episode. the general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes, the two parter with "the family" and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done.<br /><br />it's not just david tennant holding it together, the whole supporting cast week in, week out are helping as well. for those awaiting series 3 abroad, the wait is is well worth it.
