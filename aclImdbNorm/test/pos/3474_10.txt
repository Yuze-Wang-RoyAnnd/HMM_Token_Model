damien o'donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.<br /><br />this is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. tell everyone you know to go see it now- fantastic!<br /><br />the acting is excellent, and dublin plays a starring role. this film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. i can't wait til it comes out on dvd.
