enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. it's all there. typical characters found in corporate america. joan crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. hope lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. their personal lives is the subplot. <br /><br />wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell stephen boyd's hairstylist that "a little dab will do ya!" the amount of brylcream in stephen boyd's hair is distracting at times. his character's relationship with lange's character was never fully developed which i found disappointing. overall the movie is enjoyable. <br /><br />rating: 8/10
