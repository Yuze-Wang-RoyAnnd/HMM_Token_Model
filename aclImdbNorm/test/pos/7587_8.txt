having previously seen this short on vhs tape with the feature summer stock, i just rewatched every sunday on the tcm site. it marked the film debut of 15-year-old deanna durbin and of 14-year-old judy garland outside of her two older sisters. these two teens showcase their musical talents with a solo from deanna of "il bacio", then one from judy of "waltz with a swing" before the two climax with "americana". the slight plot of this 11-minute film concerns the possible unemployment of edna's (durbin's real first name which is the way she's addressed here) grandfather's conducting job at the park because of low attendance. with the two girls' help, you can probably guess what happens from there! contrasts are marked not only with garland's and durbin's musical choice but also with their height, poise, and movement. despite all that, they perform quite well at the end and it's almost surprising that m-g-m chose garland while durbin was already contracted at universal as this short was made but was briefly allowed back in since her feature debut (three smart girls) was in the early preparing stages. judy herself would make her first feature (pigskin parade) at 20th century-fox as m-g-m was deciding what movie she would next star in. that would be broadway melody of 1938 where she would perform the show stopping number, "dear mr. gable (you made me love you)". but back to this short, every sunday provides a warm and wonderful glimpse of two star singers at the beginning of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them...
