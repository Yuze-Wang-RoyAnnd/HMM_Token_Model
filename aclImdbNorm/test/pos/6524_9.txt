fans of apocalyptic movies will savor this well-made low-budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 george pal classic "when worlds collide." a comet is headed for a near-collision with earth, and when his fellow scientists disregard his warnings of doom, eccentric scientist peter crawford (dennis hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly construct an underground sanctuary.<br /><br />the story unfolds through the eyes of muscle-bound gulf-war veteran jake lowe (peter onorati)who inadvertently discovers crawford's hidden sanctuary and then decides that crawford is wrong for keeping his project hidden from the rest of humanity. as the comet approaches, the subject of who should live and who should die makes for interesting drama.<br /><br />while the special effects are not in the same league, i enjoyed the story more than i did spielberg's war of the worlds, because i feel this screenplay is better. some suspension of scientific reality is required, but it's worthwhile for the development of a good story. i highly recommend this film to fans of the genre.
