despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that i felt were not developed enough, i enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. richard gere and diane lane are great in their lead roles. the basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet. both, also, are searching for healing. unexpectedly, they find that they can help heal each other. there were aspects of the film that i wished i'd seen play out more-- where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on, such as the apology to the bereaved widower, and how adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with paul to feeling okay with it soon after. an opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming. but in the end, the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and i share. and there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears. so, i have to say it is well worth viewing.
