aah yes the workout show was a great. not only did many women get in shape, but many teenage boys got a great workout as well. i am not saying that the show was in any way not appropriate for family viewing, but if you check the other works from the shows producer, you will find more adult themes in his works, which are also excellent. many of the viewers looked forward to the show, men and women alike all gained good information and a wonderful release,from the workouts. the girls were perfect, and beautiful, the show is a classic and should do well in syndication. the show should still be on, as there are never enough choices to view when it comes to health and beauty.
