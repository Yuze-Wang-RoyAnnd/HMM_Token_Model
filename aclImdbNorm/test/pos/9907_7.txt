sometimes a movie is so bad it's kind of good. this movie was made in germany and is dubbed in english, so you have to get past that. the acting also was stilted and forced, other than what was done by the real rats, who imo did an excellent job of acting the part. snaps to the rat wrangler. anyway, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors go on strike as a result, thus leaving large piles of trash everywhere. this storyline has been used before, not to mention has happened in real life (too often unfortunately) and the audience is not in for any surprises. but this is fine. we know what's going to happen and when, and sometimes an audience needs a movie where a lot of brain cells are not necessary to follow along. we have our hero, down to the chiseled face and body, the semi-hero(s), and of course our heroine, who happens to be the doctor, but only still in training, though it is she who discovers what really is going on when so many people end up sick and dying, and not just from a rat bite. of course the villain must die (okay, all the villains, meaning the rats), and the ending scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works. this is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not.
