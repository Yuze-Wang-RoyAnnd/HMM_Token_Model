i'm glad cage changed his name from coppolla and got this part on his own. light-hearted, no deep thought needed, but a cute piece about opposites attracting- though her parents are still hippies.... captures the voice of the early 80's- the whine of the valley and the funk of the other side. one can see the beginning of cage's talent.
