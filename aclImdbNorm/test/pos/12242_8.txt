spoiler alert <br /><br />i have never seen comments on a movie, that i disagree with more then the comments people made on this. one could learn from critical viewings of this movie. as an educational film, i rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! we do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. as entertainment, i rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. this conflict results in my eight star rating. the movie follows jane craig (holly hunter), a television news producer. the network executive introduces tom grunnick (william hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. tom immediately charms people with humbleness. another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, aaron altman (albert brooks). altman knows all news stories, inside and out.<br /><br />the network executive wants grunnick on the air and jane argues, saying grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. they do not listen to her. forced to place grunnick on the air, jane contacts altman to get information on the news story and relays altman's comments through an earpiece to grunnick while grunnick speaks. we watch the sharp contrast between altman's/jane craig's words and grunnick's, as grunnick skillfully rewords everything altman and jane craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from grunnick, the new guy. this new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? this is something altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly. <br /><br />grunnick coaches altman and gets excited noting hundreds of altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. the complexity of understanding what grunnick taught him, causes altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("flop sweat") when he is on the air. grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and altman resigns prior to being fired. but grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with jane craig, because she finds out from altman, that grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. this turns her off of him. this sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them. <br /><br />this movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in broadcast news. there are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of tv news and how grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. the opposite is true, grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (he coaches altman to punch a word in every sentence). grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with jane craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. many people are calling altman very intelligent or brilliant. altman played by brookes is not as intelligent as grunnick and the "flop sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that grunnick handles when on the air. altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. there are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the tv news industry. the concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. as an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.
