"radio flyer" is one of my most loved american movies.<br /><br />the really great job of two boys, joe mazzello and elija wood, (in spite of terrible performance of t.hanks at the beginning and ending...) with marvellous script of d.m.evans and powerful and emotional directing of r.donner plus absolutely incredibly peerless music score of h.zimmer allowed the "radio flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's rating of movies.<br /><br />it's so pity that that very good movie was underrating by some movie critics.<br /><br />i just can't help waiting to see it on dvd.
