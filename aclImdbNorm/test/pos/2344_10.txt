i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. is that not what films are supposed to be about!? but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to. for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive, a lot can be learned from watching this film, technically it has everything going for it, the use of light, music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise. the actors performances are believable to a point, if not slightly under played, i felt there was much more in there, more depth, in particular from the male lead john paul clarke. but one thing that really does bother me, as a film maker myself, is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour? do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? or is this the future of wonderful, affordable film making?
