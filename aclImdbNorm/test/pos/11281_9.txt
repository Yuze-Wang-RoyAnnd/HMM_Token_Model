god cuts himself with a straight razor, afterwards, he gives birth to mother earth, which then gives birth through gods semen, son of earth. <br /><br />this is a one and a half-an-hour movie that sort of depicts a dark version of how god created the world. its surreal, dark and poetic. the most important aspect of the film to me is the visuals. its shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow-motion and normal shooting. sometimes even fast film and stop-motion. the scenes are long and dragged out, that sets a very weird mood. no sounds were recorded when filming (i think), sound effects were added afterwards, such as criccets, water and other ambient sounds, repeated over and over. as you might understand this movie is certainly not for the impatient person...<br /><br />i often felt it was similar to david lynch's eraserhead, only this one is even harder to understand, and even more dragged out, but that's okay for me, i like that kind of stuff. its certainly not entertainment (at least not the hollywood kind) so if your going to check it out, i recommend you set yourself up for it. be open minded, and except something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.
