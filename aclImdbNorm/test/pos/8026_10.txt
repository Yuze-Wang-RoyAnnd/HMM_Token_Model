this is the classic case of an excellent film being looked over by the american public simply due to the fact it didn't have bruce willis or arnold schwarzenneger as the lead man - adrian quinn does a better dual performance, thats right you heard it dual performance in this film than either of those have ever pulled off in their careers! well anyway, now to the review...<br /><br /> the assignment is loosely based upon the story of carlos the jackal, a 1970's radical who terrorized europe for years before finally being apprehended by french agents. in this adaptation, a us naval officer (adrian quinn) is on leave in israel when he is apprehended by mossad (isreal's crack intelligence / counter-terrorism agency) and took in for questioning due to the fact he looks exactly like the jackal (this is the one extremely cheesey part of the film, but trust me it doesn't detract from the great value of this film). when it is discovered mr. ramirez is not the jackal, however, he is recruited by a hardened cia agent by the name of jack shaw (donald sutherland, who does his usual grizzled mysterious government authority figure routine but in a stupendous manner) who has spent his life hunting the jackal, and the series of events which follow will captivate anyone who watches this film - it is chock full of great acting, without all the usual action film cliches and one-liners, and a great plot which will surprise anyone. the three leading men - quinn, sutherland and kingsley - carry this film much further than its modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes. also kudos to the director and his staff, the camera angles and cinematography are top notch, especially in the action scenes. the assignment is better than anyone renting it could ever expect, its a pity the film did fairly poorly in the box office, otherwise we might see a sequel to this stupendous espionage thriller.<br /><br /> 9/10 stars, this reviewer highly recommends it to all potential viewers!
