peter is top notch, he is acting, and looking great. feels like watching a live play, great camera works, and i was sad it was over. can not wait until it is on the big screen. super cast, this could be a big hit. i like the way the kids interact as sister and two brothers, really made me think of my own brothers going through a situation like what peter, the happy father who thinks he will end his life after a big party... the colors and sets were delightful to the eyes, helps so much to draw you into the film/play... i was so happy to see peter not be colombo, this guy could always act, and now this is a movie that gives him that range. i recommend you take your family to this movie. perhaps the teenagers will not get much from this, no guns, fast cars, dumb lines, stupid fart jokes... but your adult kids will love it. good show for a night with them. <br /><br />jason
