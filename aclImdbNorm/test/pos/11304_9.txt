i would have to say that in general barbie movies have impressed me. i have a 5 year old barbie fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say i have seen quite a lot of barbie these holidays, but i am not sick of them.<br /><br />this film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. one thing i noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of barbie's hair in this film. it has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and i think that this is great, as it exposes a new generation to the classics. this film is well worth ago, especially if you have young relievers. they will be entertained for hours!
