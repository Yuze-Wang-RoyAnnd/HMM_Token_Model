i was lucky enough to see this at this years tribeca film festival. i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was. director griffin dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly. the main story involves the family and it is very thought-provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene. the film as a whole has credibility and integrity, yet still has that commercial edge - an "indie" movie for the masses if you like. the performances by the cast are all excellent but it is diane lane who shines the brightest. diane lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be oscar nominated. early days i know, but lane acts her socks off here.
