good (not great) little horror film with a high "creep" factor (not to be confused with a 1991 movie by the same name, or the more recent (2001) campfire stories). central tale of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a campfire in spooky woods nicely leads into, and ties together the different stories that make up the bulk of the movie (watch for ron livingston (office space, band of brothers) and jennifer macdonald in a spirited, sexy segment ("the honeymoon")). solid acting and a few truly "scary" moments make this an above-average chiller. good example of interesting story line, coupled with quality ensemble acting resulting in a whole greater than the sum of its parts. "surprise" ending of the main story adds nice creepy twist, although some may see it coming. movie is not available on dvd, but can be found on vhs.
