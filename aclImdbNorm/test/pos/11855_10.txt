intense, funny, witty, and more than anything, social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results-be it good or bad. mohr and nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date, when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces nicholson to re-think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience. this leads to a disaster of events following mohr, nicholson, and their cohorts. very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy, condescending comedy, while containing your usual variety of comedic, sexual, and frustrated characters(especially charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend...very annoying) who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary.<br /><br />the film goes the way films should go these days, showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals. most of the male characters are the moralistic, straight forward eyes, while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect, however it is easy to assume that most males who do see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending. still, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it's male leads, particularly those of mohr, richter, and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man!<br /><br />the females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to... with someone else. they have amicable traits though, even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. very funny stuff.<br /><br />on another level, the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work. richter meets up with a stressed divorc'ee(a very remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable helen slater) named penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father. as the two go deeper into a relationship, human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied. <br /><br />by the end of the film, mohr and nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next, and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next. it becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time.<br /><br />wallodorski's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened...with the right ending.<br /><br />all in all, this film should have been released nationwide, and i should hope that it is up for some academy awards...maybe helen slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. anywho, this film is a no hits miss, give it all you got romantic sex farce, displayed very maturely and aesthetically.<br /><br />great film!
