i don't see that much wrong with this movie. granted, the principal singers might not be luciano pavarotti and maria callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. burt bacharach and hal david are talented songwriters and i happen to love their songs, especially "the world is a circle", "the things that i will not miss", and "question me an answer". some people claim that hermes pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; i disagree on both counts. i've seen powdered snow before and the snow in those mountain scenes looked realistic to me. and most of all, in this film's defense, it is appropriate for a family audience (at least i remember it being that way when i saw it on christmas day a few years ago.) with all the outcry over sex and violence in the cinema these days, i find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its g-rating. and they don't say that naughty "f" word every ten minutes like some films i've seen. thank god. so although this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, it does have some redeeming value and i give it ten points out of a possible ten. that's my story and i'm sticking to it.
