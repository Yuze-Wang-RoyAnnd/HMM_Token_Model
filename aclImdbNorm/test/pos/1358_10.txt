finally! other people who have actually seen this show! it is the funniest anime i have ever seen, but most people have even heard about it. it is just hilarious. 'and so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day, he will save the world....or maybe not'. tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city...because he has no choice since his brakes are broken (study study study)' and some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook, 'today i had a very educational experience. i tried to look backwards, but unfortunately i was already looking that way. it hurt. todays lesson, the human head cannot turn 360 degrees.'
