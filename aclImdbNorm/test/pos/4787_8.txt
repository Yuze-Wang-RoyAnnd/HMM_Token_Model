i happened to catch this on community tv a few years back and was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable a film it was.<br /><br />while a bit corny in certain ways, as its prime function of being a mystery thriller it works superbly, thanks to a script that concocts an ingenious plot; it kept me guessing throughout and the resolution is inspired.<br /><br />the cast is a star-studded one, containing a mixture of those at the end of their careers (indeed richard long died the same year this was made), or those who were on the verge of stardom in hit tv series (kate jackson, tom bosley). they all do a good job, with the exception of cesare danova who sleepwalks through his role.<br /><br />strongly recommended.
