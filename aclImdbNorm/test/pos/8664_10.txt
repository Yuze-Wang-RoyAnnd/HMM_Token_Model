den brysomme mannen is one of the better films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth and definitely no freedom. a world where people become afraid when someone speaks their mind, expresses himself or show affection, a world where no one is free and no one has any idea what the meaning of any of this is. just like the world we live in, the world in den brysomme mannen is a world of lost souls trying to become fulfilled but focus on the complete opposite of what fulfills them, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions.<br /><br />den brysomme mannen deserves full attention by every human soul, because we could all use a fresh wake up call.
