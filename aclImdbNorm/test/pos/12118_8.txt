i enjoyed this for a couple of reasons. the emotional tangle was at times confusing and imperfectly resolved, but the blend of newsreel footage with the film's narrative was often compelling. the other element that i appreciated was the depiction of the werewolves, the fanatical nazis who continued the fight after the formal surrender. i don't know of another film that deals with them. they assassinated burgomaster oppenhoff of aachen on palm sunday, 1945, for example, and did create problems for the occupation. the film, then, challenges the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities. the "human issues" are presented not so much through the characters here, but through the historical reality that was gripping those who had survived hitler -- both conquered and victors.
