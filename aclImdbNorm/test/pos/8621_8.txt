it is very hard to come up with new information about jfk jr. and this fine movie had very little of it, but it was a joy to watch. the casting was very good and the script, while somewhat like a documentary, was also good. my only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. perhaps a two-part movie could have told us more about his "pre-george" days and his relationships with his mother, sister, and other relatives. some of the material in the book, "american son," by richard blow would have enhanced the movie a lot. wtbs should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie.
