a while back i bought the chinese box set of fist of the north star which came with all of fist of the north star, fist of the north star 2, new fist of the north star, and the fist of the north star movie. while there is an american version and a few european versions, they end half way through fist of the north star which is about as far as the movie goes.<br /><br />the series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called hokuto shin ken (fist of the north star) named kenshiro, or ken for short. there is only one successor each generation. it takes place in a post apocalyptic future where martial arts is the most powerful weapon. the two most powerful arts are hokuto shin ken and nanto divine ken as my version calls it. nanto is really multiple styles but they are all the same since they allow a person to chop someone to pieces. there are six nanto masters and each has their own star. hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage/kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body. each art has their own constellation. hokuto - big dipper, nanto - gemini. kenshiro goes around saving the world from evil consisting of going after his two brothers and three of the nanto masters and their armies. each army captain has their own way of fighting which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. also, kenshiro is looking for his girlfriend yuria who was stolen by the nanto master shin. along the journey kenshiro is joined by his brother toki after rescuing him from his brother rao who calls himself kenou or boxing king. he is also joined by two nanto masters rei, who is looking for his sister who was taken by ken's brother jagi, and shu. both of them and toki die along the way. other characters that join ken are two kids rin and batto who don't do much. that's about as much as i can say for story since its so long and full of details. the series is also divided into four parts.<br /><br />what makes this show great is the fighting. ken normally goes up against a group of people that think they are tough and then get killed in one hit. which is funny and badass, but makes for quick fights. another great part is comedy/badassness. ken hits someone, and they think its nothing. ken says they are already dead. then they die. other parts are when he'll hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live. then a counter will pop up. or when he tells them they are not worthy of knowing his name. then there is when he does a rapid fire kick or punch and goes wa da da da da da da etc. eventually you might find yourself doing it with him. one great part was when a bad guy thought he knew hokuto. he went up to ken and hit him. ken stood there said he was dead in a few seconds. the bad guy counted off then died. it isn't limited to ken everyone else kills just as quick. there has never been a character as awesome as ken and their probably never will.<br /><br />there are a few problems though. one is the repetitive nature. some flashbacks mainly the one with yuria being taken are played too much, and there are also too many recap episodes especially in part four of the series. in fact, the last episode is a recap of the whole thing. another problem is the ending. the final battle with rao wasn't that impressive. ken and rao fought then talked, etc, until rao came to some realization and kills himself instead of ken killing him. but it is better than the american and european versions that just cut off halfway. <br /><br />who would i recommend this for? this is for older teenagers and adults who like action. since the styles cause people to explode or get cut into pieces, the violence is very graphic and there is a lot of it, but they don't show much blood because they usually make the death just a silhouette that still looks like the person but less colorful. this was probably done to avoid censorship. if you don't like action rent the american version. if you like action though, then i say go for the import since you can see all of the series, but they do not have the best english translation since it is subtitled by the chinese. note: my import came with everything i said at the beginning, some imported versions do not, but you still have to get an import to see all of the series and fist of the north star 2. if you don't think you can handle the subtitles for any reason then go get the american version. another note: in the version i got no subtitles were on the last disc for new fist of the north star; although, new fist of the north star isn't very good to begin with.<br /><br />i give the show an 8/10 for its high amount of action, good story, and the awesomeness of kenshiro.<br /><br />****update****<br /><br />toei animation released an english subtitled version. you can download the episodes as well as hokuto no ken 2 from ign's direct2drive or watch it free on funimation's site.
