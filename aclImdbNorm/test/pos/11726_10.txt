dirty harry goes to atlanta is what burt called this fantastic, first-rate detective thriller that borrows some of its plot from the venerable dana andrews movie "laura." not only does burt reynolds star in this superb saga but he also helmed it and he doesn't make a single mistake either staging the action or with his casting of characters. not a bad performance in the movie and reynolds does an outstanding job of directing it. henry silva is truly icy as a hit-man.<br /><br />detective tom sharky (burt reynolds) is on a narcotics case in underground atlanta when everything goes wrong. he winds up chasing a suspect and shooting it out with the gunman on a bus. during the melee, an innocent bystander dies. john woo's "the killer" replicates this scene. anyway, the atlanta police department busts burt down to vice and he takes orders from a new boss, frisco (charles durning of "oh, brother, where art thou?") in the basement. sharky winds up in a real cesspool of crime. sharky and his fellow detectives arch (bernie casey) and papa (brian keith) set up surveillance on a high-priced call girl dominoe (rachel ward of "after dark, my sweet")who has a luxurious apartment that she shares with another girl.<br /><br />dominoe is seeing a local politician hotchkins (earl holliman of "police woman") on the side who is campaigning for governor but the chief villain, victor (vittorio gassman of "the dirty game") wants him to end the affair. hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate victor, so victor has cocaine snorting billy score (henry silva of "wipeout")terminate dominoe. billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in the door of dominoe's apartment and kills her.<br /><br />sharky has done the unthinkable. during the surveillance, he has grown fond of dominoe to the point that he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her. sharky's mission in life now is to bust victor, but he learns that victor has an informant inside the atlanta police department. the plot really heats up when sharky discovers later that billy shot the wrong girl and that dominoe is still alive! sharky takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated. he assembles his "machine" of the title to deal with victor and his hoods.<br /><br />william fraker's widescreen lensing of the action is immaculate. unfortunately, this vastly underrated classic is available only as a full-frame film. fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture, especially during the mutilation scene on the boat when the villain's cut off one of sharky's fingers. this is a rather gruesome scene.<br /><br />burt never made a movie that surpassed "sharky's machine."
