i thought this was movie was great, richard greico and yasmine bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. yasmine bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with richard greico's character. they end up getting married and everything seems perfect except yasmine bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. richard greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. i thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing. it shows how naive one can be when they have fallen in love. yasmine bleeth is a good actress in this, and i wonder why she never made it further in her career. richard greico is very impressive as the deceiving husband, and plays the evil part very well. i wonder why certain actors make it and certain ones don't. all and all a great movie that i would recommend.
