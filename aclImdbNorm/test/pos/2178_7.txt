this film certainly wasn't very sophisticated. no, the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that i think about it. but, also while i think of it, i did laugh--proving decent comedy doesn't need to be very deep.<br /><br />fatty arbuckle is the definite star of this short, despite buster keaton's appearing in the film as well. he is the butcher in an old-time grocery store. a lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and i think i laughed the most at the coffee grinder sequence--you'll just have to see it yourself.<br /><br />anyway, later, fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because he can't stand to part, he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school. arbuckle is one ugly woman! so, for silly and unsophisticated fun, see this film. it won't change your life and is a very slight picture, but it's also fun.
