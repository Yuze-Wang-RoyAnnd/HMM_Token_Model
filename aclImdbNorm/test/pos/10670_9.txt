this movie has been a favorite of mine and is entwined with the christmas holidays for me for two reasons: (1) growing up in the 1960s, everything was space-related from advertising to television programs and even santa claus found himself in spaceships during that era; and (2) i saw this movie during a christmas shopping trip when i was ten years old and it brought back fond memories of my favorite tv shows when i was even younger ("supercar", fireball xl5", and "stingray",). therefore, i am a tad biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons.<br /><br />that said, as a long-time student of film, this is mainly a movie for fans of gerry anderson (and barry gray; oh, that gorgeous score!) whereas the casual movie-watcher will be put off by the future-vision-from-the-past (dig those wild cars, commercial aircraft, clothes, etc.) and the so-called "plot twist" which will cause some to groan. however, if you can look past the post-"2001: a space odyssey" desire to make a science fiction film with a "far out" story line, and if you enjoy imaginative special effects, then you will enjoy this gem from an era when man had just walked on the moon and people were still looking up at the stars in wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal trappings of the actual 21st century.
