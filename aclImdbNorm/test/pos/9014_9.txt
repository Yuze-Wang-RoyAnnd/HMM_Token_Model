while i understood, that this show is too weird to please everybody, i don't get where all these bad reviews come from, and i'm most surprised over the bad reviews, that it has gotten from fans of the movies. i liked it and got hooked on it since the first episode i watched. it's a little messed up though, that kuzco was put into school. and it seems to be high school rather than college. but i guess he's only eighteen, right, so it's not like he's too old to get educated? and haven't the royals always had to get the best education avaible to them? so the "kuzco has to graduate, or he won't become emperor" thing doesn't sound too weird for me. and i guess his education was neglected before, so that's why he has to be educated now.
