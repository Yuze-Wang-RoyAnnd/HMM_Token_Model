accepted...let's see. the only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when shrader(sp?) said, "ask me about my weiner". after that i had to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends...and wow amazing. one of the best films of the year. the entire movie i was laughing like crazy! the plot in this story is that bartleby (justin long) doesn't get accepted into any of the schools he applied, so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he did make it into college. so he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents...until, more students look at the website and see the clicker (acceptance is one click away) and all these rejects come to this school. they face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 10/10 loved it now watch it
