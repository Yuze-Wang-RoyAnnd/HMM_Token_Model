there's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing god's work. yeah right! this killer makes jason voorhes look like a chump, and freddy krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. he is jacob goodnight(wwe's glen "kane" jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a axe, and a hook and chain. those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. that is totally methodical! when the encounter happened 4 years earlier, jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. how on earth did goodnight survive after 4 years? now he's in the condemned hotel called blackwell. and this hotel got a lot of stories to tell. i thought this movie was haunting as well as interesting. i liked the part where goodnight checked out one of the girl's tattoo on her back. and goodnight himself is really deranged thanks to his maniacal mother. if you think friday the 13th was something, you better think again. this movie will leave you on the edge of you seat. and i think the eyeball rip was bone-chilling. this movie proves it point,and it wasn't a waste of my time. i enjoyed it. the title don't lie! rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!
