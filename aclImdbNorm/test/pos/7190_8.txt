i don't know about the english version of this movie, but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie i've seen in many years. the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that i'm amazed they kept having more options, like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly. it becomes things like malcom(i)x and "utenriks", which is norwegian for foreign affairs.<br /><br />like the word "utenriks", many of the translations does not give any meaning in english, and probably not in french either, so the translators must have made up their own jokes, and done so very well. of course, they have a very good base to build on, with a film that's simply comical from beginning to end!<br /><br />recommended in all languages with a good translation!
