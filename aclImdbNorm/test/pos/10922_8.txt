some movies want to make us think, some want to excite us, some want to exhilarate us. but sometimes, a movie wants only to make us laugh, and "in & out" certainly succeeds in this department.<br /><br />indiana high-school teacher howard brackett (kevin kline) is going to be married to fellow teacher emily montgomery (joan cusack) in three days, but the whole town is more excited about the oscar nomination of former resident cameron drake (matt dillon). but when cameron wins an oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher, howard, for inspiration. what follows is howard denying it in an hilarious set of mishaps in a truly screwball fashion.<br /><br />kevin kline is great, exuding gay stereotypes. joan cusack really has a knack for screwball antics. debbie reynolds is utterly hilarious as howard's mother. and bob newhart is also a hoot as the homophobic principal.<br /><br />gay screenwriter paul rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. he knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that's mostly tolerable to conservative midwesterners and yet mostly inoffensive to the gay audience. it's not exactly progressive, but it's funny and inoffensive, and definitely a step up from the previous year's "the birdcage."
