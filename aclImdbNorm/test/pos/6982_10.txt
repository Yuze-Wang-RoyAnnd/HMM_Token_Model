(very mildly spoilerish)<br /><br />i must start by saying that i'm not usually impressed by science-fiction, so pitch black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. it had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my seat. i'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least *one* of the best) science fiction piece that i've seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />the plot in short might sound simple -- a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain, caroline fry (impressive radha mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. at first, a cold-blooded murderer, riddick (vin diesel, who plays the role with very believable spare style), might seem like the group's biggest problem but as the dusk starts crawling in, the creatures of the night start awakening... this leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic.<br /><br />it's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching -- after all, let's face it, if you strip it down to the basics it's not *that* original -- but the skill in which it's told. the story flowed forward, didn't leave me yawning (at least not much) in any point. the directing was fabulous work. this was a very visual, even beautiful movie; the purple night view was a real treat. although, 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use; yes, the images shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface. (not to mention that the monsters were really well done, they looked realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real...])<br /><br />i did not only enjoy the visual side of the movie but also the psychological aspect of the story. during the movie we get to see the characters unraveling -- some of them fall, some of them rise -- but what fascinated me the most was the developing of the character of riddick. i enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie. to go even further, the other thing i enjoyed a lot with riddick was the incredibly well and originally executed ust (unresolved sexual tension) between fry and him that "didn't" (you'll get what i mean once you see it). [one can't deny that they had chemistry. don't even try or i'll seek you out and make you listen to me playing chopsticks until you scream *grin*] it was fresh. as radha mitchell once put it (a modified quote), "pitch black is a really sexy movie with no sex", which is what makes it even more so interesting.<br /><br />so, to summarize, i recommend this movie -- even if you're really not a fan of "space stories". the suspense was kept until the very end and, what's important, we were (or at least i was) left wanting for more. if you can't be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and such (as is my bad habit), you'll still find pitch black highly entertaining. just kick off your shoes and enjoy.
