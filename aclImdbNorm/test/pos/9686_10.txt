....but at the same time part of you is thinking "am i ready for what i am about to see?" <br /><br />in the end, you are happy you saw it. i was, at least. jackass number two has twice the laughs and twice the action. some stunts will leave you breathless. besides little miss sunshine, i think it was the best movie i saw this summer. maybe even this year. <br /><br />the entire cast returns, besides a few such as chris raab and rake yohn. i don't think any of the cast members had a dull moment. each and every stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. the beginning was just as funny as the first one, and the ending was interestingly hilarious; the cast performing a musical number. <br /><br />jackass number two is the perfect movie to see with your friends. stay during the credits, there are some pretty funny moments. one involves luke wilson.
