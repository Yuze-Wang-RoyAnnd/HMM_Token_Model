the greatest compliments to the other commentator here at imdb who asked himself why this series didn't "get stuck" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s did.<br /><br />it is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued.<br /><br />i will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the robin hood legend.<br /><br />first of all, robert addie (gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever.<br /><br />nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. and at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of terry jones' history documentations about egypt, greece, rome, konstantinopel, the goths and barbarians, and the middle ages and crusades (...yes, the monthy python-terry jones):<br /><br />if you have seen those brilliant and funny jones-docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff carpenter, the writer of the robin of sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of john carpenter, who made "the thing", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us.<br /><br />the writer of "dick turpin", "catweazle" and the first two seasons of "robin of sherwood", called "kip" carpenter, is my movie overlord. he's better than all those others who criticize his "sword-and-sorcery" element or "defectiveness" (taken from the robin of sherwood webring) of this series (that i can not see) or have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now.<br /><br />that's why, when you get to know this "robin of sherwood" better, you'll be severe. you will at first loathe the third season. not only that: i did myself go thru this, and on top of it, i have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - despite the fact that praed, the actor of robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous canadian series called "the new adeventures of jules verne" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. praed went for money, and not for fame, he didn't stick with his gang and kin, i mean: as actors.<br /><br />actors who personally represent the afterwards "really", in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the robin-legend. the potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues.<br /><br />again, obligatory to say: a change of the main role was forced by praed's stupid decision of leaving robin of sherwood for a silly remake-series of the verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. still it is in some aspects a catastrophe.<br /><br />anyway: if one is informed about this, and that connery was maybe really advertised by his father, but that the young connery did not at all "chase praed away", how i prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season. sad here is that the script was not anymore written by superman kip carpenter, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in "the witch of elsdon", or in "the king's fool", two episodes of the first series that is a) funny, b) historically educating and c) brilliantly acted. ===<br /><br />"don't trust the lion!"<br /><br />unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own gain of power, richard lionheart, as shown in ros and as in real history, was a greater authority than john or others, but used it only for his wicked idea of the crusade and the war against normandie in france. he slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of christians, muslims and jews in the "wholy" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger or poverty. on top of that, after his capture by the saracens (muslims) in the crusades, britain was squeezed out for his ransom, 100.000 marks (at that time, 11th century, comparable to approx. 30 billion - 30'000'000'000.- dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then he just visited england for a month to return to normandie (in france, where the norman invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode "the king's fool"). for this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for his capture, richard lionheart again "drains the country of money" (cited out of clive mantle's mouth, when he lectures robin in being critical with even the king). robin criticizes this warfare unsocial ruling of richard's, he addresses richard himself, telling him "the poor gave everything to set you free, how can you ask more of them?" - richard: "...give me your courage and strength, not your words!" ...later, in private, richard orders the assassination of robin...<br /><br />so, the crusaders were the real "barbarians".<br /><br />p.s: already when i watched kostner in 91, i got upset, because after-wards, i found out in history course in school that richard was not that good just man as displayed by sean connery in his appearance at the end of "prince of the thieves". well, as terry jones would put it: it is a lie, a treacherous lie!" sean plays humorist and charismatic, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of "robin of sherwood".<br /><br />again: praed is, according to my info up to now, the one who left sherwood for a stupid verne-series nobody with brains will ever remember or want to remember.
