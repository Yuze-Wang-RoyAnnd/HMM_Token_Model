italian soft x exorcist clone.<br /><br />woman buy statue of crucified thief. said thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies.<br /><br />ivan rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. mostly due to his gift of evil looks. and because he was never above doing nudity. good on him.<br /><br />the actress in the lead did a decent job. her wide eyed innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped.<br /><br />this one has a similar plot element to most italian horror films. the girl's parents are filthy rich, and depraved. watch it to get the details.<br /><br />laura gemser's husband, gabriel tinti, also appears as a random stud. his part is basically phoned-in, but like a cheap beer, it did the job.<br /><br />fault the director for its failings. this could have been a horror/sex classic.
