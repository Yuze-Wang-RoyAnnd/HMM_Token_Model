i was 19 years old when i saw first saw this film, in the theater. i have a vivid memory of a different ending. not completely different but significantly. i just watched the movie last night and i was wrong, so i guess the following can't be called a spoiler, since it never happened. the ending i remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, frances austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him, she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera. only his face was in the frame and it was pretty obvious he was letting it happen, albeit against his will. but nothing like this showed up in the movie. sandy dennis was 32 years old when she made this movie, michael burns was 22. in the movie, he complains to his sister that frances makes too big a deal about sex. yeah? well, then, so go to bed with her dude, and get it over with. wtf?
