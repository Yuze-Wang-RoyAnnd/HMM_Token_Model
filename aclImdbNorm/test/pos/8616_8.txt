i like breillat's movies, but this one is the best i've seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence. anne parillaud is electric, and the script is amazing - especially considering it's supposed to take place on the set of another of breillat's movies. you don't have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this. it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. try to imagine a male director with jeanne's openness - not impossible, but a little mind-bending. the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here, but not a cold light.
