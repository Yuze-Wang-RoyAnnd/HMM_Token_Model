i really enjoyed this movie, and i'm not a classical music fan. the story of the tough street kid discovering classical music and changing his ways was great to watch, without being sentimental or too unbelievable, although some details had me scratching my head (frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any of the students or teachers discovering him? where did he eat? bathe? did he ever get a change of clothes? what did he feed his dog? the owner of the school didn't think it was important to notify the police about finding a missing boy, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? :-) ). but we can let such unrealistic details slide and just enjoy the touching, fun, and slightly suspenseful (for me, anyway) story and wonderfully talented children.<br /><br />i loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder on the steps barring the policemen from entering the school: i doubt they would get away with that nowadays. and i liked the nice touch about the boy frankie stole from turning the tables on him (although that never really went anywhere), and frankie's friends helping him out in the end.<br /><br />all in all, a great movie for everyone!
