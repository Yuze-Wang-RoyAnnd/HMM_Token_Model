excellent entry in the rko saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. george sanders is suave and witty. jonathan hale simply is inspector fernack. paul guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. he will return in a later entry in the series. story begins on an ocean liner headed to the u.s. where the saint meets but cannot connect with wendie barrie. she eventually succumbs to the saint's charms but she breaks his heart in the end. the saint assists inspector fernack clear his name from a frame. a few bodies fall along the way. good entertainment and above average for this type of film. watch it.
