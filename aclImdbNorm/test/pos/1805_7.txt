i've seen this movie quite a few times and each time i watch it, the quirkier and funnier it becomes. perhaps its the lack of research that went into nicolas cage's character's 'punk' persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film...nonetheless it's a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters. i think it's right up there with "fast times" and "weird science" (quintessential eighties flicks!)
