hardware wars is a hilarious, 12 minute short film parody of the original star wars movie which was released just a few months after star wars in 1977. this film uses household appliances as space ships and star wars look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. this film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired mel brooks to write his star wars parody movie called "spaceballs".<br /><br />this is my favorite parody film and i recommend it to anyone who is familiar with star wars and has a good sense of humor.<br /><br />
