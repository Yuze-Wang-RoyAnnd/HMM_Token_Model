it has been since 1972 that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies. i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isn't. you would think that anything starring peter sellers would be brought back. much better than "being there" and as good as the pink panther series. uschi digard had a small part for such a well endowed performer. she is bonus in this movie. i think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of urine samples.
