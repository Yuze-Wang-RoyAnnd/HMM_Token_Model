perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself. what i want to point out here is that "distant" is not only an art-house film but one of the best art-house films. from all the art-house films i have seen, "distant" is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold. it is even fair to say that this film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass tarkovsky's nostalgia. one commentator got it right, that sex, a jaded, common feature among foreign films, is surprisingly lacking in "distant" and in a good way. what is most remarkable about "distant" is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world. fortunately "distant" doesn't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings.
