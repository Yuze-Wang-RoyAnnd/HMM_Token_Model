i quote below words from my favor writer, paulo coelho, as the comment for this movie.<br /><br />" when you really want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"<br /><br />it is too easy to forget who we really are and what we desire to do in life. because there are always too many comments and advice surrounding us to tell safety. i had almost forgot what the passion feel like. despite of the adventure will take me out of safety zone, i truely believe the fear is just the price that i need to pay for the coming brand new journey in life.<br /><br />thanks for inspiring me with this lovely story. it is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. that is the most treasurable love from the light of soul.
