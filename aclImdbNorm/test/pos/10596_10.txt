this film had everything i need in a film: - women, skateboarding, violence, music by h.i.m and tony hawk!!! the artwork and camera effects in this film is amazing. the music in this film is the best i've heard in any other film. each track goes so well with its scene. i thought the acting was really good considering none of bams crew have been in scripted films before. although the whole concept of the film is the story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend (glauren) who is sleeping with hellboy behind his back is a predictable and age old story. they way its acted out is very unpredictable, for example: falcone and the gas tank, raab himself, dunn breaking bottles behind the wawa and all the don vito scenes. this films is a must see!
