"empire strikes back" director irvin kershner's "never say never again," a remake of the 1965 james bond movie "thunderball," doesn't surpasses the terence young original, but this non-harry saltzman & albert r. broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. nevertheless, despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score, "never say never again" rates as an above-average, suspenseful doomsday thriller with top-flight performances by a seasoned cast including sean connery, kim basinger, klaus maria brandauer, max von sydow, barbara carrera, edward fox, bernie casey, alec mccowen, and rowan atkinson. the film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes. unlike the franchise james bond sagas with their breath-taking moments of spectacle, "never say never again" provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. indeed, the film features only three gadgets: an explosive ball-point pen, a wristwatch with a laser, and a souped-up motorcycle. aside from the flavorful lani hall opening theme song, "ice station zebra" composer michel legrand's orchestral music score leaves much to be desired. legrand replicates none of those snappy, jazz cues that made john barry's music for the regular bond franchise so memorable. all in all, "never say never again" seems to fit more into the first two bond movies
