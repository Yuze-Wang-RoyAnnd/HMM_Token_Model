this film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from crispin glover and dennis hopper! the reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), i don't really see any weaknesses in this. the opening shot was brilliant.<br /><br />keanu reeves was decent for a change and miss skye was right on the money. hopper had three other great performances that same year (blue velvet, texas chainsaw ii, and hoosiers). i imagine this has a cult following and i wonder how this picture would fare if it was re-released. super stuff!
