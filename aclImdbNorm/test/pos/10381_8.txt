it's just stories, some we wish happen to us, some we wish never happen to us, all about unfulfilled desire. the locations and nude bodies are beautiful, but after the second story all i could think was 'it takes more than just beauty to create a real film'. then of course the film unfolds. the stories are moving except sophie marceau fails to communicate her story in this film. malkovich plays the story for both of them though. the voiceover fails to link the stories but helps malkovich to provoke some thought.<br /><br />i'd say it is worth seeing and the best of antonioni i have seen. given his age - remarkable!
