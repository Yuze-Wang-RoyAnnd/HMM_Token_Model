i've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. when a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. last weekend i found a new one in paul vario playing uncle benny in eddie monroe. this was a slick film highlighted by vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). i also especially liked the actress playing benny's niece and eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it. a nice job all around ... and mr. vario shined brightest. he's gotta be my tony gangi someday ...
