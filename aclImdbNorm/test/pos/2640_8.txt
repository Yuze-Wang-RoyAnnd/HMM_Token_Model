great party movie, following the adventures of bill & tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. bill (eric stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend tom (chris penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. when bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. meanwhile, his friend tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn bill's life upside down. this movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. soundtrack features guitar virtioso edward van halen throughout the movie, also features cameos by rockers lee ving and ron wood. 70s pornstar legend kitten navidad also makes an appearance! classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks. now all that needs to be done is a much anticipated dvd release! if you enjoyed this movie, take a look at "the last american virgin" which is similar to "wild life". i rate both highly.
