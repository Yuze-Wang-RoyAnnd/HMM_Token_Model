i adore the ln chaney version of "phantom" and i appreciate webber's version if only for the growing interest in the book, wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed. i don't approve of the fact that andrew lloyd webber made the relationship between raoul and christine less restrained.<br /><br />luckily since this is a comedic short with only erik and christine this version doesn't even have to bother with any other characters.<br /><br />i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up lon's performance. i was dead wrong. leslie nielson is fabulous as erik though, of course this is a spoof. it's still brilliant.<br /><br />i especially appreciated the fact that erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim. i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that, other than lon's.<br /><br />however, i do not recommend this short if you don't like spoofs. because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously.
