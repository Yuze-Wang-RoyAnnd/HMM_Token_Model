for me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. this could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). john carpenter's "the thing" is one of very few films to fit this criterion.<br /><br />i've been a science fiction fan since i was a child in the sixties, and i read the john w campbell short story on which the film is based ("who goes there") before i saw the original, black-and-white howard hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the tv, when i should have been in bed!). that movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. i watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on tv). because of this, i avoided the carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, i thought, always a mistake. when i did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on tv because there was nothing else on, i realised that i need to change "always a mistake" to "usually a mistake"! carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. from the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), i was hooked. the sound track alone lives with me - all i have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and i'm *in* the final scene again ...<br /><br />until seeing "the thing", i had carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. since seeing "the thing", i think i have seen most of his movies - i haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. he is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.<br /><br />if you haven't seen "the thing", and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!
