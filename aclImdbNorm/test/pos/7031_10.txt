this is an excellent movie i have been watching it since i was 6yrs old with my big sister. it is the type of movie that u can watch over and over again and still laugh, smile, and cry every time with out ever getting bored of it like other movie's. it is a movie that will live on forever through generations of family. i love it :) when ranking from 1-10 in my case i would rate it easily 9.9 every time. <br /><br />itis a film about the change of a girl (baby) and her first boy-friend (johnny)their relationships within the family, the changes in baby's and johnny's view of the world during their relationship.<br /><br />dirty dancing will forever live on as a timless classic. thank-you sorry though for only the short comment.
