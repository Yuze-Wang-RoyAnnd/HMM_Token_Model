went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in london. we didn't know what to expect, the poster gave some of it away, and i won't say any more so as not to spoil the plot, but we found it to be an excellent film with great acting, convincing plot and scary as hell! having done some research on the making of the film i have to hand it to those guys, the filmmakers, actors, writers, etc., for having put together such a film with such limited resources. post-production very well done, too. for all of that i give them a 10 out of 10, and i hope they will continue their fine work. keep it up, guys. you rock!
