over the last few months, i have seen a lot of reviews for the italian job, many of them negative. the gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that, for all its modernistic bravado and high-budget technology, the film doesn't have much substance where it counts. look, people, it's just a fun movie. this is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back, relax, and just enjoy the steady-moving pace of the film. like ocean's eleven (2001), you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking (lucky for some of us). granted, "ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? the plot may have some holes (there's a huge one about 3/4 of the way through), the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be, and some of the dialogue may seem pointless and cheesy, but again, who really cares? cool characters, mini coopers, big explosions, charlize theron. what more do you want? i think it's time to drop the fake roger ebert meets gene shalit act and enjoy yourself for once! oh, and another thing, whatever you do, don't compare it to the original because, to reiterate what f. gary gray has told the press a million times, this is not a remake!! my advice- if you're interested in nit-picking your way through a good-humored, fun flick, don't even bother seeing the italian job. but, if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and/or want to see ed norton get jacked by a bunch of ukranians, go ahead. the bottom line, my fellow moviegoers, is: lighten up and have fun, dammit.
