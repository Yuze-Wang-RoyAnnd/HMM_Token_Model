unfortunately, i've never seen the full version of this movie. i did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. even more floridly directed than is the norm with julien duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. beautifully lit too by photographer andr'e thomas, black jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including agnes moorehead and marcel dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations. george sanders gives a polished performance, whilst an eccentric millionairess (who turns out to be a rival racketeer) is admirably played by agnes moorehead. also realizing the most from her role, patricia roc. the film was made, on locations in spain, in 1949.
