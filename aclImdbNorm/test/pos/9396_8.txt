i'm not sure what i can add that hasn't already been said in some of these other fine, and quite hilarious, comments, but ill try.<br /><br />so you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lays on it with its orange soda-filled body. we have the man, in some scenes looking uncannily like robert smith of the cure, hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings-on, and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed.<br /><br />this is no ordinary bed. no sirree bob! not only does it eat people, but it cleans up after itself, draws the covers back, and it even makes itself. who wouldn't want a bed like that? it can even use its sheets as a rudimentary "lasso" to wrangle escaped victims back in (especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape).<br /><br />our "main" story (if you can call it that), is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house-sit(??). i don't recall exactly, but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. the dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. one of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of "the gang" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voice-over, but we don't care; character development was thrown out the window a long time before in this film so why start now? there are scenes when the bed laughs, snores, crunches, and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast's non-reaction to said noises, cant be heard. this and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats ok....this is death bed: the bed that eats and it defies all logic so its ok. it makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film if you buy (hehe buy...did i say "buy"?) this dvd, make sure to check out the introduction by the director. he explains that the filming of this "flick" started in 1972, didn't wrap up until 1977, he shopped it for a few years with no luck, and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on dvd. supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance, on a message board no less, that our director found evidence that people knew, and gasp! cared, about his little-known film. its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. i'm glad he did. once you've even so much as heard the title to this film, you must see it. i for one am going to buy this and i'm going to preach its gospel around the world...starting with this comment
