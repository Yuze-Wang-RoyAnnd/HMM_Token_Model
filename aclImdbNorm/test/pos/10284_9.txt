an obsessive love story, where the characters have been extremely convincing. i think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. specially for vincent cassel who wouldn't (at the time it was filmed) be the first character you think of for such a role. and yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful monica belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. i can only say, that this film should have been released at it is in the usa, instead of thinking of doing a remake. it is simply so french, almost perverted....and yet so true...this film should stay untouched...<br /><br />a director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop..
