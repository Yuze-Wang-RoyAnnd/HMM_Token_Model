unfortunately this original mix of action and laughs is kept from cinema fans as it sits rotting in the columbia vaults for all eternity. a shame since this may be jack starrett's strongest film and features a witty script by a young terrence malick and fully realized performances by its two leads stacey keach and frederic forrest who turn to a life of crime so they can get the money to open a seafood restaurant. many standout scenes include interrogation by bathtub and electric razor, and an intense shootout in an abandoned building as it's being torn down by a wrecking ball!
