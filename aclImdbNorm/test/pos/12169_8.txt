the trio are a pleasant, nostalgic journey to that first hint of desire--when it was still about simple exploration of the unknown--before we "grew up" and added those complexities of hiv status, emotional baggage and gotta-run-my-pager-just-went-off into the emotional mix.<br /><br />the angst portrayed is pure adolescent angst, but it rings true in all three stories. their sweetness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay. and those kinds of films are few and far between.<br /><br />good news! both boys life and boys life 2 are now readily available on dvd as of september 1999.
