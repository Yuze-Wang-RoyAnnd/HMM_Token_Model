i finally got hold of the excellent sazuma dvd of this film which is loaded with interesting extras. i have read quite a lot about it, and i unfortunately missed it at the stockholm film festival. it doesn't quite deliver as i thought it would but it is still worth watching if you like strange and unique movies. i much rather watch this again than any of the recent so-called horror films vomited out of hollywood these days. what detracts from the experience for me, is certain music cues which sound dated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds. for me, all these tonal/harmonic elements of the score could have been lifted out, and replaced by david kristians excellent sound design. but that is just my opinion. otherwise this is a daring, angry picture with welcome meditative and poetic parts, like the fading of the photograph sequence which is beautiful. i look forward to seeing ascension, and i applaud mitch and karim for their efforts in producing non-mainstream cinema. they are a great inspiration as i soon embark on my own short film production.
