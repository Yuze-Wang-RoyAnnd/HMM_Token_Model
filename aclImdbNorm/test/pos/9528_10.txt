i try to catch this film each time it's shown on tv, which happily is quite often. but i keep forgetting to video it. as it is, i practically know the script by heart, but that doesn't stop me having a good cry, in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what's coming next. it's such a lovely film - well made, well cast, good photography. i love it. one of my top ten films.
