in 1968, stanley kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by arthur c. clark. it was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. his style of movie making is still fresh and intact.<br /><br />i have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and i even have a vhs copy of the movie in my library. cs3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: who is hal and what is he thinking?<br /><br />i enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of hal's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. in the second scene, dr. dave bowman and dr. frank poole are eating their food in front of two tv monitor on their sides and hal's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them. in the tv report, hal was introduced as the new generation of super computer put in work in january 12, 1992 called hal 9000 series. during the interview hal reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully. <br /><br />in another scene, dave is sketching dr. hunter, dr. kambel and dr. kaminsky who they are all in hibernation sleep. hal is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the jupiter mission. his calm and monotone voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. <br /><br />in the next few scenes we will see how hal tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power. his conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination. when dave wants to return to the spaceship and hal does not listen to him, there is the most memorable line of the move: ' i'm sorry dave, i am afraid i can't do that. ' in the middle of the most important interact between human and machine, hal's voice can conjure both solid calm and malevolence in the same monotone. <br /><br />dave has gone back to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts, and determined to disconnect the hal's main brain cells. hal uses his final apologetic techniques to convince dave of not disconnecting him. hal begs him to stop and let him correct himself. these are his famous lines while dave is disconnecting his modules one by one:<br /><br />'dave, what do you think you are doing?<br /><br />dave? i am entitled to the answer of the question!<br /><br />i know everything is not quiet right with me recently
