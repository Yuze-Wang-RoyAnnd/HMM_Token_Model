thank god for the internet movie database!!! when i first got this movie i watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something different out of it every time. but no matter how i sliced it, it came up disturbing. the black and white and all the twitching really freaked me. you stare at the screen unsure of what you are looking at, and just when you think you got it, it becomes clear and it's something completely different. the imagery is very disturbing, twitching and straight razors do not sit well with me in any movie. still everytime i watched it, i was interpreting it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue, ya know), so i decided to check the imdb for the plot summary. boy that throws me for a loop, i had no idea that was supposed to be god. now i'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens....
