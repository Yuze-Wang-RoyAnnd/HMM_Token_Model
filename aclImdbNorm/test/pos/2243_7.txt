beginning where it left off, doctor who, rose, her alternative dad, mickey, his alternative counterpart ricky, and mickey's small gang of rebels find themselves at the mercy of this realities version of the cybermen, this second part of the 2 episode cybermen arc feels more like a doctor who episode, as opposed to the previous part which honestly felt like more of an episode of the defunct show "sliders", which granted was a great show in it's own right. the arc as a whole was enjoyable enough as i'm one to subscribe to the maxim that any who is good who, but at the same time it's inevitable that this will be compared to the dalek episode of the previous series. and said comparisons would only make this seem like a lesser work, as it is. i just feel that this story could've been done in one episode. remember in the first part of the review i said that these type of stories dealing with alternative realities usually have no lasting repercussions, well that's not the case here, but what changes overall feels tagged on and not really in keeping with the character.<br /><br />my grade: c+
