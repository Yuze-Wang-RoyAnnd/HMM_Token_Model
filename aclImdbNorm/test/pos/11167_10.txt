abc's version of the life of the late pope: they put it just slightly ahead of cbs's version and it may have suffered from that but the program itself was excellent. it moved fast since it only had two hours (with commercials also taking up time) to cover this great man's long life, but thomas kretschmann admirably was up to the challenge.he did a remarkable job in conveying the emotions and strife that john-paul endured.he-unlike the cbs biopic- played the role from youth to old age and managed to seem "realistic" at both ends of the scale.his credibility never wavered.he has an amazing range and depth. it is a shame that the program could not have been longer and more detailed but working within the time frame they did have,i think they did an excellent job bringing it to the small screen.
