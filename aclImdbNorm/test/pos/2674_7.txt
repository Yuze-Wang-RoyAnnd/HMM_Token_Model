as far as christian film goes,it's typical.lacking of a mega-budget they try their best.some times falling short,sometimes hitting the mark.this one almost hit, great acting can only carry a movie so far.a combining of h.p. lovecraft,and frank peretti was a good idea.all's it needed was better back story, and better character development to make it great movie.the visuals are not that bad,also smart holding off the demons till the last few minutes helped keep the suspense at a good pace.could of used a better ending though.not a bad premise having terrorists experiments go wrong.much better than typical hollywood treatment about the demonic realm.maybe someone will finally do "this present darkness" as a movie.
