in 2023, in a world ruled by the economical interests of the great corporations (and not by the people will or politicians), kam (bobbie phillips) is a human hybrid and ibi (international bureau of investigation) agent. she is denominated a `sub'(from sub-human), and her genetic composition is 80% human and 20% animal. she has a combination of genes of cougar, that gives her strength and flexibility; falcon, that giver her a increased capacity of seeing and hearing; and chameleon, that gives her the power of camouflage. in the first film, she was a very seductive and amoral woman, using sex to achieve information. i do not have watched the second yet, but in this third one, the story is full of action. a group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years. the research has not been concluded yet, when one of them betrayal the other and steals the research. the problem is that, due to its molecular instability, a black hole will be created and will suck the whole planet. kam saves dr. tess adkins (teal redmann), the survival of the team of scientist, and tries to retrieve the dangerous invent from the hands of the `bad guys'. there is a very strong `sub' in this gang that causes many difficulties for kam. this action and sci-fi television movie is better than the first one, recalling `the terminator' in some parts of the plot. bobbie phillips is a very beautiful actress, and her outfit is very cool. i am becoming a fan of this good entertainment. fans of sci-fi movies will not be disappointed. now i am trying to buy `chameleon 2'. my vote is seven.
