i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it. i loved the storyline and the actors. it has a little of everything. i was completely taken by the unfolding of the story. it has so many surprises along the way. i highly recommend it. in fact, i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book. i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie. i also wanted to make sure i didn't miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie. i recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. it has become my favorite movie. i am now a sarah waters and elaine cassidy fan!!
