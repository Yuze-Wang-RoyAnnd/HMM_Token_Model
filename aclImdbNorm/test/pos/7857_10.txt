this movie is not what it appears to be. clint eastwood is not dirty harry or a "cowboy" here. the movie's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme. it's a gothic tale set in the civil war and as such all the film's "action", or lack thereof, takes place inside a house populated by southern belles of all ages and shapes.<br /><br />the horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of the clint eastwood character. seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by the women is a very "beguiling" experience indeed. and who is "beguiled" here exactly? are the women beguiled by eastwood's incredible looks? are we, the viewers, beguiled by both his sexual allure and the potential deviant sexualities it unleashes? or does "beguiled" refer to what the director does here-- holds us enthralled for a short space only to (maybe)let us go? don siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films i had the pleasure of watching.
