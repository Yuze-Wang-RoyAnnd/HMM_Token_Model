family guy is the best show on tv. ever. it has achieved great things that no other animated sitcom, or any show, has even come close to achieving.<br /><br />in terms of animated sitcoms, this era should be referred to as "the era of animated sitcoms" because there are so many of them, and almost every one of them imaginable is being released on dvd. there are some good ones (i.e. south park, futurama, and the simpsons). every animated sitcom has its own style/technique of creating humor. for instance, futurama is funny because it always comments or acts on what just happened with a touch of humor. the simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same comedic technique and style that futurama does, but the simpsons deserves the credit for it since it was on the air way before futurama and still remains on the air using the technique. south park, in my mind, is the funniest show next to family guy, because it uses a smart blend of vulgarity and silliness as it's technique of creating humor.<br /><br />but enough about other animated shows. let me tell you what makes family guy so funny. family guy uses a comedic style that no other show has ever used before. it uses a technique of having flashbacks occur after every joke. this not only reinforces the joke, but makes it seem funnier. it also moves at a very quick pace. these two criteria make it the funniest show on tv. you have to see the show to believe it, but once you see it, you will most likely agree. (fyi, the two funniest moments on family guy were: 1) the 5 minute chicken fight in "da boom", and 2) the dick van dyke spoof in "holy crap.") also, in my mind family guy is a very modest show because while other shows create humor by getting familiar with their shticks/routines and characters, most of family guy's jokes are based on the silliness of current events and pop culture. this also shows that family guy is intelligent, in addition to being modest, because it reveals that the show has insight. and this technique is extremely effective because they relate their pop culture references to the particular plot of the episode they are found in.<br /><br />family guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because while younger children may not understand the pop culture references, they will be amused by the hilarious, silly antics of the characters, especially peter. the show is, however, a little bit more vulgar than the simpsons and futurama, but it is less vulgar than south park. so, in terms of vulgarity, family guy would rank somewhere in the middle when associated with the above shows, but it would rank no. 1 in terms humor and intelligence!!<br /><br />sadly, it was cancelled last year, not because it wasn't popular, but because fox kept changing it's time slot, so no one ever knew when it was on. luckily, we've got the dvd box sets (which, by the way, are selling like crazy) and reruns on cartoon network's adult swim available to us.
