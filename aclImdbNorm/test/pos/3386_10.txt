i first saw this mini-series as a child and though i am a child no longer, i still love it!!! professional copies are hard to find, however, when it's on dvd, it's mine!!! =]<br /><br />great casting, marvellous plots, and plenty of action, romance, and even quite a bit of well-placed comedy. i'm not a historian by nature, but i love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
