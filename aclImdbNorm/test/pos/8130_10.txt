the biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of u.s. distribution. i was fortunate enough to see this film at the boston international festival of women's cinema, and highly recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it. terrific performances, and thoughtful script and great direction from the talented and funny rose troche all combine to make this film a winner!
