those prophetic words were spoken by william holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous jennifer jones (as a eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. they start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. in hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. beautiful hong kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by alfred newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially jones (directed here by henry king, who also did "the song of bernadette - 1943, an oscar for jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper.
