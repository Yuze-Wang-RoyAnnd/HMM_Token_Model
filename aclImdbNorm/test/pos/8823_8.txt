a lot of my childhood was spent lying in front of the wireless listening to round the horne or hancock's half hour or watching carry on films. probably the most famous line in comedy "infamy! infamy! they've all got it infamy!" still makes me laugh.<br /><br />this is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy right down to the final quotation from the coroner's court read in four different voices by michael sheen. he was brilliant in the role. most of the other members of the carry on team were so-so and their kenneth horne was very good but michael sheen carried the show and there should be an award of some sort for him.<br /><br />it left me feeling "wow". to quote kenneth williams, to the cynic who says 'life is a joke' the only response can be 'yes, well let's make it a good one.'
