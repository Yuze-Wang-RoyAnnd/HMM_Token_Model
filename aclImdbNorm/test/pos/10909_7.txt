i remember seeing this a long while ago, and i knew most of the concept, but no detail, so i'm glad i watched it again, from director frank oz (the muppets take manhattan, bowfinger). basically new star cameron drake (matt dillon) has just won the academy award for his latest, where he plays a gay soldier, and he does the usual "thank yous", he even mentions his past school english teacher howard brackett (golden globe nominated kevin kline), and he outs him as gay! howard is determined to clear his name, and get out of the media spotlight as a denying gay man, especially as his marriage to emily montgomery (oscar and golden globe nominated joan cusack) is on the way. so it comes to the wedding day, and when it comes to howard saying yes or no, that is when he outs himself, and admits to himself and everyone, that he is gay. this of course gets him fired as a teacher, but everyone stands at the graduation day to out themselves (in support), and cameron even shows up to clear things up, so that everyone, especially school head tom halliwell (elf's bob newhart) knows it's okay to be gay. also starring tom selleck as peter malloy, debbie reynolds as berniece brackett, wilford brimley as frank brackett, gregory jbara as walter brackett, glenn close, whoopi goldberg and jay leno. the highlight of the film has to be when kline can't help dancing to diana ross's version of "i will survive", that must have been what convinced him of his sexuality. kline is always good, cusack is a surprise oscar nominee, and all supporting cast members do their bit too in this very funny comedy. very good!
