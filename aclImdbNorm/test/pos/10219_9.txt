this movie is masterly directed by clive barker, he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters. i think there is a sequel missing for this one, barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions, that is one i think was a real garbage. but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films.
