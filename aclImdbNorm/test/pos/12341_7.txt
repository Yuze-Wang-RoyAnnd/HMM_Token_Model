thorn-bmi is out of business, before they stopped making films they made a chiller of a movie. using e.s.p. and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father mastered a terrible power. only in the death of her father did olivia find that her father dubbed 'raymar' from raymarkovitch had really murdered 6 girls and was planning two more by using the technique of psyhic vampirism.<br /><br />our picture starts with 6 coroner wagons pulling in and music to match the grusome discovery of the 6 girls. dead all with their eyes wide open in a closet. in the walls were all kinds of objects, the coroners men were pulling up an old man, when blue lightning hit the ceiling which caused a circular hole to form only made the film more bizarre!<br /><br />if you like extremely chilling scenes this for you. unless you can see dead bodies from years ago in each level of decay, don't view it without a friendly companion. like "the changeling" it has some heart stopping horror in it. i gave this a rating of 7 it's in color, actress meg tilly debuted in this film if you can find it see it.
