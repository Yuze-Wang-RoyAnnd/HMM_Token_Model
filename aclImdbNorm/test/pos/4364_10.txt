i consider this a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward: a vietnam survivor tells his harrowing tale and some of the story is reenacted on location. reviewers sometimes even claim that herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. we know that all documentaries are "mediated" to some extent and this one has herzog's subtle hand all over it, most notably in the stunning music, the unbelievably expert selection of archival footage, and the management of cascading images. the evocative power of this film is astounding, starting with its title, the opening title card from the book of "revelation," and the initial voice-over. this is a movie that one can watch repeatedly with increasing wonder, not a simple commodity that is gulped down with one's favorite beverage on the way to the evening news. this is one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime.
