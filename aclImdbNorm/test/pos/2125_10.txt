i have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is princess genevieve, and all her sisters. i definitely recommend this movie for all young girls. this movie is one of the best from the barbie collection. it shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls. with the great songs and dance moves, it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves. the extras are also good, one even works on how good your memory is. i would definitely have say it is a must see for kids and grown-ups alike.
