for comedy to work, there are many factors involved:<br /><br />1. don't be afraid to take risks. 2. if anyone or anything deserves to be poked fun at, do it and continue to do it,<br /><br />...but most of all:<br /><br />3. be funny!!!!<br /><br />"the chaser's war on everything" succeeds in all those three things. in fact, the show proved to be so popular and so funny that already only months after it's first episode, a dvd of the first season was released. i picked it up within days of it being released and hit the floor laughing and had so many fu#@ing tears in my eyes- it's that well, good!<br /><br />in short and to save me blabbing on about the show- watch it, buy it, podcast it, whatever will make you watch the fu$#ing best show in the world!!!!!<br /><br />go the chaser!!!!
