"two hands" is a hilarious australian gangster movie set in really sultry sydney. i bet tourists never envisage sydney and bondi to look like it did in this film: all sweaty bodies, oppressive nighttime and gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. heath ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on becoming part of the local king's cross boss's gang. he looked rather magnificent in his green wife beater and blue patterned budgie smuggler. a sweaty tattooed bod does become him. i always had him down as a "home & away" boy, and he has been in that soap, which is a little sweatier than the weetbix-insipid "neighbours". the film is really worth watching for its combination of sardonic humour and nasty violence - the drowning scene is expected to give me nightmares soon. totty awards: country girl love interest city brother and tattooed streetkid.
