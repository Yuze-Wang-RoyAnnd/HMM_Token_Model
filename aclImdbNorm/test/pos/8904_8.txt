... but i laughed. a lot.<br /><br />i saw 'ast'erix et les vikings' at a public screening during the world cup. the sound was lousy, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but i still enjoyed myself immensely. the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor: smsix, abba, vikea... all not very witty, but in good ast'erix tradition. some very good jokes, but also some that not everybody seemed to get.<br /><br />the only thing i didn't like were the voices of ast'erix and ob'elix, in the german version at least. the voice actors are very well-known around here, which was the only reason they were casted, really. they don't fit the characters at all.<br /><br />all in all, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, like in my case, all the better) and to have a couple of laughs. 8 out of 10.
