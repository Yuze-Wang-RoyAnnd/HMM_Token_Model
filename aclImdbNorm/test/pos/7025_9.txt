i didn't understand what that line meant... i do now. i didn't really want to see dirty dancing either. i'd rented it out but never watched it - and today i did. and i thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. alright, it was cheesy at times... but it's still a great movie. i can't believe jennifer grey was 27 in this movie - my friend and i thought she looked about 18 or 19 - 20 at the most. i guess this is attributed to her acting talent. and she did really look awkward at times. patrick swayze is also very good, but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old. nevertheless, still very good. i love 80s songs so it really struck a chord with me, and the love story (yes, i'm a romantic) was so wonderfully done. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. exceeded my expectations!
