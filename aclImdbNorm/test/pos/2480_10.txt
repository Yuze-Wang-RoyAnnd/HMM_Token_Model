first of all, the entire script is mostly improv, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary. secondly, the actors hired by watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. the hippies portrayed are actual hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government themselves) are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several of the cops are actual policemen. the interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms alloted by watkins, eventually come to a violent head where even watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot. (we hear him screaming "cut! cut!" in the background.)<br /><br />an amazing film though american critics were quite harsh in their reviews, one actually reporting that it was the "most offensive" film she had ever seen. this not entirely unexpected as the unveiling of this oppressive communist-like mentality of america during this era would certainly rattle some cages. this pseudo-documentary definitely requires an open mind, though if you are seriously looking for an intensely accurate portrayal of 60s culture, this would be the film to watch.
