frank sinatra took this role, chewed it up with the rest of the scenery and - spat it out his way. tmwtga is stagey, the ending is trite, some of the scenes need a little more cutting, but that's all. it's great entertainment from start to finish, and while you watch it you realise that sinatra, that long-dead mor crooner, had junkies, gangster card games and the whole us urban hustle thing in his blood - he didn't learn it from an acting coach. there are all sorts of directorial touches to keep you amused, and the (non-dated) soundtrack cooks all the way. the marathon card game beat goodfellas, sopranos, etc. by forty years! so it wasn't faithful to the book? what movie is? and i can't imagine it being remembered if brando had been let loose on it; the cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing, instead of edgy, convincing and moving with sinatra. no-one else has mentioned the seedy, lazy, cynical cops - absolutely spot on! and eleanor parker would have driven *me* to smack.
