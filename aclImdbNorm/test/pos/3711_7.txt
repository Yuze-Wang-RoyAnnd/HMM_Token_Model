this oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by william faulkner, takes us back to small-town tennessee in december 1941. two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the south around this time). well, the japanese bomb pearl harbor and the older brother, pete, decides to enlist. he gives his prize egg to his little brother, willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. well, willie isn't having any of it, if pete can be a soldier so can he. he heads to memphis, showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way. after finding the enlistment center in memphis, he demands to see his brother, pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process. we are shown the devotion and love of a little brother (jonathan furr). he delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strong-willed boy in the gentler times of yesteryear. the movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one's youth. as the two brothers reunite shortly, the movie delivers a cathartic cry as the brotherly love envelops us all.<br /><br />this movie is like a cold bottle of water. maybe dasani or aquafina, good, clear water with a flavorful mineral packet, but not pure natural spring water like evian. still, it quenches your thirst and you don't doubt its purity and quenching effects. it is more run of the mill and less expensive than some, but gets the job done, leaving one refreshed and detoxified afterwards. 7/10
