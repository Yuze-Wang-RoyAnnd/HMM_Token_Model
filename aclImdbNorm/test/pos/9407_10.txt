i thought this movie was excellent. jon foster is one of my top favorite actors, he was perfect as micheal skakel. i found everything about it to be great, acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, script and music, etc.<br /><br />spoilers coming up! you have been warned!<br /><br />martha moxley, who they had tell the story in the movie was bludgeoned to death by her violent troubled neighbor micheal skakel. micheal did this out of jealousy of his brother tommy when martha rejected him and took tommy instead. thankfully though, they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. although, i think he should have been sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of parole.<br /><br />kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. two thumbs way up.
