i'm a big fan of naruto, even though i haven't watched every episode or read every manga.<br /><br />i really liked the first naruto movie, and to tell you the truth i was a little nervous that this one wouldn't be as good (or action packed) as the first (mainly because this one in australia only had a pg instead of an m, which is a pg-13 us or 12 uk). but i was wrong (thankfully)! the animation was more improved (although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed) and was very good especially in the fight scenes.<br /><br />speaking of that, let's talk about the fight scenes! the animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining! i especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with kankuro and the fight with gaara fighting the shape shifting female warriors! all the characters you want are here! naruto, sakura, gaara, kankuro and shikamaru! if only temari was in the movie, shikamaru could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion! and maybe they could have a passionate kiss! in my summary at the top i say that this qualify's more as a piece of cinema than just an extended episode. and it does! the action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting! overall, this is a excellent anime film that is a must-see for any naruto fan! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! alright i'll stop!
