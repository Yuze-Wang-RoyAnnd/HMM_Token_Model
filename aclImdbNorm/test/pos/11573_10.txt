this is probably the best movie filmed in at least the last five years. i've always believed that making people cry is far more difficult than making them laugh. if you want to see 400 adults crying out loud in the same room, go see this movie. it's breathtaking. javier bardem performs the role of his life. you will cry, you will laugh, you will smile... the most deserving fact is that in spain everybody knows about ramon sampedro. personally i knew the full story and even the end of it. so, the excellence of the movie is in the way that the story is told. and in this field, amenabar is a the master.<br /><br />this movie is a must.
