"haggard: the movie" is well written, well directed, and well acted. there are many laugh out loud moments and some terrific skateboarding scenes featuring margera. the scenes of west chester, pa are filmed beautifully and the script is just downright funny. what i like about the movie is that instead of being another sappy love story or another version of "jackass", it takes a darkly funny look at break-ups from a different perspective. most break-up films feature a naive woman jilted by a cheating man. she then goes on to find mr. right and gets to tell her cheating ex to get lost. this movie takes a look at the emotional roller-coaster of a jilted man... without taking itself too seriously. ryan dunn does an excellent job as the jilted man and with bam margera and brandon dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this rough time, how can you take anything too seriously? it is obvious that margera and co. are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera. i look forward to their future films and endeavors.
