i had been waiting to see this movie for so long and finally got to yesterday. in summary i'm glad i finally did. the humor is off the wall hilarious. the plot is so unbelievably believable that it has to have at least some truth for it . if anything stood out in this movie it is most definitely the coffee shop scene. i have been there every guy has . you get dumped. you find out that your ex has fooled around with some guy who you are sure is an asshole. now every time you see anything for the next few days you just get horrible thoughts of this placed in all the wrong areas . she is screwing everyone and everyone knows it. i could probably watch that man lick and finger his wallet all day long and look back at myself and laugh for having been there too .
