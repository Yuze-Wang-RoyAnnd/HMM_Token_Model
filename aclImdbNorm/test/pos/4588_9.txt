mike judge's idiocracy is an interesting film, and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see.<br /><br />before i start the review, i would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely do, as it is worth watching, and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down.<br /><br />let's start with the premise - luke wilson is private joe bauers, an army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws, making him totally average in every way. this, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. also frozen with joe is a prostitute named rita who was pimped to the project by upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the top secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten about.<br /><br />they wake up in 2505, and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp. the way that "everyman" joe bauers talks is seen as being "faggy", much as someone speaking like shakespeare would ridiculed now, and a former professional wrestler is the president of the united states (actually, this one probably isn't that outrageous really). the best show on tv is called "ow! my balls!", which admittedly sounds pretty good, and not only is everything spelled wrong, but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording, leaving them to be bunched up at the end.<br /><br />it's a funny premise for film, but this is the problem - aside from the initial premise, not that much in the movie is truly funny. what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself. obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier.<br /><br />there are some winners in the script, such as starbucks now offering "happy endings", and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood "electrolytes", but they are just too few and far between, so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slack-jawed, profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and/or intelligence, then the laughs might be pretty well spaced.<br /><br />it's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to office space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, regardless of what came before it, idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film.<br /><br />i give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable, but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road.
