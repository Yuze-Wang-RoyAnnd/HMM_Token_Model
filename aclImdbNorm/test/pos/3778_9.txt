this film was one of three that were later combined by chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title "the chaplin review".<br /><br />this was an odd film in some ways because later in life, chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. this film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the us efforts in wwi. it's truly odd to see charlie as the "super soldier" who single-handedly captures 13 germans, casually and coolly shoots several germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the kaiser himself! truly, this was a major departure for the little tramp, though it was, at the same time, very very entertaining and funny. the film is exceptionally well-paced, well made and i'm sure did a lot to bolster support at home for our troops (too bad it was such a pointless and costly war).
