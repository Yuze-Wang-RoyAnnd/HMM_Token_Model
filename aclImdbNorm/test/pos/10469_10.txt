food always makes a good topic in movies, as "chocolat" showed. "babette's feast" is the same type of thing. babette harsant (stephane audran) is a french cook who flees her native land after the repression of 1871. she moves to a very religious danish village. the people in this village simply have no use for joy. that is, until babette cooks them one of her exquisite meals.<br /><br />it's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it. like other scandinavian movies (and non-hollywood movies in general), it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.<br /><br />one more thing. do you think that the danish word for "feast" sounds a little bit like "tastebud"?
