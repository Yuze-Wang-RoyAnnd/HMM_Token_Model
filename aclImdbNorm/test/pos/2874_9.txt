see no evil is the first film from wwe films. yes wwe, word wrestling entertainment, pro wrestling. of course being that it's a wwe film a wrestler has to star in it, the wrestler being glenn jacobs aka kane. which is not really important as if you didn't know kane or what wwe stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. see no evil is gross out horror film, it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying, hey look how gross we can get! not that there is anything wrong with that. jacob goodnight (played by kane) is sort of a jason type character, his mother tortured him as a kid with strict (understatement) christian beliefs and has warped his mind. now he's a big scary chopping killing machine. 90% of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where jacob stalks six teenagers (surprised?) and a handful of adults. i could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh, who cares? despite it's lack of originality see no evil is well made, for what it's supposed to be. kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary. one flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive, i really looking forward to having them being horribly killed, but alas, does not happen. i wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although like i said the film has nothing to with wrestling, people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because, given of course if they are a wrestling hater. then again the movie may also make money because wrestling fans will want to see it. either way, see no evil has top notch effects and little cgi, and like i said, it's quite brutal so like i say it's good stuff....if you like that sort of thing.
