i watch this movie without big expectations, i think everyone should do. it's a great tv-serie and of course we couldn't compare it with gone with the wind, but it's still nice to watch. it's also weird to see a different scarlett. joanne whalley don't play scarlett with passion and fire like vivien leigh, but i believe that scarlett is changed when she became older. don't expect to much of this just watch but don't watch like: i think this would be horrible.
