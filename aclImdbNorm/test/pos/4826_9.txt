i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night, into woods that scared her in the daytime, this movie was pretty good. had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains, maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave idiotically, but still manage to get into danger. it worked for the plumber and the fellow in the trailer, but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots, for the director to get closure in ending this film.<br /><br />atmosphere was great, scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me... i live in a wooded area, so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while. the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned. raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten...
