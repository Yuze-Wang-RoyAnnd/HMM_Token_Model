ok, i don't kid myself that this is the typical gay love life but since when are straight romances in real life as they are on the screen? this movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself. it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren (tom hollander). and having seen him in priscilla, queen of the desert only the day before, he is probably one of the most secure-in-their-masculinity actors around. :) anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot. thumbs up! 8/10
