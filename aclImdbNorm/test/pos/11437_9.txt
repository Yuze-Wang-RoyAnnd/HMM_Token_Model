this is an enjoyable movie. its very realistic to the "wonderful world of music" i've been there and done that. it shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect. these amateur musicians weren't all that bad players. cleavon little's character, marshall tucker, was played very well. marshall was no saint himself. here he was getting paid to do a job and he's giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there. you don't bite the hands that feed you. i do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, claims he does not know any of the dixieland tunes. he has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes to tunes he does not know. not common, but not unheard of either. he delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the movie when he tells the clarinet player, "its not a religion, devotion is not enough." on that level, he is correct, although i think the clarinet player could have handled the job. he was practicing his butt off and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read. very enjoyable movie.
