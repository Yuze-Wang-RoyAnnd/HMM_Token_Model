i always liked this movie, i have seen it so many times but i always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. but the only thing i have to disagree with is that i don't think max lived in a romanian monastery or what was that :p they don't look that way in romania.. anyway, back to the story, ghita muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his english needs to improve. <br /><br />and there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. it worths being seen, i thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love. i recommended to you all. it's not the best movie ever, but it was nice!
