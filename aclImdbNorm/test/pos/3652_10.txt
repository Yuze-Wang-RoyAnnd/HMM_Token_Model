i just saw this at the philadelphia film festival. it was the most wonderful movie - the best i've seen in quite a while. the enticing character of isa is an open, exploring and (as remarked in the film) love-filled person - guilelessly portrayed by the beautiful camille natta. the accompanying music is soothing and transporting, a balm to the soul.<br /><br />each character seems to be conflicted in some way - and their interactions (w/ conflicts) make for a great story. the tale told by a.k. hangal as the old man was most magically done - i wanted it to go on and on.<br /><br />that hari seemed to remember his "place" throughout added get power to the story - a refreshing change to the bubble-headed plots of many modern writers.<br /><br />all and all, an excellent film. go see.
