the first time you watch this movie you may hate it, but the 2nd time you see this movie i guarantee laughs all around. the owners of the dogs are so ecclectic that you can't help but look at them and laugh. from the littlest toy poodle to the announcer, everything will make you laugh. and you may learn every single nut there is!
