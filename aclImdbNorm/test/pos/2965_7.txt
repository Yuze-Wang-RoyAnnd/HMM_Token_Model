to sum this story up in a few sentences: a teenage girl (amy) uses her hot body and "supposed" virginity to entice a young troubled guy (matt) with a potential football scholarship to provide her a "full ride" out of town. come to find out she has quite the reputation & has slept with many football players in the past hoping they would offer her the same deal. both of these kids have come from troubled & dysfunctional homes. matt's mothers a alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends & amy's mother had a bad reputation herself & got pregnant with amy at a a young age. matt falls in love with amy & tries to straighten out his life for her. very predictable ending. the actress that plays "amy" is actually 33 years old trying to play a teenager!
