i cant believe how many excellent actors can be on one show. it's the realism and fine acting that makes it look real. this has got to be the best comedy ever created to this day and i love seinfeld and everyone loves ramond. it is just fabulous and it seems everyone in my family agrees. thats no isolated opinion of mine. the whole world seems to talk about different incidents and they try to reenact them. my hat off to the crew. some shows have an actor that makes the whole show. this plot comedy has a slew (8) of them . that's what makes it so amazing. some people pray for health , wealth or fame. i pray that the show never ends. sicerely john. lkhubble2@talkamerica.net
