watch this movie just to see shahrukh khan say "i love you,k-k-kiran..." it's both heartbreaking and frightening at the same time when he says this, from the beginning to the end. this movie made him famous, and i totally recommend it :d it's highly entertaining, the music's wicked and you will laugh right along with shahrukh here...you'll genuinely feel scared for the hero and heroine and oddly enough you will identify with at least one of the characters. you will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time. go see this classic bollywood movie with your good buddies and some lovely food and have a day in. and after you see the movie, have the songs and scenery playing in your mind...forever.
