my girls 4 and 6 love this show. we stumbled across it on a pbs station and they always ask when its on now. it reminds them of their grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer. its funny too and sometimes they can't stopped talking about one scene or another. i would definitely recommend this show to all young kids. it is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching tv all day long. when nana reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with mona. it reminds me to slow down when i read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to get them to sleep.
