a very great movie.<br /><br />a big love story. lots of sword fighting. huge battle scenes. heros and villains. real history.<br /><br />few in the west know much chinese history. chin zchaundi founded china. the country is in fact named after him. some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed. this is a historical epic of how he ended the period of contending states and unified china. he founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the han dynasty that permanently defined chinese civilization ever since.<br /><br />chin (or the king of zheng as he was known before he founded the empire)was roughly contemporaneous with scipio, hannibal, and fabius in the west. the parallel roman world dominance (west and east worlds) was achieved without a single towering personality like chin. it would not be for another century before the west produced caesar - the nearest comparable western figure.<br /><br />chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot. history only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film. the famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be. gong li is lovely. she is the emotional core of the story. it all makes for great movie making.
