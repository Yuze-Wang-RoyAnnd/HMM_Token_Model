the cast is admirably chosen and well-balanced. this cinematography is excellent. the music is delightful as all of burt bacharach's music is, and is appropriate to the plot line. making a musical version of hilton's tale is a welcome change from a plodding re-make. we see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and significance of each scene. i cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this scintillating gem of a film. it is a treasure of the silver screen! find it if you can - and let its magic carry you beyond the drudgery of daily worries, inspiring you to find your own "lost horizon".
