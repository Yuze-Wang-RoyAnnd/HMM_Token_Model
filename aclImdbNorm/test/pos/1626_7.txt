still haven't read a single dan brown book, but i watched all his movies adaptations. i won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.<br /><br />the plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: i never been a great fan of hanks but he delivers well. i noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because i search for one like this in vain! the italian searcher is a brilliant newcomer for me but i really applauded ewan macgregor portrayal: his inner faith and calm is really impressive.<br /><br />i really like the debate between science and religion. the action taking place in the vatican, it felt like vacation. at last, i am not sure it helps to add new converts into christianism. with all the gold and man presence displayed, any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers.
