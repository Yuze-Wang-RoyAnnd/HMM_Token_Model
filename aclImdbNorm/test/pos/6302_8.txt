the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film. a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera, trailing a huge suitcase behind him. like the central character in the film, we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be way off the mark.<br /><br />consequences of love is that kind of film. from the title you might expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. what we have instead is a lead character, titta, living life in emotional exile, seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him. if the film can be classified in any way, i would call it a mystery, as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about. what we know from the start is he is 50'ish, cool, composed and expensively attired. he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel, always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guests.<br /><br />his only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with. the couple, it transpires, used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left. their love of money, antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight. he once had it all, but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. his brother, a long haired surf instructor, drops in to see him occasionally, but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure. they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend, even though he hasn't seen him for 25 years. this long lost friend is now a telephone engineer, repairing the communication network that brings so many together. meanwhile tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to him.<br /><br />midway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel. with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for good.<br /><br />the slow unfolding of tittas fall from grace is and beautifully scripted, shot and scored. the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed, the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions. the ending, with a visual nod to felini, is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motives.<br /><br />patrick bliss, 01/06/06
