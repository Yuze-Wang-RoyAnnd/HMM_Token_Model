my husband dragged me to this film as i had no interest in seeing some anime cartoon. i was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation. in a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous, imaginative hand drawn animation. the world of sosuke and ponyo is a vivid fantasyland intermixed with minimal reality. i haven't seen animation like this since i was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed.<br /><br />the actors supplying the voices in the english version were fabulous. the length of the movie was perfect, especially for children who tend to get squirrelly in films. overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays.
