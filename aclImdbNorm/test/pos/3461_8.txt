i was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. i was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. i guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. but i hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. the story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. this movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented. hopefully this movie will help us to understand some of their desires better and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you almost unable to express that fact.
