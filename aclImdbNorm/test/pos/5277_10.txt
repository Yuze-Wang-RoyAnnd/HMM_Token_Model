i absolutely, positively loved the movie. i just saw it and can't wait for it to come out on dvd. it is a beautifully, well-drawn masterpiece. i am always amazed with the intricately drawn work of ghibli studios. <br /><br />others have commented on sosuke calling risa by her first name. he never calls his father by his first name unless he is speaking about him to someone else. i didn't get the impression that risa was his mother. it was never even mentioned or implied by anyone. it is quite obvious that she is his step-mother. that is why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty car. his mother must have died when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by risa. this coupled with his father being out to sea a lot is why he has abandonment issues. everyone also talks about how mature he is. this usually occurs when a child loses a parent.
