i don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. it was great. classic bruce campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a bruce movie for you watch it for bruce. also ted rami was excellent. i found this movie hilarious and entertaining i still crack up when i recall bruce on that pink moped. now i will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like b movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear. but if you like slap stick and off the wall sci-fi plots this movie is for you.<br /><br />hail the king baby!
