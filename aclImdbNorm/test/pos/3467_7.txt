i went to the pre-screening of "rory o'shea was here." i like this movie better than i expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. it's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his duchenne muscular dystrophy. he can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. i guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. well, it is. but with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. it made me looking at my life for things i take for granted. what would i do if all i can do is to move my two fingers? i should feel grateful for what i have and what i am capable of doing. this is a good flick, although it could have been better.
