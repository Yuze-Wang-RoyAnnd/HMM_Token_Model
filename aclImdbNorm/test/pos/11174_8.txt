lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming, then this is it. before actually playing the game, there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games. fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thin.<br /><br />play the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed. from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat (!), to the closing stages in the funfair, the jokes just keep on coming. i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works (day of the tentacle, sam & max, etc) and this one does not fail to deliver the quality. you will not be disappointed. (well, i wasn't.)
