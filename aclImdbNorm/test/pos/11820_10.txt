very nice movie! i was browsing the channels on my tv and i usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then i saw this channel that airs old school movies and it is where i saw this movie. at first, when i saw the title "the cure" i thought it's gonna be boring but then i got hooked when i saw brad renfro was in this movie (because of one of my favorite movie of all time is "the client" where brad also stars). then the scenes was getting better and better. the story is so beautiful and very touching! i cried hard in this movie which i don't usually do. great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines/quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard! now, i bought my own copy on dvd and i always recommend it to everyone!
