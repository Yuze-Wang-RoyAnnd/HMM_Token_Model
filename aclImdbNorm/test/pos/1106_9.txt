received this dvd from the accent range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics, they released irreversible and a range of bergman's opus.<br /><br />the thing that struck me about alex frayne's strangely titled film modern love is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us into the mind of mr joe average, replete with voices in the head, visions, and madness. it's set in rural redneck australia, the film doesn't trivialise or praise the folks like so many australian movies. ie our films are full of "loveable rogues" or people with "hearts of gold" etc etc etc.<br /><br />not in this film. the spirit of stanley kubrick looms large here, it's not flawless, but has a mesmerising attention to details, a romantic streak and a mood that is bracing if not embraceable.<br /><br />minor quibbles...the transfer looks faulty - front credits were sliced, they don't fit in frame.<br /><br />also, one of the short films is corrupted, it stops half way.
