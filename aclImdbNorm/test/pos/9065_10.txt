i really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me, emotionally, spiritually and just plain silly stuff. i didn't get caught up in "believability" in the screenplay or the actors and didn't even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in imdb for the movie. listening to michael parness talk at the q & a about his idea of the film, wanting to see how crazy people, or "f'ed" up people, as he put it, fall in love is really interesting. i identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at it's best. i like watching david krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now. i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone, just see this film to watch an amazing young actor. i agree that guillermo d'iaz really was a scene stealer, and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment. i laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didn't win any awards at the festival. i question why that didn't happen. i gave max and grace a ten because these interesting, unique, creative indie films deserve an audience. technically watching this film, it's really beautifully done
