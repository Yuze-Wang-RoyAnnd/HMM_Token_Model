i saw this film much like skywalker02 did, but when i could manage to see it again and with formal film training, psychology, and life has had the time to really take me by the hand and start beating me about,..i really click with the film. i remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death, much like poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular films. i felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant "airtime" (i know cable isn't really on air) given it, but i was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked. however, recent viewing of the film has enlightened me on the film. i think that susan surandon and molly ringwald were likely studying the script together, and i would be a bit surprised if surandon had coached ringwald during this project. ringwald's other projects, while good, do not have her exhibiting the potential depth as this role. surandon nailed hers, as raul julia did also. cassavettes and wife delivered acceptable performances, but i will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre. a steady ebb and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes, but overall i can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle.<br /><br />all in all, i don't find this film to be the "take me out and drown me" kind of boredom fest as skywalker02 would have you believe. i think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed, coupled with some film courses perhaps this film would appear different. i would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and yearn for a simpler life, and you have had your share of marital discord amongst dysfunctional family units, then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. i do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements, such as terms of endearment which as far as i am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by jack nicholson, then ceremoniously burned until nothing is left. (how could a film like that get more attention than this one. talk about boredom.)best thing, don't take my word or anyone else's, see the film and support our industry.
