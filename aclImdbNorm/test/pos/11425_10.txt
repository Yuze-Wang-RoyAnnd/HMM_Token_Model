when i saw this movie for the first time i didn't believe my own eyes. in front of me there was a great -and well done- parody of valentino... see stan laurel bullfight that way is like to see an excellent fencer in action! it's a very good parody, rich of ideas, with a clever and charming stan... old and good like whiskey. (or the booze-up after that)
