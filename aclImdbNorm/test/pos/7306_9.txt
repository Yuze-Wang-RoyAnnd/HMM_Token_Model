i think several others have already commented on this film, but i liked it so well i wanted to just say how good a film this is. i gave it a rating of 9 out of 10. it did not get a 10 because it is very slow starting. i almost quit on it, but am glad i didn't. hang in there, it is well worth the wait.<br /><br />this is primarily a film about relationships: deceit, trust, and betrayal.<br /><br />michelle pfeiffer, jessica lange and jason robards all do bang up jobs in this movie.<br /><br />set in midwest farm country, jason robards character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. jason's character is getting older and he decides to set up a trust dividing the thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters. that's when the plot of this film really beginning cooking.<br /><br />sisters turn against each other due to misunderstandings rather than greed over the land. they also make some discoveries about each other's childhoods, and their present day marriages, including an adulterous affair, while the father becomes increasingly abusive, demanding and paranoid--until the terrible truth about everyone finally comes boiling out.<br /><br />this film really reached me emotionally, i got angry right along with some of the characters, and sad with them. i could feel their pain due to the excellent performances that were given.<br /><br />the ending was a bit of a surprise to me, but in keeping with the growth of the characters.<br /><br />
