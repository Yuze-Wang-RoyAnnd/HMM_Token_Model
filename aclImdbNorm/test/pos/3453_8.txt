wow! an amazing, lost piece of australiana and a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. this film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. as a retelling of the oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. the chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in australia will delight fans of the genre. this film used to be double featured with the rocky horror picture show, an indicator of the type of film that oz is. while not as frivolous or well constructed as rhps it's hard not to have fun with oz.<br /><br />surprisingly, oz has aged well- perhaps a by-product of how determinedly set in the real australia of 1976 it is. the passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream. the willingness of the film to give prominence to gay characters is notable, especially as it dates to the 'revolution' period for the australian gay rights push.<br /><br />the performances range from flinchingly amateur to finely nuanced brilliance. the direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two. somehow, these flaws add to the appeal of the film which is mercifully unpretentious. much like australia in the 1970s this film has a certain naive charm.<br /><br />there are several connections to the original australian stagings of the rocky horror show which will keep obsessives on their toes.<br /><br />oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favourite worthy of review. laugh at the atrocious 70s fashion, swing along with the ausrock soundtrack, leave any expectations at the door and oz is likely to delight.
