being a middle aged mom myself, i very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. <br /><br />diane lane beautifully portrays adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. <br /><br />i am not a big richard gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.<br /><br />criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies. when nicole kidman and hugh jackman fall in love riding across australia, with barely a conversation between them, its considered high romance. we get so much more here with rodanthe. she redeems him. he sets her free. its beautiful. <br /><br />the intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, fans into a flame of passion. how long it takes is irrelevant. perhaps the movie was a bit too subtle in the point that it was the letters they shared over the following year that deepened their relationship- again another real-life time-honored way to get to know a person.<br /><br />as much as i enjoyed the plot and themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. some lines rang so true, and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat. <br /><br />i also enjoyed the relationships with adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love.<br /><br />this is not a lighthearted romantic comedy, more a romantic drama. it does have a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow. <br /><br />the beach house is a work of art- fabulous. look for the driftwood bench on the porch in the first pan-over the house- very beautiful. i also enjoyed the music and scenery, which combined to create the effect of the location as being the third main character. it was this place away from their regular lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light.<br /><br />if you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry- get out the kleenex and enjoy this movie.
