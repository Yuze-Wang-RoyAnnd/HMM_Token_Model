this is probably the second best of the death wish movies. death wish 5 is the best one.<br /><br />death wish 3 reminds me of "west side story" with a new twist. not even the recent flick "gangs of new york" can measure up with one new york neighborhood in death wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. a gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.<br /><br />deborah raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence. so, like geri nichols in death wish ii, death wish iii scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. only the james bond love-interest scenes would do much better.<br /><br />and, in addition to his .38, kersee plays with this new gun called the wildey .475 magnum. it reminded me of the dirty harry movies when callahan used his .44 magnum in magnum force, sudden impact and dirty harry. the wildey gun packs a big punch and when kersey kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it.<br /><br />and that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader? well, that is something. kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weapon....that is way too military for him.
