some have commented on the subtitles not being a problem in this film - i beg to differ - the nuisances in the facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a fraction of a second. i tried to watch, on the dvd, in english to overcome this problem (don't make this mistake the result is a travesty). the only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles. an acting master class - not in the dialogue but body language.<br /><br />it is the little things - the postmaster/shop keeper puffs out his chest and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from !france!. the general's bemused expression as his delight in a bunch of perfect grapes elicits a biblical reference with a profundity worthy of 'being there'.<br /><br />the cinematography is awesome and the bleak minimalist village with its washed out colour just accentuates the sumptuousness of the feast when it comes. i have a friend who claims to be descended from the borgias and who's family motto is 'if it is worth doing, it is worth doing to excess' - amen.<br /><br />i laugh out loud and cry each time i watch this film
