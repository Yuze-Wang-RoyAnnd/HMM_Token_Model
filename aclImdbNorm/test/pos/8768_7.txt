excellent hitchcock thriller with robert cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm.<br /><br />this time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant.<br /><br />priscilla lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from california to n.y.<br /><br />there is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within. hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director.<br /><br />ironically, the film implodes at the very end. while we see what happens to the guy who killed cummings' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the upper crust of society.
