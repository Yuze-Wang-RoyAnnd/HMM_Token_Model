1983 was "the battle of the bonds". that year both roger moore and sean connery starred in two separate james bond film, the former (octopussy) was produced by the "official" makers of the bond films while the later (never say never again) was produced "unofficially" by a group led by kevin mcclory who held the film rights to thunderball. surprisingly enough is the "unofficial" film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that never say never again is a remake of thunderball.<br /><br />never say never again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film. it all starts with sean connery, returning to the play bond for the first time since 1971's diamonds are forever. connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in diamonds are forever. the bond of never say never again is the sleek and dangerous shark of dr. no or from russia with love, just a few years older. connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. the one downside to connery's age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. let's face it even connery, despite being in top physical shape, looks as odd as moore when he is bedding women half his age. yet despite this believability issue, never say never again shows connery in one of his better bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier bond performances.<br /><br />kim bassinger plays domino in one of her early film roles. bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. bassinger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. in fact she may well outshine her thunderball counter-part played by claudine auger.<br /><br />then there's the villain, maximilian largo played by klaus maria brandauer. brandauer's largo is everything a james bond film villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable none the less. brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other bond villains have fallen into by going over the top. brandauer plays largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.<br /><br />the excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. barbara carrera makes a fine henchwoman in fatima blush and the screen lights up when she appears. max von sydow a nice appearance as blofeld, though his appearance is more akin to a cameo. rowan atkinson makes an appearance as bond's bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. with all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the mi6 staff from edward fox's m who makes for a great contrast to bernard lee, pamela salem who make s affine moneypenny and the icing on the cake with alec mccowen's wonderful q. the supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of bernie casey as felix leiter and gavin o'herlihy as jack petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film.<br /><br />on top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients. from the opening central america sequence to the fight at shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase, this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part. the film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions, and all the things we expect from a bond film. irvin kershner, then fresh off doing the empire strikes back, brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.<br /><br />yet this film is far from perfect. never say never again is easily one of the most dated of the bond films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games. while technology dates any film after a time, this film's heavy reliance on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release. the script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of thunderball.<br /><br />yet for its predictability the script for never say never again is pretty good. the script sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy one liner (how many of the roger moore era scripts can you say that about?), some humorous situations, and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. once you look past he fact that it's a remake, there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.<br /><br />music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. due to the "unofficial" status of the film, the james bond theme could not be used. that said this could have shown with the right composer that a bond score without it could work. unfortunately michael legrand's score is far from adequate. legrand's score is totally out of place in a bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. to make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a james bond film.<br /><br />despite being heavily dated, somewhat predicable, and having a bad score never say never again is still a good bond film. with one of the best casts of any bond film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and some terrific dialogue, this film proves that "unofficial" isn't a bad thing. in fact it is is better then octopussy and the winner of "the battle of the bonds".
