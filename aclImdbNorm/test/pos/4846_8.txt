focus is another great movie starring william h. macy. i first discovered macy in fargo and i've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me. macy is the archetypal "nice guy with something to hide". in focus, he plays the role of lawrence newman, a loyal and hard-working stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home. the scene is set after world war ii, at the height of mccarthyism. newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically, anti-semite. after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failing eyesight.<br /><br />unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart, his wife (played by a great laura dern). as the film unravels, newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being jewish is akin to being an animal.<br /><br />the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal. the chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is.
