i wish the series had not ended so soon. although the acting may not be the greatest in the world, it does end on a positive note and does teach morals and values to the viewers. hilary swank did a good job of portraying a high school student who had lost her parents, etc. miyagi was great as in the previous 3!! if you are not into the happy ending, this movie, like the previous 3 in the series is not for you. this day in which we live you can not see enough about the bad guys getting what they deserve and the good guys coming out on top. the bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil. that is exactly what happens in this one. it is a great family movie. please see it if you have not already.
