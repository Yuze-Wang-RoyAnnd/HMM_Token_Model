considering this film was released 8 years before i was born, i don't feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time. back in january of 98 though, i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin,texas. the particular theme of films this night was "neglected 70's crime films" and boy was her right. "the gravy train(or the dion brothers, as it appeared this print)" was an absolute gem. wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time. rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh. margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well. i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it. in the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.
