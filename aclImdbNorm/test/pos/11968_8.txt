when i went to see this documentary on communist bloc musicals, i was expecting something totally demented, along the lines of a communist "cop rock." some scenes did deliver, including a rousing clip from a soviet film called "tractor drivers."<br /><br />you'd think that moviemakers given the task of making ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and espouse the party line face insurmountable odds. and yet, one of the surprises of "east side story" is that some of the films presented actually looked promising. one was a mid-1950s east german effort called "my wife wants to sing," in which, as the title implies, an unhappy hausfrau seeks to launch a singing career over the objections of her traditionally-minded husband.<br /><br />another genuinely interesting-looking movie, also from east germany, was called "midnight revue." in this film-within-a-film, the producers spoof their own creative plight with the story of a group of filmmakers under party orders to make a musical. (the on-screen filmmakers themselves get to do a musical number about avoiding "too hot" subjects very reminiscent in tone of the 1957 movie "silk stockings.")<br /><br />the documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration, but it's still a lot of fun to watch. (look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible.)
