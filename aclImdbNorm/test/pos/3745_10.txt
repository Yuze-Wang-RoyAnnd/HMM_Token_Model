before i talk about the ending of this film i will talk about the plot. some dude named gerald breaks his engagement to kitty and runs off to craven castle in scotland. after several months kitty and her aunt venture off to scottland. arriving at craven castle kitty finds that gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). gerald does not want them to stay but, kitty insist on staying by making excuses. one night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall. it scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they must stay longer. kitty becomes more worried about gerald after she tries to go in the maze but gerald catches her and is even meaner to her. kitty then sends for reinforcements, she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide. then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends(who don't really do anything). blah,blah, blah kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is. they somehow get separated and they try to find each other. but the aunt stumbles upon the creature...here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, what is the creature lurking in the shadows?...it is a giant frog!!! omg what is better than that! after seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs, oops i mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle. the frog then leaps out an open window. we then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us (oh yeah this movie was in 3-d). but you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap. it is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault, blah, blah and kitty and gerald get married. then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze, the only place where he was ever really happy ;).
