ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the movie (i have lived here my whole life), i have waited for this movie to come out. and i mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.<br /><br />the movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. in both i cried, there were moments that tore me up. i laughed and i smiled just as much. it's a great movie with a great story line.<br /><br />it's about never giving up on finding that one, the one that will change you forever. the one that will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new view of life.<br /><br />i have to say that it is possible to meet someone and have them change your life forever, which is what gere's character did to lane's. i met the love of my life and at once was completely captivated that i never forgot him or how smitten i was with him until i 'met' him again a year later. for me i could relate to this movie with my whole heart. i think that if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what i'm talking about. it's never too late to find your true love, great work ms. lane and mr. gere!
