the play is cleverly constructed - begin with the porter, rainbow - & let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes. the film follows the play with great faithfulness, working, no doubt, on the simple premise that it couldn't be bettered. now throw in a host of superb character actors - & the result is a resounding triumph.a definite must-see.
