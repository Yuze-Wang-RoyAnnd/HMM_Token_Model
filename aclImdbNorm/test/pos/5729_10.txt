ladies and gentlemen: the show begins with this documentary film. it's structured in three chapters, each one chronologically arranged. the first presents the classical physics and links to einstein. the second studies in depth the quantum physics and enters in string theory. the last reveals the everything theory... the difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way, with daily objects; although you must believe them without checking by yourself -if you are not a scientist- (and even if you are a scientist!!). the film is not a masterpiece by its fabulous technique or the way it's produced; what really imports is the story, and what a story!!!
