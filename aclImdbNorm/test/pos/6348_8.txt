let me say first off that i am a huge fan of the original series lonesome dove and the book it was based from. i have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews i'd heard about it. if tommy lee jones wasn't playing capt. call i didn't see the point. if larry mcmurtry wasn't involved why should i care? how wrong i was.<br /><br />this is in so many ways a worthy sequel to lonesome dove, maybe even more so than the dark mood of streets of laredo. the story, acting, production, cinematography are all top-notch. of course the script isn't as colorful as lonesome dove but it has it's moments. and, much to my surprise, there are bits of lonesome done in this series; the relationship between july and clara, completely dismissed in the prequel, is brought up here almost identical to the book, a most welcome surprise. the story isn't all roses, it has it's surprises too. by far the biggest surprise is jon voight's interpretation of capt. call. while not a direct copy of tommy lee jones' his is both faithful and unique to voight's credit. the cast is fantastic all across the board, and i don't think rick schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series. oliver reed practically steals the show here, he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him.<br /><br />it is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms, especially that the dvd is so affordable (i got the 2-disc set for $10.99, you can probably find it cheaper). it is in no way the disappointment that dead man's walk turned out (well, it was for me). and mcmurtry was involved with that one!
