this movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it. we knew it was there- every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. it almost became a joke... "i know, let's watch throw momma from the train"... i don't know why it was always turned down, it just was. little did we know what we were missing out on. it still befalls me why it took us so long...i mean it stars danny devito, billy crystal, and ann ramsy (who we referred to as "the lady from the goonies"), an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household. but there it sat for nearly ten years. until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longer....<br /><br />it was like finding king tut's tomb...<br /><br />no movie has ever made me laugh so hard, and i doubt any movie ever will. i had to rewind for almost every line because i was still laughing at the line that came before it, and lost ability to hear or pay attention. not just simple laughing, either... the kind of laughing that expends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. the kind of laughing that you cannot control, that causes rolling around and spasms, and tears and snot running down your face because it's just that freakin funny. once i learned the movie by heart i will say this effect has lessened, but i don't think i will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate. i think that's all i can say. i would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't enjoy it please don't let me know, i will probably be offended.
