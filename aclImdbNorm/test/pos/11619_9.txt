first off - this film will not be for everybody. there are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that by their nature alone will turn off many possible potential viewers. obviously from the reviews on this board - subconscious cruelty has divided those that have seen it. i'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons. i feel this was a very ambitious (and quite competently pulled off...) undertaking for a bunch of 18/19 year olds with no budget and little experience. i think that each aspect of the film - the direction, the acting (though the character's performances are more likened to stage or free-form performance because of the nature of the film...) the production, the fx, the score/sound design - all are far superior to many films i've seen that exceed these kids budget and experience ten-fold. i honestly haven't been this impressed with an "art-house" style horror film since nacho cerda's genesis...<br /><br />first off - i'm not going to pretend to understand and/or grasp all of the graphical content in this film - but knowing that this wasn't a straight-narrative type of film when i went into it, i wasn't disappointed with how it played out. subconscious cruelty is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of revolve around the theory of right brain/left brain lust/anger/psychosis vs. restraint/compassion/"normalcy". to very briefly give a synopsis of each "chapter":<br /><br />ovarian eyeball basically just has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut out of her abdomen. i'm sure it's symbolic of something - i don't think i was paying that much attention at that point and this one blows by pretty quick. <br /><br />the next "episode" - human larvae - is a nihilistic, horrific, genuinely creepy story of a guy who's both in love with and repulsed by his pregnant sister, who gives into his growing psychosis which leads up to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter. human larvae is the best of the bunch in my book, and will probably get under your skin. the dead-pan narrative dialog accentuates the growing tension as you know something horrible is going to happen - but you're not quite sure what it is. do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this film - don't do too much research on it. come into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and i think you be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode.<br /><br />rebirth has a bunch of people in a field screwing the ground and blowing trees and stuff. apparently an "arty" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something to that effect. not bad, but this one is pretty short too and i sorta missed the point on it...<br /><br />and right brain/martyrdom seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also along with human larvae, has some of the "hardest" images/messages of the whole feature...<br /><br />ovarian eyeball isn't anything to write home about, mainly because of it's very short running time but does make a decent segue into the insanity to come...and rebirth is also kind of short and not quite as thought provoking, but human larvae (especially) and right brain/martyrdom are so off-the-wall and well done that they more than make up for the other parts. i think the main reason that i liked this one so much is that as "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive" as it is, it is also done very beautifully and you can tell this was a real labor-of-love from those involved. nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed, and even if the content isn't completely decipherable, it's undeniably original - and that alone up's the points some in my book. not that every "weird art-house" film that has an unintelligible plot should be praised for it's "originality", but subconscious cruelty is the type of film that i do think i'll watch a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations i may gain from it. again, this film is absolutely not for everyone - with some very extreme scenes of gore, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious imagery, etc...that is definitely there to shock the viewer into taking a harder look at this film. i have to say it worked for me, and i'm anxiously awaiting the hussain/cerda collaboration that is rumored to come next. check this one out if you have the stomach for it - 9.5/10
