i say sadly because if you see this movie now, you realize how low our media has sunk- all the warning signs are in this movie.<br /><br />it's a great film, i think the last great james brooks film, but others may disagree. it has rich characters (who are believable as well), great acting, great writing, and although the music got a little cheesy, i even liked that.<br /><br />william hurt has never been better. holly hunter is stunning. and albert brooks walks away with every scene he's in- this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it's vital and important topic of the news, and how it's slowly being compromised in our nation.<br /><br />watch this with network for a truly fun and frightening evening.
