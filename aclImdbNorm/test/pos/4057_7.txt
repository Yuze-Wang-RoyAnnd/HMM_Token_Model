it's showtime! showtime is simply a bump in eddie murphy and robert deniro's careers. it's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not robert's. showtime is directed by tom dey and features some small roles from guys like william shatner and mos def.<br /><br />showtime is about two very different cops, mitch preston (deniro) and trey sellars (murphy). one takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat. they are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions, vcrs, etc. they then cross paths and a tv station wants a new reality tv show so they fight crime while they are on tv. mitch hates the publicity while trey loves it with his line, "it's showtime!" their tv antics and methods are shown on tv and they are the new "cops" show. the fun begins.<br /><br />overall, showtime is a fun action comedy. a good film but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards. however, it's rolls along as it treads and parodies reality tv shows. a good break from shows like cops. truly at the end, just a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />my rating: 7/10<br /><br />eliason a.
