there's no other word for it...fox dumped this out, with no marketing of any kind. nobody in the country, other than those who have been looking forward to this film, know anything about it. all the red flags have flown. it has to be a mess, it can't be anywhere near as good as office space, right? wrong. though office space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. it's a misfire on certain levels, but who's to blame is left to mystery.<br /><br />based on what is currently showing in theatres, i can say idiocracy is a good movie. it's funny, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. it's effective, sometimes ingenious. what it isn't as far as i can tell, is finished. we will see something come of this film again, whether it's an extended cut or reshoots. alone it can be hilarious. it's ballsy at times.<br /><br />leaving the theatre, looking around at the mall, i was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. it's not quite as damning a dystopia as 1984, but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture. and there doesn't seem to be much anybody can do about it. anyway, go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried.
