i feel very strongly that this film was just like waiting to exhale with white females in the 1950's. as in waiting to exhale, all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good. the only difference, besides the obvious, was that there wasn't much humor in this film. i would even say that it was tragic. only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere (hope lange's guy), but even then there was conflict in this relationship.<br /><br />the story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success. unfortunately for them, romance didn't seem to come easy although they were young, intelligent and attractive. this movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving suzy parker's character whose obsession of an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy.<br /><br />this is a must see.
