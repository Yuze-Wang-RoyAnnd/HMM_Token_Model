this movie was sooooooo good! it was hilarious! there are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it. john turturro and tim blake nelson were awesome as pete hogwallop and delmar! i love those guys! i love the adventures they went on, too. i definitely recommend this movie.<br /><br />also, the music in this movie is terrific! i love singing along with all of the songs!
