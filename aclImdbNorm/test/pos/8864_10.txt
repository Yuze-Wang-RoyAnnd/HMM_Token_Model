this is another one of those films that i remember staying up late to watch on tv, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. this is a great movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before cgi.<br /><br />set on an isolated base in antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (the thing from another world) left off. the american scientists discover a decimated norwegian base some miles distant. everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. the thing is brought back to the american base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. the thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses its path, but also absorbing them, making itself into whoever and whatever it wants. the film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. everyone is suspect, anyone can be the thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. the group splinters and fear rules supreme. who is the thing?<br /><br />the gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. i could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. the power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although i liked the original version, i prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. when it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.<br /><br />this is one of carpenters best films, right up there with the fog and halloween. all of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. this film has something for any lover of the horror genre. don't miss it.
