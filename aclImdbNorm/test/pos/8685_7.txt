algernon4's comment that ms paget's "ultra lewd dance in (this film) is the most erotic in the history of films" is certainly one doozy of an exaggeration. it isn't even debra paget's most erotic dance. her near nude gyrations in fritz lang's "the indian tomb" make this number look decidedly tame. as for being the most erotic in the history of dance. well! where do i start? salma hayek's performance as santanico pandemonium in "from dusk to dawn" (1996); jamie lee curtis in "true lies" (1994); jessica alba in "sin city" (2005); rose mcgowan in "terror planet" (2007); sheila kelley in "dancing at the blue iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />don't get me wrong. i love the sequence and have included it in my "cheesecake dance" series on youtube. i just think that making a claim like "most erotic in the history of film" is really going out on a very fragile limb.
