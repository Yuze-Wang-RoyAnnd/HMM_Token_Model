i feel very fortunate to have the chance to not only watch this film, but also learn more about this fascinating person and time. lumumba is an outstanding portrayal, giving a full sense of the story without falling into the usual hollywood trappings - yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the still-emerging independent congo. the film is brilliantly made, moving along at a pace that is consistently engaging. i look forward to seeing other raoul peck films, as well as more from eric ebouaney!
