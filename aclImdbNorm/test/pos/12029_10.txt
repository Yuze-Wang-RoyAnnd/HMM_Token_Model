i think that gost'ya iz buduschego is one of the best russians minis for teens. i think i were near 6-8 parts of the movie. "one boy form 6th grade found a time machine in the old house where nobody lived. and he goes to the 21st century, just 100 years in future. in future he meat pirates, they tried to steal a "milafon" - machine to read minds and a story started..." soundtrack for that movie was very popular in soviet union. everybody loved that movie which was on tv every year.
