certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film d buy this immediately! where else can you get a run down of 70~os fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the titanic~os sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named queen bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) with a filming style that~os a cross between a porno movie/dawn of the dead/ and car wash, you cannot go wrong. this is one to watch over and over again'eafter you put the kids to bed.
