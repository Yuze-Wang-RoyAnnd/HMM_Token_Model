last year was the 200th anniversary of charles darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "the origin of species", so it's fitting that jon amiel's "creation" got released. the movie focuses on the period of darwin's (paul bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.<br /><br />i guess that the movie overplayed darwin's tension with his religious wife emma (jennifer connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter annie, but i still like the thought of darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma. as it was, the us was one of the last countries in which "creation" found a distributor, due to the creationism-evolution debate (yes, it's still going on).<br /><br />all in all, this isn't a masterpiece, but i recommend it the same way that i recommend "inherit the wind". i hope that one day, the creationism-evolution debate won't be an issue. if this film helps put the debate to rest, then more power to everyone in the movie! also starring martha west, jeremy northam, toby jones and benedict cumberbatch.
