i first started watching the outer limits back in 95 when i was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week i couldn't wait for the next. how the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. this show manages to teach us about life, robotics, alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people. what really makes this a good show are the characters in each episode, they really show emotion and are really good actors. what you'll also notice each week is an actor/actress you'll know from a past show which is pretty neat in its own way.<br /><br />if you wanna chill out, and sit back with a good sci-fi show, then the outer limits is for you
