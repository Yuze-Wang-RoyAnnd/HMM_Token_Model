what the heck do people expect in horror films these days anyway. does is have to be something grisly like 'saw' or it's just crap...??? now, i don't claim to be an all knowing expert, but i'm about 47, i've seen and own literally thousands of films and i honestly think this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. believe me, i was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started, assuming it was gonna be awful and i was pleasantly surprised. it's no mamet script, that's for sure; but come on!!! with all the horrible garbage out there, especially in horror, i thought this one was way closer to the top of the pile than most.<br /><br />the director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. the editing and timing were very good. and it didn't resort to the tired, worn clich'e of excessive 'slasher' violence; for example ***** minor spoiler ***** during an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous (but tasty..., uh, i mean tasteful) nude shower scene i fully expect her to get sliced and diced; but, amazingly we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it ***** end minor spoiler ***** also, the tension was built very well, leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what. ***** spoiler ***** especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and pinnochio alone in the office; we see the doll actually talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. also, the mom sees pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty; so, are both the mom and daughter mentally ill...??? also there is the original 'killer' and what the mom had surmised about a possible evil influence. but even with all that, we are still not quite sure who was doing the killing ***** end spoiler ***** so, all in all, i believe that it was a good, strong, sincere effort to create some good ol' early full moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence. and with no typical sleaze thrown in for no reason (just the lovely, innocent, beautiful shower scene, which i will remember to the end of my days... : ) compared to the absolute mindless drivel out there, a definite, strong 8/10!!!
