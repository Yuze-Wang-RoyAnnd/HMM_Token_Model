such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent in writers and actors, such wonderful scenery that was the ultimate escapism for those in a land locked, sun deprived state. many of the actors went on to bigger things...another indicator that there was something wonderful sadly lost. i lived in columbus, ohio at the time, with all of my (now ex) husband's very large family in a chorus of 'no no!!' every time it would be yet again taken over by a baseball game broadcast. <br /><br />someone who wrote here mentioned it was up against 'rosanne'...all my ex and i noticed was that it was always always always preempted by baseball!!!! yes, fox really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing will ever equal it~! thank you for the memories of it.
