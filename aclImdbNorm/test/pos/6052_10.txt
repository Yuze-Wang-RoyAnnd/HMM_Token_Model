i have seen this movie and anybody who has every been with the marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. it is a must have for any collection. jack webb does an excellent job as the hard drill instructor. my father went to marine boot camp at camp penelton and says this movie is so accurate that he feels like he is back in basic training. there is a line in the movie where jack webbs character gets mad at a boot for killing a sand flea. well let me tel you there are nothing but sand fleas at the camp. i have been there and can appreciate it. as a matter of fact the exit to the camp is las puljas which in english means city of the fleas. you must watch the movie to appreciate what i am saying. anybody who is into wwii movies, all the battles start right here with the drill sgt. a must have for you collection
