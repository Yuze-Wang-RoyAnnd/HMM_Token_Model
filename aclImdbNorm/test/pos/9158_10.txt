as i recall, my family made a point to stay home on the night "nichols" was on (mondays? tuesdays? nbc?). it was a superb vehicle for james garner, very well written, great ensemble cast. his character very much like the "support your local..." films: retired gambler with mysterious past settles into town and has adventures every week. in fact, it seemed fairly obvious that it was the same character. it was just a charmer of a tv show. a sleeper, like "my world and welcome to it", which may have been its contemporary--i forget. i dearly wish these shows would be made available on dvd. it was just good tv. perhaps "briscoe county jr." come close, but only by a mile.
