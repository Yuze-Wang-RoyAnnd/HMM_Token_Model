this show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch. the stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good. there are lots of children in my family, boys and girls, and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch, but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the mystic knights. it is a wonderful show and i hope that they will continue to keep making it. all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all. we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job. we wish all of the actors, actresses, writers, directors, and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work.
