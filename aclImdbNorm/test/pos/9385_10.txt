this is seriously one of the best low budget, b movies that i have ever seen. i am not one to stand up and cheer during a movie, but this one was definitely worth it. obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well...eats is a subjective term i guess, it really secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into itself and dissolves them in it's acidy goodness. the best part of this movie is that william russ is one of the main characters. the typical family man actually started his career with this movie...and an afro. there is plenty of nudity in this flick, so obviously not for the children, but that should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. it is my belief that everyone needs a little death bed in their lives at some point or other, it's best to get it sooner than later.
