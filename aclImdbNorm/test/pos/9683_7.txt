despite the apparent structural similarity with the simpsons - loud fat dad, housewifey mum, 3 children, a pet, typical suburban home, family guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to the simpsons. its avid use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season. while some hit the nail on the head (the rhea perlman and danny devito bit in season 5 is spine-snappingly hilarious), others are less successful, coming across as contrived. and they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. (the jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting)<br /><br />the chemistry between stewie and brian griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that chris and meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family.<br /><br />however, the feature film stewie griffin: the untold story, is mindnumbingly horrible. thank goodness it went straight to dvd.<br /><br />contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial simpsons, seth macfarlane's approach with family guy is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and amazingly, a lot more brazen.<br /><br />creator of ren and stimpy, john kricfalusi, famously criticized family guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from a cartoonist's standpoint. i don't think it looks that bad though, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful.<br /><br />all in all, a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes.
