i just want to comment to the woman above, that the movie does credit beethoven in the begging. in the beginning credits they show it. thank you. i think this is an amazing movie. they picked just the right music for the mood of the movie, the animation is wonderful, and they picked the voices for the characters very well. it teaches children to never give up, and to always have hope. princess annika doesn't give up , and it shows children that they can do the same. the movie also has humor in in for all ages, parents and children, to laugh at. the colors in this movie are great, and kids can really feel good while they are watching it. i watched this movie for the first time, now i am a huge fan, and i'm sure your child will be too. walmart sells tons of barbie and the magic of pegasus stuff, so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they aren't watching it. thank you!
