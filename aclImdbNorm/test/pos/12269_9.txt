for me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings. its about the tangled lives of three very different people. holly hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. albert brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist. william hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block, news anchor.<br /><br />the classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating brookes in love with hunter but she of course is attracted to hurt.<br /><br />this film works on many levels. at the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time. its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance.<br /><br />but perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. this is personified by the meteoric career success of the hurt character in contrast to brookes relative decline.<br /><br />despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards.<br /><br />this film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected
