our reviewer from toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except note that it needs editing-the hand held technique gets really old, really fast). i saw this film last night in menerbes, france-we are in the luberon valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. they were all there in the salle de polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. polite, patient, genial. although my french is testy, i got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the "old" terror growers interviewed-esp. the one from a communist village in languedoc. he got a lot of laughs. this is unusual in france-laughing aloud. there is no question which side of the terror-globalization war they are on! sm
