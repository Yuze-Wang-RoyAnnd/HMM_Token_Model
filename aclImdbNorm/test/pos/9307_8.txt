we watched this movie in my chemistry class, so obviously it had educational value. i thought the film did a really good job of intertwining the subjects of the science, moral issues and personal experiences of the manhattan project, but wasn't exactly focused on strong acting. i would recommend this movie for the scientifically inclined or those interested in the moral issues behind fat man and little boy, but if the subject of nuclear bombs bores you, don't see it.
