2005 was one of the best year for movies. we had so many wonderful movies, like batman begins, sin city, corpse bride, a history of violence.....coming up we also got brokeback mountain, king kong....but if this year the only great movie that came out was everything is illuminated, then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought. the first movie as a director of the talented liev schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of elijah wood's best roles. he is perfect as jonathan, a curious man that heads for ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in world war ii. liev schreiber, who also writes the movie, conducts a masterpiece, with memorable scenes and (a lot of) funny quotes. this here is a genuine mixture of comedy with drama, bringing a movie that will be commented years from now. a serious oscar contender, everything is illuminated is a powerful, original, and, why not say, illuminated movie. but there's one thing you should remember while entering the movie: leave normal behind. this is special.------9/10
