this is not "direct cin'ema", as a matter of fact it is its opposite. second installment of filmmaker gatlif's gypsy trilogy, this french work produced by mich`ele ray-gavras, is a film masterpiece, not pure documentary, no fiction by any means. instead, gatlif has chosen different locations of the route from india to spain, wherever the rom people have a strong presence, and with the help of art directors he has staged several musical numbers that tell us how the gypsies live, sing, dance, struggle and have survived. the movie may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the rom tribe is of indian origin, mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the hebrews (so, in a way, it comes as no surprise that they were also persecuted by the nazis.) but above any anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing.
