you know those films that are blatantly awful but you can't help but love them? well that's what evil ed is, possibly the best awful film in the world. the sound is rubbish, the dubbing is crap, the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are pap. however, i can't help but love this film dearly and i have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. sam campbell (or the guy who plays him) should be featured on the actor's studio series as he is that memorable. possibly the greatest movie villain not named tony montana. seriously, if you don't expect a lot then you won't be disappointed. keep a light-hearted approach to watching this film and you'll soon rate it a ten afterwards.
