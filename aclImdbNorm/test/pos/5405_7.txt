"imaginary heroes" is a 2004 film starring sigourney weaver, jeff daniels, emile hirsch, michelle williams, and kip pardue.<br /><br />the story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child (pardue) commits suicide.<br /><br />"ordinary people" has been mentioned often in relation to this film; it's sort of "ordinary people" with a role reversal. the mother in this case, sandy travis (weaver) is more accessible than the father, ben (daniels) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. like "ordinary people," the younger son tim (hirsch) is the focus of the film.<br /><br />for me, the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it. there were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (williams) and some good offbeat moments. what never clicked was ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with sandy. this seems to have been the goal of director/writer dan harris. in one scene in a grocery store, the checkout kid assumes sandy is "about 30" and gives her his phone number. in almost the next scene, daniels asks sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. weaver was 55 when this film was made, actually probably 54, and looks phenomenal. so what is ben looking at? however, there's something askew about ben's complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how daniels ever was attached to that family.<br /><br />the end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes. everyone is very good, with weaver and hirsch being the standouts.<br /><br />there's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares. the script could have been sharper. but "imaginary heroes" is a good effort.
