from a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. this is the second bruce willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (i refer of course to the sixth sense.) both movies are engaging on more than one level. this one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick for kids. <br /><br />i was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old. also, why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if as his older self says, he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time, and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process. i also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage. <br /><br />good use of the red plane as metaphor, however.
