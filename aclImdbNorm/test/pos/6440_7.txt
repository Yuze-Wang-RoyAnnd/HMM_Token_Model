in 1850 in yorkshire, a boy chimney-sweep is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away. he falls into a treacherous local river and is transported into an underwater realm, where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical water babies from an evil shark.<br /><br />based on a book by charles kingsley, this is a lovely children's film, half live-action and half animation, which is both a grim and evocative depiction of victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable undersea adventure. it really is two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. the animation by tony cuthbert, jack stokes and miroslaw kijowicz is wonderful, as is the photography by ted scaife and the music by phil coulter and bill martin. pender has a great rough-diamond quality as the (literal) fish out of water - i love the moment when he's on top of the mansion, sees all the chimneys and shouts "blimey !!" at the top of his voice. mason and cribbins are the filthiest, nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see real victorian values, don't watch sense and sensibility, watch this), and whitelaw, pertwee (who does umpteen voices) and percival are all excellent. this is how a good children's movie should be - good old singalong fun, but also just a little bit thoughtful, sad and frightening. high cockallorum !!
