the two new oss 117 movies has a kind of humor which is both intelligent and dumbed-down at the same time, which i find extremely amusing. it really reminds me of the classic pink panther movies with an almost as good leading man as peter sellers in jean dujardin. and unlike steve martin completely ruining clouseau, dujardin is quite brilliant.<br /><br />the comments regarding the movies' being anti-semitic, are obviously a case of a complete lack of humor and therefor understanding.<br /><br />whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have. i can't wait for the sequel!
