if you watch this series you will get an interesting 10 chapters about a sleeper cell's story and each characters. and more intense with a fbi's infiltrate.<br /><br />nice story, nice characters and performs, but something is wrong (for me, of course). the final is wrong. you wait ten chapters hoping a great final (it doesn't matters if they fulfill its objectives or not) but.. well... i think is not enough. its a small final for a big series. also i hoped more definitions about characters stories.<br /><br />but, i repeat, it's and interesting miniseries. if you don't want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), watch it. i give 7 of 10.
