first of all, i'd like to say i'm just an amateur in commenting movies and that english is not my native language, but that i felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about such movie; possibly as a way to thank and congratulate c. jay cox, the cast and the crew for such a brilliant production.<br /><br />yesterday i watched "latter days" for the first time.<br /><br />at first i thought it might be similar to the movie "priest", which i liked very much for showing a gay priest out of the closet. but "priest", maybe due to its restrict catholic ideological notions, didn't supply my spectator's needs by revealing a profound sad end.<br /><br />"latter days", on the other hand, broke that concept (and some other ones as well, such as the mormon's principles); presenting a tender and cheerful story, leading it to a happy and emotive end, and yet arousing a feeling of god's blessing and hope. a great movie indeed!<br /><br />somehow "latter days" made me feel l.a. as a city of angels. <br /><br />i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes astoundingly beautiful gay love stories!
