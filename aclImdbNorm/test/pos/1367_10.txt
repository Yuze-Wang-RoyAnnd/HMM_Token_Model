story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on halloween night. in all my life i have never seen such a cheesy film, but it is so d**m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting, effects, direction, and script. this is the best movie created for the halloween season since the original halloween. and when they introduce linnea quigley's character for the first time, she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins. goodness they just don't get any better than this. rush and buy this tape right away. 5/10
