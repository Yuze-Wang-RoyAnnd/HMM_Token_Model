i read the book before seeing the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. very true and faithful to the book. sean penn and sarandon are amazing. robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire. he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end.
