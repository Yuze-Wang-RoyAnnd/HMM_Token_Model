i finally managed to see this movie...after so many years of expectancy...<br /><br />i was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say..<br /><br />and my opinion is that this movie it wasn't bad at all,on the contrary it was amazing...<br /><br />i enjoyed every second from it...from the beginning until the end...<br /><br />the actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing...<br /><br />the landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot...and it did charmed me.. also the music was extraordinary and i have nothing<br /><br />to reproach..<br /><br />i think that the plot was very original i don't think that i saw a movie like this...<br /><br />it is a shame that it isn't recognized all over the world..to bad for those who didn't get the chance to see it. i give this movie 10/10
