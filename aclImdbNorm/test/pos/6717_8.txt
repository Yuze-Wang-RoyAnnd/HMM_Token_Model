lifeforce was one of cannon films' biggest flops. it received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director tobe hooper's career in the wake of the spielberg/poltergeist controversy. all of this is unfortunate, because lifeforce is actually a really great movie. it is supremely entertaining, moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over-the-top direction, production, performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen! it must have looked bizarre on paper: the producers of the delta force, the screenwriter of alien, the director of the texas chainsaw massacre, the composer of breakfast at tiffany's, the special effects wizards of star wars... audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness.<br /><br />what more do you want??? we got an alien spaceship full of giant bats! we got a sexy, naked space vampiress sucking out people's souls! we got exploding bodies! we got zombies! we got possession! we got an s&m interrogation! we got the entire city of london on fire! it's dracula meets night of the living dead meets quartermass and the pit meets earthquake. it's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror/sci-fi/comedy/action/disaster/erotic/apocalyptic epic ever unleashed, that is, if there are any other ones out there.<br /><br />try watching this movie while chemically altered. perhaps then you'll understand. a genuinely f***ed up experience, and one of director tobe hooper's most underrated movies. maybe one day, it will find its audience.
