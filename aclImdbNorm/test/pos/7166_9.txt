this was a wonderful little film that truly was creative and fun--something you see all too seldom in movies. the film begins in russia just after the fall of the communist government. as a result, society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone. dirty cities, crime and lack of housing still plague the poor residents of st. petersburg.<br /><br />into this scene of bleakness and uncertainty comes an idealistic music teacher. he is among those without a home and he finally gets a letter from the government that tells him he has a tiny room in a nearby flat. when he arrives, the place is a mess but the people seem friendly enough so they all have a lovely party. in the middle of the night, they are awakened by an old lady walking out of the giant wardrobe in the room (i was half expecting lucy and the other kids from the lion, the witch and the wardrobe to come out, but they didn't). they are too shocked to do anything at first but decide soon to investigate. instead of just being a clothes closet, the wardrobe opens into paris! how the residents of the flat respond to this magical gateway is really intriguing. some, like the music teacher, are thrilled and in awe. most of the others are more pragmatic and are mostly concerned with looting everything from paris before the gateway closes once and for all! these russian thieves are awful people--greedy, coarse and crude but down deep---very deep--are hearts of gold. i like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the brink of capitalism. at first, they run amok grabbing everything they can and only later do they reveal some depth--but mostly they act much like guests on the jerry springer show! the film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing. about the only negative is that due to some harsh language and a nude scene (albeit, a very funny one), this is not a film for kids. this is a real shame, as with some very minor editing, this could have been a great family film.
