the second episode of the new "lost" gives you just what its fans were lacking - a fair amount of riveting action. from the very first scene, you keep seeing brand new features you weren't expecting to encounter. it's the best proof that the series, ingoing its 4th season, is still alive and kicking hard.<br /><br />although the producers don't amaze us with some more flash-forwards this time, the return to flashbacks is more than satisfying, as it brings some shocking facts. the flashbacks introduce a few fresh characters, and the familiar ones turn out to be connected in a surprising way.<br /><br />the fresh characters dominate the whole episode and i can't say it does any harm. their scenario parts and their actors both do extremely well, providing us with a bracing feel - right after the episode, you'll realize that the show really needed people just like that. and here they are.<br /><br />"confirmed dead" is full of gripping action and greatly written dialogues. i'm sure i'll quote the best scenes of the episode for the long time - they're just that good that they remain on the spectator's mind. the episode is entertaining, smart, and perky. you like "lost", you have to watch it. my vote is ten.
