another "oldie but goody" from about the same time as "out of towners" is "cactus flower", with a great cast: goldie hawn, in her first film appearance (pre-facelifts), ingrid bergmann in one of her later ones, and the ever-funny walter matthau. the story is about a dentist who pretends to be married in order to have an excuse for not marrying his girlfriend, leading to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for proof. he cajoles his spinster receptionist (bergman) into taking the role, leading to multiple comic disasters and surprising romantic turns. it's in the same vein as the doris day/rock hunter comedies. fans of those - as i am - will like this movie; if not, don't bother.
