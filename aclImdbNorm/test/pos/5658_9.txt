during ww2 in the philipines, japanese soldiers are starving, dying, growing weak, and becoming more and more insane. a small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, have eventually resorted to cannibalism. this film perfectly portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme conditions. there are a few humorous parts in this movie, but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film. it follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and eventually to death. a very interesting film, showing the death, and the horror, of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.
