there are films that make careers. for george romero, it was night of the living dead; for kevin smith, clerks; for robert rodriguez, el mariachi. add to that list onur tukel's absolutely amazing ding-a-ling-less. flawless film-making, and as assured and as professional as any of the aforementioned movies. i haven't laughed this hard since i saw the full monty. (and, even then, i don't think i laughed quite this hard... so to speak.) tukel's talent is considerable: ding-a-ling-less is so chock full of double entendres that one would have to sit down with a copy of this script and do a line-by-line examination of it to fully appreciate the, uh, breadth and width of it. every shot is beautifully composed (a clear sign of a sure-handed director), and the performances all around are solid (there's none of the over-the-top scenery chewing one might've expected from a film like this). ding-a-ling-less is a film whose time has come.
