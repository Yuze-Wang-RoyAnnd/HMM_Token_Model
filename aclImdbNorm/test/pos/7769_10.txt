love jones is one of the best movies i've experienced. <br /><br />the main element that sticks out to me is the fact that it is very well-directed. i have studied this film in it's entirety - with watching movies more than once, certain things dawn on you subconsciously - the direction of this movie, as well as the writing, is chic, hip, and artful! i am in love with the direction. the scene where larenz tate and nia long are riding the motorcycle through north chicago at night is astonishing. the director of this movie deserved awards for his great job.<br /><br />love jones is a classy and sexy film. it highlights the fact that we can be people who love, who have flaws, who love living, learning, and just being us without the hype. being our natural selves.<br /><br />the poetry is wonderful, but the story line, the dialog, and the scenes really make this movie.<br /><br />this movie deserves to be seen. it is a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch, or, the hopeless romantic (like myself) to sit back and enjoy alone on a friday or saturday night. any day of the week where peace, solitude, and a little entertainment is needed, love jones is what i recommend.
