isabelle huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid, unfriendly and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. privately, she seethes with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is solitary and perverse. she lives with her overbearing mother, who obsessively drives her to become noticed (and so advance in life) as a talented pianist. the key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsession.' these characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death.<br /><br />the piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her. they start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her, which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun.<br /><br />the film ties itself to the female lead. isabelle huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher. she cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses. as a film that is so character driven, you know it would not work half as well, had she acted poorly.<br /><br />this is powerful, intelligently acted, and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel. the camera work also suits the film. there are what i can only think to call, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about. this is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a further testament to the director's mastery.<br /><br />expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film. but, be brave - have the guts to go and see it. this is a very private look into essentially one person's life, but do not expect to be entertained in the hollywood sense....there are no car chases in this film!
