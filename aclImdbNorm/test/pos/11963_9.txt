in the eighties, savage steve holland put out three movies, two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre, absurdist teen comedies. the third "how i got into college" does not measure up to "better off dead" and this one, mainly because of it's lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong (except for a tiny cameo).<br /><br />one crazy summer is an underrated movie, with lots of great characterizations and gags. as i recall, savage steve's movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into children's tv. we could use more movies from the likes of him.
