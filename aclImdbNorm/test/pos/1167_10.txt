sean connery is very good as the great raisuli, lord of the rif and defender of the faithful. this is an adventure movie with arabs, germans and the usmc all coming to grips at one point or another. there is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters. the story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy greek-american businessman was kidnapped by the raisuli in the early 1900s. milius has substituted candace bergen and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping, and this opens the story to a lot of literary license.<br /><br />on the other hand, the movie gives milius the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous (though mostly forgotten) political quotations of the tr era. brian keith (very good as tr) says, "pedecaris alive or the raisuli dead!"; and john huston (also good as sec of state john hay)asks the japanese ambassador at a white house dinner, "you likee knifee, you likee forkee?"
