fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1.<br /><br />at first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. that's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!<br /><br />next thing you know he's in france in a trench. hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.<br /><br />when charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring. this is such a funny part! i can't really describe it, just watch the movie. when charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to 'wake them up'. it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb... while charlie actually rubs his roommate's foot!<br /><br />the movie then turns a bit grim, as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his trench (although it's done in a very funny way) and him personating as a tree to get close to the enemy, saving a friend of his from a death squad.<br /><br />last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house. he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well. to do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something. i love it when charlie is asked something in german and he's like nein nein nein. the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind: ja ja ja! the kaiser gets captured and charlie is the hero... but then he wakes up again in bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream!<br /><br />charlie did one of those 'dream-sequences' before (the bank comes to mind) but who cares, this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way. chaplin also has something to say with this movie (as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world) and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie: 'peace on earth, good will to all mankind.'<br /><br />in short: a charlie classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10.
