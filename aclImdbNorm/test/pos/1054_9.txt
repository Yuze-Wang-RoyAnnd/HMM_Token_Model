i just got this movie for christmas and have already added it to my favorites list. a cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie. who could not love uncle felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food. definite points go to sydney greenstreet for his performance of alexander yardley and also to reginald gardiner who played john sloane, the impossibly boring fiancee. truly a gem to be watched every christmas.
