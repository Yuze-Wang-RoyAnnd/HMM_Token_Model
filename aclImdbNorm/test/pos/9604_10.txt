as you can see i've submitted 2 comments about this show since 1991....and no, itv have still not made it available for general release.<br /><br />however, i recently contacted itv to see if there was any way of getting hold of a copy, and this was their reply.......<br /><br />"unfortunately there are no plans for this programme to be released on dvd/video. you can however, purchase copies from our viewers requests dept. their email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com ".<br /><br />hope you all now get the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again.<br /><br />
