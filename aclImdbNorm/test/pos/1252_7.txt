as a word of explanation, disney's "the kid" has absolutely nothing in common with the charlie chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. what we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at disney can provide.<br /><br /> bruce willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an "image consultant". he degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. you know that he is going to have to change before the final credits.<br /><br /> into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by spencer breslin (disney always finds these kids somewhere). this forces willis to come to grips with his past and well..you know the rest.<br /><br /> appearing as willis' love interest is emily mortimer and lily tomlin as his executive assistant. both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter-action between the willis and breslin characters.<br /><br /> "the kid", though not the greatest of disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling.
