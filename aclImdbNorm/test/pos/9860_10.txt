the museum of the moving image here in new york recently put on a comprehensive retrospective of jacques rivette's films. having fallen in love with his "paris nous appartient", i decided this was not to be missed.<br /><br />largely through extended shots and flexibly structured scenes, the movie depicts two avant-garde theater companies preparing their renditions of aeschylus' "seven against thebes" and "prometheus". additionally, we are shown the directionless day-to-day lives of two individuals distantly connected to the companies: a working class woman named frederique who finds creative ways of hustling men out of their money, and a young man named colin who visits local caf'es posing as a deaf-mute, and plays shrill harmonica at the patrons until they pay him to go away. the first four hours or so are devoted to establishing the characters and their patterns, before a somewhat loose, whimsical plot finally emerges involving a conspiracy and the decoding of clandestine secret letters.<br /><br />the film is largely about life on the fringe of society. the theater companies are a despairing affair, using their elaborate, emotionally draining exercises (which are really something to watch) to distract themselves from the fact that their acts are unlikely ever to be staged or even seen. colin and frederique both have very few friends, who only briefly find any excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them, as they are spurred to find out more about it. the film meditates on the consequences of rejecting normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long shot of colin as he wanders the streets of france shouting poetry to himself. as such, the film has been referred to as an analysis of 1960's counterculture.<br /><br />there is not a frame of the film that is not bursting with energy and vitality. the fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. the camera also becomes an important character in this regard; throughout the movie boom shadows are visible here and there, or other similar errors, yet they seem natural and fit with the flow of the action because the camera is so important a player therein.<br /><br />more than anything for me, the film seems a great example of another way of making movies, a venue for film outside the usual pattern. for me it was a mind-opening experience, even more than "paris nous appartient", though the latter bears many similarities of theme and structure. a must-see for anybody pondering the nature of art.
