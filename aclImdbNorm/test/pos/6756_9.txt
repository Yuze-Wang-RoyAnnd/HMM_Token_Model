words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film.<br /><br />think "toy story". now, think "toy story", circa 1934. now, imagine the animation looks as lifelike, as fluid. think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy, but imagine it as a filme-noire.<br /><br />imagine trying to do something like that back in 1934. somehow, "the mascot" delivers. in a story where toys come to life, and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner, starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected. it's so fluid, you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop-motion animation. <br /><br />comparing "toy story" and "the mascot" is an excercise in futility, plot-wise: while "toy story" is a children's story adults can enjoy, "the mascot" is a dark, chilling story aimed at adults. meaning, no, your kids won't like it. one bit.<br /><br />still, get it if you can. you might be able to find it along "vampyr" in dvd and laserdisc. and prepare to be stunned at what starewicz was able to do back in 1934 with a couple of puppets.
