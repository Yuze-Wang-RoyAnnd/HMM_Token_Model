after a man turns up dead, a soldier becomes the prime suspect. undoubtedly the best film to feature three roberts and all of them are in fine form. young is the cool-headed, pipe-smoking cop investigating the murder, mitchum is the murder suspect's concerned friend, and ryan is a hot-headed soldier with something to hide. grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale. future tarzan barker has a bit part as a soldier. this film touches on anti-semitism, a subject also covered in best picture oscar winner "gentleman's agreement," which was released the same year. it is solidly directed by dmytryk, who creates an effective film noir atmosphere.
