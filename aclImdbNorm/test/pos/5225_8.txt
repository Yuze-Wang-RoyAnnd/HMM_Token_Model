it's quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we've come along in what we expect from movies, and at the same time appreciate how many bedrock notions were established.<br /><br />here we have a full-fledged narrative talking film - the audio and the visuals are pushed to their period limits. the framing is limited to about belt-high and up -- no face close-ups. <br /><br />the compositions are remarkable; there's an early over-the-shoulder cross cutting scene to showcase the dialogue; there's a treacherous descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles; a sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs march in the upper portion of the frame; the tension in the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by filming above the long axis of a large tree that lies between them; and on and on - early visual treats abound.<br /><br />today, it's unsettling to see the young wayne carry a film, unencumbered by ego or mannerisms.<br /><br />i have to wonder if walsh recognized the self-reference: the subject is the journey of a disparate group of pilgrims; those who appear on screen are a disparate group of stage actors, vaudeville comedians, shell game artists, and, probably, carny barkers and ten-in-one show veterans. they all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be made.<br /><br />this is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies.
