i have seen films come and go in my years,and when i see a disaster film i keep hoping i wont be disappointed.and with this one i was not in the least.the story of a whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by sakyo komatsu,a novelist with intense theories on where this earth is going.the characters were top notch,and even though i am not japanese,i didn't need a translator to give the idea of how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common good.the special effects blew me away,i was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tidal waves lava flows and land explosions that must have taken months of work to perfect.as for the acting i thought yes,this is acting at its best,emotions run rampant throughout the film and i cried at the most severe scenes.for movie goers alike,you don't need to speak or understand japanese to watch this film,you can get the idea and feeling from each person and character to understand it well and to follow it along like you are there.my hats off to shinji higuchi for directing it,i hope he can outdo his work with another mind blowing experience.as i said,....fantastic film.
