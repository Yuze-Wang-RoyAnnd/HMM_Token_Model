"my wife and kids," in my opinion, is an absolute abc classic! i haven't seen every episode, but i still enjoyed it. there are many episodes that i enjoyed. one of them was where junior (george o. gore ii) got his driver's license. if you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.
