the sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be. and it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy.<br /><br />this is not a movie that will win an academy award. but it does take what made the jackass tv show and original movie a success, and it turns it up a notch. it is funnier, more brutal, and more disgusting than the original. and i loved every minute of it.<br /><br />the original had a few notorious stunts, and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for. you will wince, cringe, look away, and laugh very, very hard.<br /><br />in any event, you probably do not need to read this review, or any others, to know if you will like this movie, unless you have never heard of jackass.
