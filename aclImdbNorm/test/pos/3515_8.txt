i didn't have very high expectations about just before dawn. i don't know why i keep buying these slasher movies when i know it's all the same every time. maybe i'm a bit masochistic? anyway, i'm glad i bought this one. yes, it's all the same. no, it has nothing original. yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. and you know what? it's just magic! it's one of the best experiences i had watching a slasher movie. the places where it's shot are so wonderful. you see mountains, waterfalls, rockies. it's just amazing. it takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but i didn't care! it was enjoyable to watch enough not to care. what i mean is, you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself. the ending is a bit weird, but i won't tell you anything more about it. you'll know what i mean. another thing i enjoyed: you care about the characters. they're not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other. sure, they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but, there's something special about them. anyway, it's a great horror movie and i hope you have a pretty good time watching it because i really did!
