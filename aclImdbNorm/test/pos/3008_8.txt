i give this film 8/10 overall. visually, a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning: an art director's dream mix of hieryonomous bosch, salvador dali, frieda kahlo and georgia o'keeffe--and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form. beautiful use of color, form, imagery, environment--and fabulous set decoration, combine with state-of-the-art computer graphics. so, 10/10 for that! wow!<br /><br />the plot line is, well, more predictable. you know they'll save the girl and get the killer in the end, but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there. 6/10 for that.<br /><br />squirm factor...i won't give this a rating, but the film certainly made me squirm, and i was watching it on video on a tv screen. it would, of course, have a great deal more impact on a big screen. graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surreal landscape--even if beautiful--is highly unpredictable. the world inside the killer's head is not--thank goodness!--my world. because i watched this film on video, i was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when i wasn't so nervous about where the scene might be going, and i suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time, just for the "visual art".<br /><br />general suggestion: don't take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one, but if you're keen on the visual look of films, like surrealist art, don't mind a bit of kinky gore, and just want to take a bit of a "mind trip", this one's a winner. oh, and if you're keen on babes, jennifer lopez is pretty hot.<br /><br />
