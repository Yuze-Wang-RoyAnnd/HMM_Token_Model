this is an entertaining surreal road movie. it was written by joseph minion, who also wrote after hours, martin scorsese's excellent surreal film. the film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old kid named gus, who drives a red ford mustang across some fictional states with names like tristana (a tribute to luis bu~nuel's film, perhaps?), essex & south lyndon, in search of eight elusive motorama game cards from various chimera company gas stations. the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual, like the money for instance, which is like blank paper with numbers on.<br /><br />most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip. they tattoo him, punch him, but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest. some oddball actors like david lynch incumbent jack nance, meat loaf & flea also make appearances. jack nance plays a motel owner, who when he first meets gus tells him, "if you see any squirrels, give them to me". this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus $100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely. if you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies, you'll like this. an odd little gem of a movie.
