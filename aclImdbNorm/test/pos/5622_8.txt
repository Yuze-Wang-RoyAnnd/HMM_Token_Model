chris smith is a superior filmmaker with the seldom-seen talent for spotting a good story, then getting the hell out of its way. smith's "american movie" is the true-to-life record of filmmaker wannabe mark borchardt, a loser intent on milking his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror short. but never, under any circumstances, to pursue gainful employment or support the children he's conceived.<br /><br />such is producer smith's skill that mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise. even as he entices uncle bill with sugar-spun dreams and executive producer credits, it is his desperation to be somebody, to have his name coupled with the likes of scorsese and spielberg that touches us.<br /><br />"american movie" also belongs in that rare, often attempted but seldom achieved sub genre that successfully blends hilarity with horror. the humor comes from borchardt's ed wood-style belief in his own genius. from his appalling attempts at acting, from his substituting his less than film-savvy mother for a missing cameraman and from his employing sweet but brain-damaged friend mike whenever he's short an actor or crew member.<br /><br />the horror comes from seeing what borchardt cannot: it is this very american attitude--i want, therefore i am entitled--that keeps him from seeing just how much he has to learn about his chosen craft. he is so confident he can't fail that failure is guaranteed.
