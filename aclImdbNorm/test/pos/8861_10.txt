many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. my movie will always be john carpenter's the thing! the main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius rob bottin and that this is the movie that made kurt russell what he is today (along with escape from n.y.) in my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. i have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great "das boot".<br /><br />here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: place yourself in the good chair of your home. be sure you're not interupted by anyone. if you aint got a projector, sit close to your tv and watch this miracle of a film. let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way!<br /><br />best view time: late february between 5 and 9 in the evening.
