chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. the rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. he's in france for one thing: to fight the germans, something he does with unbelievable success.<br /><br />it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.<br /><br />perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.
