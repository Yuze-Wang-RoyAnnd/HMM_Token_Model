caught this film on tcm in the early a.m. it was amazing.<br /><br />starting out slow but ominously.... scott is a shady character who preys on women. in this case, two women who happen to be due an inheritance in southern california.<br /><br />the sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940's are original and intriguing. the title may have been more creative, but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a hitchcockian version.<br /><br />scott reminded me of the character uncle charley in "shadow of a doubt", one of hitch's reputed favorite films. the audience learns,we truly do not know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind.this film is a displaced gem and well-worth purchasing. 10/10.
