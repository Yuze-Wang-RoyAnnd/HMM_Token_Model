for me, north and south (books i&ii) is the ultimate tv series of the 80's. just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining.gene kelly, james stewart, elisabeth taylor, olivia de havilland, robert mitchum, even johny cash! no series has come close to this achievement.have you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln? dick smith's prosthetics made hal holbrock's powerful performance even more so. the crafted costumes, the jaw dropping locations, everything. it's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series (desperate housewives, lost,24) but north & south was, and still is, one of its kind. don't miss it. only david carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain (you may call him just violent husband) worths the viewing. maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped, i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them. i'm so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain.
