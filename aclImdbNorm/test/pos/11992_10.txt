like richard pryor, mason never got the material he deserved. whatever you know of him is probably wrong. get past the accent and go see his stand-up. you'll be very surprised -- he's one of the best stand-ups i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from lenny bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock -- jackie mason is definitely up there). he's known for being a comic's comic. even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.<br /><br />the accussation that mason is no dangerfield is ridiculous. dangerfield is known for having been a huge mason fan. dangerfield's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following mason's shows. that is when mason provided dangerfield with inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. while i think dangerfield is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see mason is the better comedian.
