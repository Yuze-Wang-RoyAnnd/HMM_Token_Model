the 13th and last rko falcon film starts with the mutual injunction by tom conway as tom lawrence alias the falcon and ed brophy as goldie of "no dames!" whilst they prepare to go on vacation. while you're still wondering what they're going on vacation from as they hadn't had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 (with sanders as gay though and jenkins as goldie) they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caper.<br /><br />they promise to help her when her uncle is murdered, by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in miami. suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after lawrence
