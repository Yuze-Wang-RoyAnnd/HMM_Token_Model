what can i say? i got up this morning and turned on sci-fi and watched half of the first season and figured it all out. strange, unusual, and brilliant. it gives all potential, and to think at first i said this looks stupid. this has got to be the next best thing since x-files, but as always nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion. i am telling you, it's scary and then suspenseful and then mellow. towards the end you have miles as a love puppy with a weird pet that is a new species. you have two people on the run from authorities. and a killer tsunami about to strike! wow! and did i mention miles pet is a potential killer(well the rest of his species is). surface is a brilliant show with spins and twists that delivers it all.
