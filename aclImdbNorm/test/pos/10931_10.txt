i have just read what i believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical irishman. lovely to read.<br /><br />however, a concise analysis of this film is that it is a interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice.<br /><br />envy, greed, pride, sloth, anger, etc. and justice in the forms of retributive, distributive, blind, and divine.<br /><br />i could demonstrate three examples of each, one for each of the three protagonists; however, it is much more fun to note them for oneself.<br /><br />this is an excellent film.<br /><br />don't miss it.
