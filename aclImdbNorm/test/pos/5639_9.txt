okay, so i'm a sucker for a good documentary, particularly where it tells a modern-day don quixote story. a caveat: i met mark borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while he was still working on coven. but i'll save that story for later. american movie, which commenced production not long after, accurately portrays the person that i knew, although in greater depth than i expected or believed existed. this is simultaneously a very funny and very sad film, and is brilliantly executed. mark comes across as his own worse enemy: his childlike ambition and optimism -- which i admire -- is undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations. but he's also a charismatic guy. his loyal sancho panza sidekick is equally likeable: loyal, if frazzled, to the core. like don quixote, american movie presents an often-ignored inefficient aspect of freedom -- that people will be drawn toward professions to which they are not particularly well-suited, irrespective of repeated failure. it is a great film.
