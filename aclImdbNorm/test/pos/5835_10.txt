harrowing series about life in oz--an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate prisoners. there's gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, killings, humiliation, tons of male nudity...all in your face and going full force.<br /><br />it also is easily one of the best written dramas ever put on tv and almost all the actors are just great. since this was on cable there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. there's plenty of racist comments flying in here but it's for all races. in fact the white characters come off pretty badly (especially the aryans) and the black characters come off better (the peace-loving muslims). the hispanics don't have a strong role and there are no asian prisoners at all. all the prisoners seem to be back-stabbers and willing to kill anyone at a moments notice---but you still find yourself sympathizing with some of them. even the guards, counselors and doctors at the prison have serious issues.<br /><br />i heartily recommend this but rent it--don't buy it. i have the whole collection and, to be totally honest, i don't think i ever want to see it again. it's incredible tv but so grim, dark and depressing. guess i gotta sell it all online.<br /><br />i give it a 10.
