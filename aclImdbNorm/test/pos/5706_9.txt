when i tuned in to my local pbs station last night to watch "the war that made america". i was expecting a dull documentary, instead i got a very good and believable reenactment of the major events of the time. now i see the reasons for the american revolution, and the part the indian wars played. larry nehring is george washington, and he is perfect for that part. the narrative to the camera, also work fantastic. i'm looking forward to next week, to see the rest. it's good to see pbs really using the hd format to bring the 1700 right in to our living room.<br /><br />i hope larry nehring is seen more in the future, since he is such a talented actor.
