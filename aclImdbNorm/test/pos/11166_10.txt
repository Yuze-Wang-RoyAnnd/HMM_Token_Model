great movie about a great man. thomas kretschmann is first rate as in all of his other movies.i would never have envisioned him as pope john paul. it speaks volumes for the casting director. why do they keep casting him as german officer in the movies? and he only came to universal attention after "the pianist"? of course he looks so hot in the uniforms. i know a lot of girls drool over his handsome face. but this guy is a great actor and has such great potentials. if you don't believe me, go watch "stalingrad". i hope he will get a lot of excellent roles in the future with more diversity. otherwise, what a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
