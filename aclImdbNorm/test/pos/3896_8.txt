william h. macy always gives a good performance. he never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. in short, he's what more actors should be like. "a slight case of murder" is directed by steven schachter, who went on to do two more great films with macy (door to door, the wool cap).<br /><br />television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. that's why it's so refreshing to see a tv movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for. to tell a small story (not a simplistic story) that does not require viewing on the big screen.<br /><br />"a slight case of murder" is light, entertaining fare, and an great watch.<br /><br />7.6 out of 10
