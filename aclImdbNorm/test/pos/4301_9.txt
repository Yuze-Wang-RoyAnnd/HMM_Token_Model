this was one of the worst columbo episodes that i have seen, however, i am only in the second season.<br /><br />the typical columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. his cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, and the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,tho the scene on the tv cooking show distracted from the main theme.<br /><br />also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. the reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose. but the part i disliked the most was the death of the bride to be . this was never explained and it is the main reason why i give this episode such a low grade.
