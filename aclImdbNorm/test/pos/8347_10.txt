lady and the tramp ii: scamp's adventure is a cool movie that many kids today can really relate to. it's a well-presented story about a kid who longs for the freedom to do things his way, and how he goes about getting this freedom is only a part of what makes this film interesting. just forget the itty-bitty disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a pup's point of view, because that's just 0.5% or less of the movie's wonderful effect on the viewer. great music, lively acting, talented animation and directing, and a powerful storyline tell a tale of the difference between freedom on the streets of new england and a cozy home with your family. and that no matter how bad things seem, your family and friends are "always there" to help you though any tight spot.<br /><br />i can't wait to get the soundtrack!
