i bought this a while back, during a massive martial arts movie phase. although this certainly ain't the best, i do love this kind of film making, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. leung kar yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, i always appreciate the fact that, whilst he lacked formal martial arts training, he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. he also has a good beard. this movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies, he still acquits himself well. early appearances from cherie chung and chow yun fat are also nice too see, especially for the fact that chow yun fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. he may not be a great fighter but he does ok. eddy ko is as great a bad guy as ever, he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great, as per usual. the fellow who plays bu is good too, i don't recall his name, but he's in magnificent butcher too. although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era, the postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. there are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mixture of hong kong talents all coming together to decent effect. all in all, i would recommend this to kung fu and general hong kong action fans. it may not be a stylised classic like the shaw brothers films, or as crowd pleasing as jackie chan or bruce lee, but it is rock solid entertainment.
