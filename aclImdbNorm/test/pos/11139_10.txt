great job! was very exciting and had great stunts. a show that really rocked. was a great job by all who worked on this one; and especially the acting on bobbie phillips' part. this would have been great on the big screen. would like to see more of these movies of the week or perhaps a weekly series. this was great entertainment and am glad i watched! by far the best of the three. keep up the good work upn and bobbie phillips. i'll be looking for the next one.
