a fairly enjoyable kidnapping caper set in new orleans, but its main downfall in my opinion is that it packs way too much political intrigue and double-crossing, and not enough of the sexy young actors, scenes of vibrant colour, original cinematographical style and biting humour. these aspects combine to give refreshingly daring cinema, which makes a whole bunch of recent stuff look unbearably dull. let's hope s'ebastian gutierrez continues with such flair - he looks like a talent to watch out for. the mismatched bunch of small-time crooks in the film are outshadowed by the investigative partnership of emma thompson and alan rickman, the humour of whose scenes is much needed in making the movie what it is. the pair pull off their obligatory southern drawls just as well as the yanks, and it's a delight to hear these two stalwarts of british cinema yapping away to each other with lethal-weapon-style fluidity...just a pity that the only scenes they have the opportunity to steal are exclusively theirs. anyway, with a bit less politics and authoritarianism (!), the film would be near-perfect, so i'll give it a healthy 8/10 and hope that a few people remember it a bit better than the box-office did.
