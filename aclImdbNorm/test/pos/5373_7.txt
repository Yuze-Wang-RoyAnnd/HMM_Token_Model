a family is traveling through the mid west. there's widower ben (charles bateman), his girlfriend nicky (ahna capri) and ben's little daughter k.t. (geri reischl). then hit a town named hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely. their car breaks down and they're forced to stay. they soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil.<br /><br />the story is not that good. people just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end. also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end. the acting is pretty poor too. bateman and capri are bland and everybody else is about the same. only old pros strother martin and l.q. jones give good performances. still this movie does work. it forgoes blood and gore (there's some but this is pg) and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere. the acting hampers a lot of it but it still works. martin especially chews the scenery in his role. i can't explain exactly why i (sort of) like this movie but it did work on me. it's a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore. hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered. a 7.
