i seriously enjoy dr who.<br /><br />seriously, don't just dismiss me as a "sci-fi person", because i'm not normally. i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it. it is actually really funny, and more often than not, it's fast-paced. all of my family watch it pretty much and that's a miracle.<br /><br />christopher ecclestion is pretty good, but david tennant is brilliant. i think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a tv character again.<br /><br />i don't know what it is about it, but everything manages to work like clockwork. <br /><br />all i'm going to say is just try it. one episode (probably best if you don't pick the second half of a two-parter, though).
