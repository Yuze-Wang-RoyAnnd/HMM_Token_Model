for the record, the 1949 version of "the blue lagoon" is not the original film, as many have stated.<br /><br />this story was filmed in great britain, in 1923, just after the novel was written. as much as i'd love to see the 1949 version, i'd thoroughly enjoy an opportunity at seeing the true original release of this story on film.<br /><br />granted, the 1980 film with christopher atkins, brooke shields, and the two youngsters was filmed with beautiful cinematography. the acting didn't seem all that great when i first viewed this film, but after having viewed this a few times.... it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without adult guidance, would indeed have a simplistic way of approaching life.... whether it be in their language, appearance, or daily activities.<br /><br />although some have been fortunate enough to view the 1949 "blue lagoon", i cannot help but wonder if there is anyone living who can remember the 1923 release of this story to film.
