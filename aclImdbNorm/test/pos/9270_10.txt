there are so many episodes that make me howl over the stories<br /><br />that i wish i could pick the best ones , rocko and bill make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and bs their way out of hard time just to drag dan into their life of crime .<br /><br />canadians will notice the odd joke for toronto or the federal government, and because the cbc axed a really good show by the frantics that dan was part of , the show takes shots at them and in the episode "dan's umbrella" the cbc is raked across the coals .<br /><br />when dan says that the cbc would never waste taxpayers money on useless venture , rocko enters the room and gives dan back his tape of friday-night with ralph benmurgue , this show was a flop and most people wouldn't get the joke unless they knew the cbc's history for making shows people don't watch or axing good shows that they do watch.
