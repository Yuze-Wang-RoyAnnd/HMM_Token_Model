first off, to rent or watch this film you are expecting something in the b-horror range. what this film delivers for the astute fan of this genre is quite a hilarious romp via nordic flavor. at times reminding me of the humor of jackson's dead alive and others of a stuart gordon flick this little find should have most chuckling throughout. <br /><br />the f/x reach a few highs of truly spooky (the first time ed meets his nemesis) but generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f/x team that decided to use any and all props at their disposal from other films...gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc. to pretty good effect and worked in thru the use of hallucinations. <br /><br />the gem of the film is the humor. the gore works most of the time but more for laughs. at its heart its a parody and a fun one at that.
