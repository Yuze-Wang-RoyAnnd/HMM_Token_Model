the success of scream gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. i'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and i liked most of those new horror films. boc is a one big pack of horror. colorful, fast paced and original. i see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like episode 1 and aliens: resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. we have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers. very inventive!
