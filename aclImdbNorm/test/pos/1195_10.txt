milos forman's original hair was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life was changing in those years, not only in the usa, but especially in this country. one of the plots in the film was to be used in other films to come after hair, for example, in american graffitti, etc. it was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it. the characters in the film were like lonely "cells" in a "body" that was changing all over. overall, a very good film, perhaps a little underrated though. annie golden's role was minor but she acted very well. it was the film that practically launched john savage as an actor. one of the members of the chicago played his role well even though it was a minor role.
