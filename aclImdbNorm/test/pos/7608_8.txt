of course, really experienced reviewers who like stuff like star wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments about it. but really, it is enjoyable teen comedy with an awesome story and good acting.<br /><br />josie gellar (played well by drew barrymore) is part of a news-reporting team and she has been offered a ('real') job - she has to go back to school and find out what teens are like these days. well this goes alright, until josie remembers her horrible time at high school and gets freaked out. but she's never been hip, never been cool, never been popular until now!<br /><br />sit back relax and enjoy with never been kissed!<br /><br />
