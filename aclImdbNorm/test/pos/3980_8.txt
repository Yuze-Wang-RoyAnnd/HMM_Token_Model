this is what movies should aspire to. funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. i've been seeing justin long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, i figured with the right role he could break out. (mac commercials not withstanding.) this film just might put him on a fast track to the a list. the rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message. (but you don't need to buy the message to have a good time.) lewis black is, as usual, hilarious, and blake lively is a fresh faced beauty. <br /><br />take a couple hours and see this film, they will not have been wasted.
