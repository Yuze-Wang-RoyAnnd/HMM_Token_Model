what's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... here is my forecast: 1. the hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. buts lets see about that. 2. the episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on desmonds boat by penny. now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3. after the destruction of the hatch, the island is not isolated any more, and other ships/airplanes are going to arrive 4. the others are finally going to share their secret with us poor observers<br /><br />was it actually confirmed that there are going to be 4 seasons of lost?<br /><br />cheers mike
