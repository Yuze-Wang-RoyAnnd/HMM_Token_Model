there are many things to admire about this film, but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse, the sort of role that hollywood loves & romanticizes but which here is absolutely convincing & unlike any character i've encounterd in film or in life. also a very convincing & disturbing depiction of tourete's syndrome
