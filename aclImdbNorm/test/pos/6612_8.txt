i saw this movie on the lowlands festival (23, 24, 25th of august) after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating. i didn't now what to expect from this movie. was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks, or was it a documentary about skating.<br /><br />so i went in, after waiting for about an hour, whit out any expectations.<br /><br />this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding. it started with the zephyr team, who where a fine group of surfers. this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in. at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on. so they try something else. skateboarding was a fact. <br /><br />if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time, you where one of the cool guys/girls. because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team. so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard. <br /><br />in no time skateboarding was popular again. there were a couple of competitions and one national competition. the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one. but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable. but the jury didn't now how to judge them. so they put the whole skateboarding world on it's head.<br /><br />anyway i can tell you the rest of the film/documentary, but you must see this one with you're own eyes. because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. this movie got a lot of style for me, so i rewarded it with a 8.<br /><br />greetings from gijs and the rest of holland. see you.
