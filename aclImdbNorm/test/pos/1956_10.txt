i really don't have any complaints about this movie, except for the disturbing scenes with the body. i fell upon it while switching around the tv one night. the acting was actually amazing, i didn't expect it to be better than it appeared! i thought keanu's(who looks the same since 1986, which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really *great*, and crispin played his character perfectly! this movie is a hidden gem! its a fresh awaking of reality to the '80s, compared to the other teen movies done by the brat pack(even though i do like those moives alot too). all in all, i give it thumbs up!
