the premise of the story is common enough; average family wants out of the rat race; wants to find the simple life....so they move from sherman oaks,california to lake tomahawk; kids in tow.<br /><br />the lake is beautiful, they have leased an old house....but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how (never mind why). gerald mcraney is excellent, a familiar face for lifetime viewers; valerie harper is also good; since this film was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.<br /><br />you will also enjoy barry corbin as the town eccentric, and darryl anderson as a bruce dern-lookalike/crazed military man.<br /><br />while the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from ""psycho""; ""deliverance""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu.<br /><br />sit back and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining; and better than, for example the more recent movie:<br /><br />""i know what you did last summer""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!.
