cult film-maker corbucci's rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns (of which i'm only left with what am i doing in the middle of the revolution [1972] to catch) is one i only became aware of fairly recently via marco giusti's "stracult" guide; it's an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece, the great silence (1968), complete with desolate snowy landscapes.<br /><br />johnny hallyday, the french elvis presley, whom i first saw in jean-luc godard's detective (1985) is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti-hero hud (who, like clint eastwood's the man with no name from sergio leone's celebrated "dollars trilogy", is fitted with a steel-plate armor for protection); incidentally, i had 'met' hallyday's stunning daughter laura smet at the 2004 venice film festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director, claude chabrol! gastone moschin is another curious addition to the fold (serving pretty much the same function that frank wolff did in the great silence) but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing francoise fabian; the latter, then, plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker's widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals. sylvie fennec has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by hallyday and who, at one point, is entreated into free love by 'hippie' apache gabriella tavernese (with this is mind, it's worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both fabian and tavernese)! incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long-haired youths (who also engage in dope-smoking and revolutionary talk) is a somewhat half-baked attempt at contemporary relevance
