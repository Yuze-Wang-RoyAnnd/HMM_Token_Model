not your ordinary movie, but a good one. billy bob is very funny in this movie, the way he talks, what he says etc. i was kind of surprised when i saw it, cause i just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. it had a very good story, great characters and a good balance.<br /><br />favorite part: probably when billy bob is running around in his robe shooting at the rippers
