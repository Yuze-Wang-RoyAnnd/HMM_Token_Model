one of fuller's (a combat veteran himself) early works of average quality, but accurately hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar germany. the main character starts the movie in apr'45 as a sgt with c co, 157th inf, 45th div, which really did end the war in munich as in the movie. (same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in aschaffenburg and then liberated part of the dachau facility). to the uninformed the movie may seem confusing by flip flopping between showing the good & bad of the german people. but anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45-47 germany. the only inaccuracy i noticed was minor: while on a boat cruise of the rhine passing the remains of the remagen bridge he comments he crossed there. but his unit really crossed well south of there - north of worms germany.
