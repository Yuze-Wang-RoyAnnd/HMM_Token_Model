a group of teens decide to take their slumber party to an abandoned school where, 27 years prior, a horrible massacre took place. unfortunately for them, the person responsible for the slaughter still lurks the halls of the derelict school and he is not happy with their presence.<br /><br />this film is not like most modern teen slashers we've seen. it's much darker, much more suspenseful, no wise-cracking murderer, etc., and i liked it for those reasons. from a film-making point-of-view, it's not great. the acting is below average. the writing was pretty bad and quite full of clich'es, containing randomly tossed-in references to american horror films, some that didn't even make sense (like. . . "have you seen scream 3?", a girl asks. yes, i have, and it had nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school so it in no way relates to this film). but, hey, it's a slasher flick, those are part of the fun. also, the underutilization of characters was heavily exhibited in this film. there were six main characters (not including the security guard) and, to be honest, only three or four were really used. two characters (the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label) barely spoke: between them, i'd estimate about five or six lines total. also, the girls (other than one) weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another. they could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldn't have noticed the difference. the pacing, however, works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases. the atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments. . . although, the overall appearance is a bit cheap-looking due to, what i assume is, low-grade camera equipment (and operation). the ending, though i liked the idea they were going for, was fairly poorly done. it felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective. with the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing, they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason (which is a flaw many modern horror films are afflicted with). however, ignoring a few irksome issues and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film rather than the ending, this is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked out, especially if you're a fan of spanish and/or atmospheric horror.<br /><br />obligatory slasher elements:<br /><br />- violence/gore: there's a good bit of blood and gore, realistically done, but not buckets. the violence is extremely well done, not to excess, but pretty brutal at points.<br /><br />- sex/nudity: little bit, and with the hottest girl in the film.<br /><br />- cool killer: well, security guards are hardly considered 'cool,' but this guy is pretty wicked. his creepy smile was chilling.<br /><br />- scares/suspense: the suspense is top-notch. . . very tense, very well done. there are also some extremely creepy moments that fused jump scares and the spooky atmosphere.<br /><br />- mystery: none at all, really.<br /><br />- awkward dance scene: of course: between a couple of guys and a half-unwilling female in the flashback.<br /><br />- classic quote of the film: 'one more trophy.' <br /><br />final verdict: 7/10. this may be stretching it, but fans of session 9 might want to check it out simply for the similar tone and atmosphere.<br /><br />-ap3-
