don't quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic. if it had been realistic, there certainly wouldn't have been much comedy. i also don't think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times. there was much subtle humor, sweet feelings, and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character. in real life, there are many people whose facial expression doesn't change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right. the ending was quite unrealistic, i'd say, but happy. it's a light-hearted movie with a feel-good ending. i liked it. loved it, actually. a serious part was krueger going to schwedt, and i'm glad they didn't show what happened to him there. showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly.
