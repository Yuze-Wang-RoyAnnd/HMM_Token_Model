not being a fan of the coen brothers or george clooney, anyone can see the skepticism i took into the theater. once again, someone in hollywood dares to create something different. this time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) coens doing "their thing" to one of the great works in literary history. who would've ever thought homer had this in mind? i don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others dvd or vhs library. it is one of those films that you can watch over and over. the story is brilliantly written. clean and entertaining, with a couple of gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by clooney, turturro, nelson, and a brief but hilarious holly hunter. being born in mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, i wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. they even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. you are not doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!<br /><br />
