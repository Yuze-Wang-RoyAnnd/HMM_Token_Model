in a genre by itself, this film has a limited audience and narrow appeal coupled with a subtle undertone which permeates the entire production. nevertheless, it is a remarkable piece of cinema which is as timeless as a rare work of art. capturing a time in qu'ebec rarely seen in movies, mon oncle antoine's strength lies in the depth of its characters and the richness of the settings. duplessis' qu'ebec, parochial and feudal, is brilliantly cast as the backdrop which could not possibly be achieved by anyone other than a pure laine qu'ebecois.<br /><br />it would be far too easy to resort to stereotypes, clich'es and single-minded myopic statements in this story. yet the director chose to skip the forced imagery and instead, focused on the essence of life in rural qu'ebec of the time. that makes this film exceptional in its authenticity while not being pretentious in its presentation. if only more contemporary cinematic endeavors would do the same, the viewing public might not be forced to choose between the over-hyped hollywood pablum that passes for 'must see' viewing.<br /><br />mon oncle antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. it will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in - or visited - qu'ebec. a classic. **********************************************<br /><br />follow-up: 10 may 2008<br /><br />after reviewing some of the comments, it's worth noting mon oncle antoine is not - and probably wasn't meant to serve as standard hollywood/american cinema for mass market sales. a coming of age story, yes, but far more than simple memoirs of adolescence in 1940's qu'ebec. viewers who're looking for sheer entertainment at the expense of complex development of the characters will be sorely disappointed. go watch action/adventure/romance/comedies to be amused. watch mon oncle antoine to be drawn into a seldom seen, but absolutely remarkable society that has been overlooked and ignored for far too long.<br /><br />the grapes of wrath is hardly an edge-of-the-seat thriller, yet the story and characters are what makes this american classic an enduring film. mon oncle antoine is in the same genre.
