this movie was one of the best i have ever seen. just the other day i was reminded of this movie by something on tv. it came back to me like a dam flooding over. i have never been more touched by a movie than by this one. after the movie was over i actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours. no movie has ever moved me that way before. i was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping i can find a copy to buy so that i can watch it whenever i want to. if someone suggests you see this movie with them, go....you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />peggy fries
