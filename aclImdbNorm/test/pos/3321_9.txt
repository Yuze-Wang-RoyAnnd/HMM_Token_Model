a classic late 50's film. the superannuated headliners (joan crawford and louis jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. in a 50's sense (which i love).<br /><br />the look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film "far from heaven" reflects exactly this sort of film (and i suspect this film may be one of the models). a silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959!), but as a film-- glorious! as a reflection of the society, extremely interesting. and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual mores, fascinating.
