for those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 birch street is a must see.<br /><br />by training the spotlight on his own family, block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. he explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. in fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. <br /><br />in addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. i don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.<br /><br />highly recommended.
