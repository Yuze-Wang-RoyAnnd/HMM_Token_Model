the first thing i noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. a quality movie all round. <br /><br />i suppose you could love this film just for its action, but i liked it for more than that.<br /><br />this is a pure thriller/horror movie. it offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do. i thought, at least the u.s. version, ended brilliantly, and was great throughout. the story felt honest and brutal.<br /><br />the film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely believable situations.
