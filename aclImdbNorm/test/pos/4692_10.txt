some people don't appreciate the magical elements in ros,but they are what sets this series apart, that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and armour--not anachronistic feathered caps,multi-coloured tights and plate armour!<br /><br />but i am really writing to comment on an earlier poster's article. um, michael praed did not leave ros to do jules verne! there are 15 years between these two series. yup, i agree and michael might well agree too that leaving ros was not a good move--but it was a coveted broadway role that tempted him in '84 and then dynasty with its megabucks paychecks....
