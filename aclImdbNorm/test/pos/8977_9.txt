i quit watching "the west wing" after aaron sorkin quit writing and producing. it just wasn't the same. imagine my thrill at seeing a film that he wrote again. it has been a long time - the american president, a few good men. his script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. he made a compelling story believable, and made me weep at the same time.<br /><br />tom hanks was incredible as a small-time texas congressman whose constituents only wanted lower taxes and to keep their guns. not a hard job, so he had plenty of time to fool around - and that he did. his office staff looked as if he were at the playboy mansion. like he reportedly said, "you can teach them to type, but you can't teach them to grow tits." despite his sexist attitude, which fits right in with a texas congressman, they were fiercely loyal, especially his aide, amy adams (junebug & former hooters girl).<br /><br />now, add a rich texas socialite who wants something done in afghanistan, played perfectly by julia roberts; and a pain-in-his-boss's-ass cia agent, superbly done by philip seymour hoffman, and you have a movie well worth watching.<br /><br />outstanding writing, and superlative acting, and a story that needed to be told. what more do you want at the movies?
