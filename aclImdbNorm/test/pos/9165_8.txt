the italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual "the courtier." the film "hitch" is worth watching for the embodiment of the "sprezzzatura" concept in the dynamic performance of will smith.<br /><br />smith plays the character of alex "hitch" hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and confidence. the best scenes are when hitch coaches the painfully shy and maladroit albert in his quest to win the heart of a new york socialite and in hitch's own attraction to sara and a surprise for her when visiting ellis island. in these scenes, smith is supported with good work from kevin james and eva mendes. but this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of smith.<br /><br />from start to finish, smith rises above the average comic script to make "hitch" an eminently watchable and entertaining film. i do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like will smith in this film. and his secret is in the "sprezzatura"!
