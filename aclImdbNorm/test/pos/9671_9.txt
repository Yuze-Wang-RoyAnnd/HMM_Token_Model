seth mcfarlane is a true genius. he has crafted a show that is witty, culturally sharp and just downright hilarious.<br /><br />for those that think its 'offensive' take on social or cultural topics makes no meaningful comment, just causes 'offence', can be pointed to this quote:<br /><br />peter (coming out of the stem cell lab): how long was i in there? // guard: five minutes. // peter: why aren't we funding this?!?<br /><br />why indeed.<br /><br />thanks family guy, for being not only the funniest show on tv (with the possible exception of the much loved, much missed futurama), but for also being pretty clever to boot.
