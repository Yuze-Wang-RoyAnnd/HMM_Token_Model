this film screened at the american cinematheque's egyptian theatre in hollywood on april 7, 1999. it was described in the american cinematheque schedule as follows:<br /><br />"tomorrow is another day 1951, warners, 90 min. steve cochran's an ex-con who's never been with a woman. ruth roman is a dime-a-dance dame with no use for sappy men. a hotel room, a dirty cop, a gunshot - the perfect jump-off for a fugitives-on-the-run love story. this virtually unknown noir is felix feist's masterwork, packed with revelatory set-pieces. cochran was never more vulnerable, roman never sexier. imagine gun crazy scripted by steinbeck - it's that good."<br /><br />i just saw this film, and i agree with every word of the above description.
