this movie was an excellent acted, excellent directed and overall had an excellent story. ive had real life experiance with a boy like 'radio'. at the football program in my town, weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice, travel, and have fun with the football team. this movie is really true and i can identify with it 100%. a boy like 'radio' just needs to feel like they belong to something; they need to feel like their life is worth living. thats how 'radio' feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school. this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen. my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man!
