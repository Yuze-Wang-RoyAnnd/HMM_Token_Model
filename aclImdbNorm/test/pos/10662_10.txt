sergei eisenstein's most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time. the story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of soviet propaganda, but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt. the scene on the odessa steps should remain seared into anyone's mind.<br /><br />okay, so "the battleship potemkin" wasn't actually the first movie to use montage, but they did a great job with it here. certainly any film history class should show this movie. it's a great historical drama (although i will admit that i don't know how accurate it is). a 10/10.<br /><br />oh, and we should have learned by now that "potemkin" should be transliterated as "potyomkin".
