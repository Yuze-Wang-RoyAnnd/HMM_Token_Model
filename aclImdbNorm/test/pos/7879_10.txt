peter boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun-ho bigot, making me hate him everytime he used the "n" word, i watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out. ( just think, peter boyle was a monk once) (now a supporting actor in "everybody loves raymond") susan sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water. i noticed a large raggerty ann doll(creator, john gruelle) was the only thing that susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes. if you really want to know about the way out 70's with drugs, free love and pipe dreams, then, enjoy the excellent direction of john g. avildsen ("rocky and "the karate kid") i always thought that peter boyle should have been blown away in the end!! this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.
