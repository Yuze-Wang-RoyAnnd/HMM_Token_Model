i was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and by the mood it created. i think it should have gotten a great deal more credit than it did. i agree that michelle pfeiffer should have been nominated, but i think all the performances were outstanding, and that michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. although i didn't read the book, i found the modern concept of king lear very cool. i certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again!
