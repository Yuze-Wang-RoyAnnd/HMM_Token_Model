i saw this at the 2004 stony brook film festival in ny and it was very warmly received. in this pre-ww2 film, a pair of german rocket scientists are working on the scottish isle of scarp as war looms on the horizon. the characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal. shauna macdonald is particularly memorable<br /><br />after getting up to speed on the "scootish" accents, the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. as implausible as it seems, this film was based on an actual story.<br /><br />all in all, a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting, its story or its scenery.
