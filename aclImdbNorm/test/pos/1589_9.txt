this is a ravishing, yet spare adaption of thomas mann's novelette of the same title. dirk bogarde gives his finest screen performance - he himself believed so. the dialogue is minimal, so his face must register the nuances of his anguished character - a composer (a writer in the novelette - the only major alteration) who travels to venice in 1910. visconti revels in the portrayal of beauty, it's passing, and the whiff of decay beneath.trained as an opera director, visconti blends mahler's music and imagery seamlessly in his finest film since "the leopard" (another stunning film, which greatly influenced coppola's sicily in the "godfather").
