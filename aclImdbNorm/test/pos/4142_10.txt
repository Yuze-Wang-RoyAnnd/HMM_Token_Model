the buddy holly story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 lubbock, texas. as the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. it's a tracking shot welles and scorcese would both appreciate. it cuts to buddy holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio. <br /><br />a young gary busey plays buddy holly and his performance is key. he has to somehow show the passion that holly had for his music to make the film work. this is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. this isn't about a man with several women to choose between in a sex scandalized, brood abandoned lusty tragedy. this is a film about a nice texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. busey finds that spark and ignites it, his passion is clear and infectious. he really plays the guitar in the film and sings, its not overdubbed with holly's recordings. busey was a young guy in hollywood in the seventies, a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well. thus, he gives a great performance, because although he isn't buddy holly, he's in a similar situation. <br /><br />his first song is the old les paul classic, "mockingbird hill" and he has the country twang to nail it. next a kid calls out for some bop, and against his two band mates (in reality the crickets were 3 guys, but the down-sizing works fine for the film's limited narrative)he leads them wailing into "rocking with ollie vee". the kids love it and the parents hate it. the dj at the rolling rink tapes it and it is later released in new york without buddy holly even knowing it was ever recorded. this leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments. an amped-up disc jockey from buffalo calls up buddy at home. the dj has been playing "that'll be the day" for 12 hours and is going for 24. the cops are banging on the station's barricaded door. holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is quite thrilled. he tells the boys, and their meteoric rise begins. dan stroud as the drummer and charles martin smith as the bassist round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other. there are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock (all?) biopics. the movie doesn't manipulate you either. your emotions soar, but they're not manipulated. when the crickets step onto the apollo stage in harlem, the first white group ever to play there, then rip into an electrically charged performance of "oh boy" and win the audience over, my rock and roll loving ass got choked up and cried. next, busey and the boys make "it's so easy" sound funkier and more soulful than i would have believed possible. <br /><br />anyone with even a cursory knowledge of buddy holly's story will know where this movie will end. holly died in a plane crash with richie valens and the big bopper way too young. we, as the audience know that, yet the movie is so well written, directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately. the movie isn't about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. the film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of busey rocking out possessed by the ghost of buddy holly. i was happy to hear him end it on "not fade away", my favorite of his songs. the film freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash, but i hardly noticed it. i was still thinking about how good that last song was.
