i have seen a few of fred carpenter's movies on showtime, pay per view and video/dvd and i enjoyed most of these films especially with a few beers, (carpenter knows how to entertain)"eddie monroe" and "murdered innocence" are my favorites. i recently viewed a promo dvd of "eddie monroe" and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly. (doug brown's music score was sensational.) i enjoyed seeing frank sivero ("goodfellas", "new york, new york" and "the wedding singer"), he is an amazing and very underrated actor.but i especially liked the performance of paul vario who played uncle benny, i looked up his acting credits on the imdb and i found out this was his first starring role. where has this guy been! give fred carpenter credit for discovering great new talent, it's only a matter of time you'll be seeing this guy costarring with pacino and deniro. as i mentioned carpenter knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what carpenter can produce.(i read the vent magazine interview and carpenter has never made a movie for more than $400,000.00 dollars.) before i watched "eddie monroe" i saw "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd" both great films. "eddie monroe" took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script, good performances from the entire cast(craig morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead actress jessica tsunis was hot!) great cinematography, direction and doug brown's music score. as i stated i recently seen "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd", if i were to write a comment about those two movies i would be saying some of the same things i have stated about "eddie monroe", the only thing those two very good films don't have in common with "eddie monroe", they didn't cost a few hundred grand. great movie and i didn't even drink a beer.
