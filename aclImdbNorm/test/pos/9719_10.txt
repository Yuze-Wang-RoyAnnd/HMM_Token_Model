i remember my dad hiring these episodes on video. my whole family loved them, and now that i have moved away from home and have my own life i am trying to share these fabulous jim henson creations with my husband and stepson but as i am starting to find out not everyone is a henson fan. which is a pity since it means they will just have to put up with me searching for this series. but even though they don't find these interesting, i would highly recommend anybody getting hold of the storyteller. you will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to care if they were ever confronted with these situations.
