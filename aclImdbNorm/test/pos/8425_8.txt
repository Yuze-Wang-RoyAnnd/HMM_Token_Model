despite this production having received a number of poor reviews, it actually holds up quite well for its age. note also that it is not a bbc programme, it was simply licensed to them by granada ventures when the jane austen collection was released on dvd.<br /><br />so how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel? the most well-known version these days is the 1995 film with amanda root as anne elliott and ciaran hinds as captain frederick wentworth. that film was of course shorter but a good snapshot of the story - the earlier version, with ann firbank and bryan marshall in the same roles, had four hours to tell the story and moved at a more leisurely pace.<br /><br />firbank is a good ten years too old for her role, but she is very good - marshall is excellent as wentworth, a man disappointed in love, and bitter about interference. and hidden in the cast are people who also contribute - michael culver, later seen in cadfael, as harvill; richard vernon, later seen in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, as admiral croft; noel dyson, earlier in coronation street, as mrs musgrove.<br /><br />one criticism i do have is that the hairstyles are a bit distracting, and that the costumes are awful! still, this shouldn't detract from a hugely enjoyable austen adaptation.
