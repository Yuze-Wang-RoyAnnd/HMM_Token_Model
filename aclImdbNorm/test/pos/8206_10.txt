wow! in my opinion, the net is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. when i first saw it, i was feeling good all over for days. when angela (sandra bullock) went to mexico, i thought to myself, "that is a really nice place to vacation." from the moment jack (jermey northam) and ruth (wendy gazelle) began chasing her, i thought to myself, "don't let anything bad happen to her! please!" i also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than i already had. on the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. in conclusion, i give this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars.
