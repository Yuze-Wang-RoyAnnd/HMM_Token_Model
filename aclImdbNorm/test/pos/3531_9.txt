it may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of "slasher" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. this is a great "rare" film from jeff lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films "squirm" and "blue sunshine".<br /><br />five young people head into the oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh.<br /><br />"just before dawn" is noticeably more ambitious, "arty", and intelligent than some slasher films. lieberman actually fleshes out the characters - well, two of them, anyway - as much as a 90-minute-long film will allow him. the film has genuine moments of suspense and tension, and actually refrains from graphic gore, save for one killing right at the beginning.<br /><br />there is an above-average cast here, including oscar winner george kennedy, as a forest ranger who's understandably gone a little flaky from having been alone in the wilderness for too long. jack lemmon's son chris, future brian de palma regular gregg henry, blonde lead deborah benson (it's too bad she hasn't become a more well-known performer, judging by her work here), ralph seymour ("ghoulies"), mike kellin ("sleepaway camp"), and jamie rose ("chopper chicks in zombietown") round out the cast.<br /><br />some of the shots are interesting, and the early music score by brad feidel (now best known for his "terminator" theme) is haunting and atmospheric.<br /><br />this is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark, although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical; it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon! one of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer, which i'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again.<br /><br />i didn't give it 10 out of 10 because i can't honestly that i was that frightened. still, it's an interesting slasher that is worthy of re-discovery.<br /><br />"that deed don't mean nothing, son. those mountains can't read."<br /><br />9/10
