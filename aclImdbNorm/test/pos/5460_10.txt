although a made for cable film by hbo, it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at the back-stabbing and double-dealing world of television. allowing the viewer to peek behind the scenes of the so-called late night talk show wars in the early 90s, as jay leno and david letterman competed for the coveted position as host of the tonight show. kathy bates gives a bravo performance as leno's mercurial manager helen kushnick and one can feel empathy for what leno/letterman endured at the hands of tv executives. it is just as timely now, considering the recent events involving the failed attempt by abc to replace nightline with letterman. no matter how many times i have seen this film, i still find it as much a pleasure to watch as i did when it first aired. if this should ever be released on dvd, i would certainly add it to my collection.
