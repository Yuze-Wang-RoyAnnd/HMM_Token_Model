sandra bullock paints a believable picture as the troubled detective, though seeing her as a cynical man-eating victim-turned-persecutor requires a leap of faith (or two). the two creepy troubled kids are portrayed adequately by ryan gosling and michael pitt. <br /><br />i do have quite a bit of trouble getting ben chaplin into the equation (same problem arose when watching 'the truth about cats & dogs' (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979/). i mean, when you put an englishman into an all-american movie, shouldn't there at least be a reason to put him there? shouldn't there be some story leading up to the fact that an englishman is serving as a detective on an american police force? shouldn't there be some dialog pointing out and explaining that rather obvious fact? or even some jokes about him being that english? <br /><br />he looks out of place here, as he looked out of place in 'the truth about cats & dogs'. producers really should take notice, it distracts and annoys the audience (at least me). nothing wrong with chaplin's acting, it's just a matter of making an actor who is 'out of place' believable and not putting him somewhere without a good reason or a storyline. <br /><br />the movie itself: well, thrillers, especially those dealing with solving a complicated crime, require some suspension of disbelief. this one's no different; actually, it requires quite a bit more effort than usual. in order to make bullock smart enough to crack the case despite of all the pressures requiring her to let go of it, some unrealistic assumptions are being made about the evidence, and i'm sure a lot of people who watched it had a few moments of 'come on, this is highly unlikely under the circumstances' or even 'hey, you can't brush evidence aside like that to wrap this movie up!'. <br /><br />like i said: reasonably entertaining and watchable. just don't use this as required viewing for detective exams. there are no shortcuts there.
