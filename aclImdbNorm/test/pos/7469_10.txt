very tightly written, acted, and filmed. violent, but not too much so. whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. there isn't a wasted scene in this movie. "the usual suspects" was superb ensemble acting; this is a collection of outstanding individual performances. i rarely buy movies, but this one is worth owning.
