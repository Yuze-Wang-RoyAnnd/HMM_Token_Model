seriously people need to lighten up and just accept that funny is funny, and this movie is f**king hilarious. better than the first and knoxville really grew a pair for this film and did way more crazier stunts then the first. if ebert and roper(not saying that i'm a huge fan of theirs) can look past the pure idiocy of this film enough to give it 2 thumbs up then i think other people can to. i wasn't sure what to expect from this but i was floored and it is rare when a sequel is better than the original. this new one i believe exceeds the first big time. so do what i did,just relax kick back try not to barf at some points and laugh your ass off.
