i first saw this film about 15 years ago, and i have been enchanted by it ever since. it is such a feel-good experience, that i could happily watch it at any time of the year. however, to me, it is the ultimate christmas movie.<br /><br />the fact that it is in b&w is irrelevant - although i often wonder what it would be like in colour. you can just get that warm, glowing feeling watching the christmas events unfold. <br /><br />stanwyck and morgan are perfect together, and greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, sakall is a blustering joy to watch.<br /><br />it is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain, but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it.<br /><br />i can't wait for it to become available on dvd in the uk. i shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it.
