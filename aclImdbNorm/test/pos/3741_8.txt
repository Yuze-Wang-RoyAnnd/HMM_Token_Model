nights in rodanthe brings back to the screen two talented actors in diane lane and richard gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. the chemistry between lane and gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. the locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care. james franco in another micro role is just the right casting, and the elegance of lane in combination with the beach house, is a true fall 2008 film to remember forever, as was the notebook.
