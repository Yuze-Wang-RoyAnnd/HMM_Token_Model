one has to take martin & lewis like a dash of salt & pepper. why does martin put up with lewis? then again, why do all the women in this movie like jerry? because he is innocently likeable! martin sings a few good songs (lip-sync'd at least once) and jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined. i generally find that i can take just so much of jerry's antics before they become aggravating. but.... in this film, watch when jerry gets stuck outside on a submerging navy submarine! excellent! buster keaton should have been proud. i give the film a 7.
