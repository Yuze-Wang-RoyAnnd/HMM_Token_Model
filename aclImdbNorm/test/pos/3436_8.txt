in december 1945 a train leaves the central station of stockholm for berlin. there aren't much left when it arrives. not of the train and not of some passengers.<br /><br />this is a black comedy directed by peter dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. the actors must have had lots of fun making it. they aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.<br /><br />a deadly black and deadly funny film. see it, if you didn't think the swedes were capable of humour.
