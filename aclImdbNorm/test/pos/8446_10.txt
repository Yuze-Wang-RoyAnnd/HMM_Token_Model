>>>>author: msgreen-1 from canada >>>>the big problem was the "china syndrome" claim - that if the reactor error occurred and radioactive waste leaked out it could burn its way straight through the earth to china. a lot of people have made fun of this and if the movie makers meant it seriously then yes it should be made fun of. the spill wouldn't make it anywhere near the center of the earth or even the molten rock. even if it did make it to the center of the earth how would it come out in china? it would have to flow against gravity the rest of the way! also china is not the opposite side of the world, the indian ocean is.<<<<< ......... ......... ........................ ................ ..................... .................. .............. ............ ................<br /><br />this point is brought up by the characters of the film, saying that of course it could not happen, as the core would hit ground water and release a radio-active cloud, raining down on the population.<br /><br />before you try to find a weak point in the film, you should watch it first!!!! don't judge a book by it's title...
