i saw this mini-series when i was in high school. i remember it as being absolutely brilliant and compelling. at the time, i knew none of the british actors in the series, but have since learned that some of today's stars performed in it, including sean connery (the original james bond among many other roles), judi dench (queen elizabeth in "shakespeare in love" among many other roles) and eilene atkins (probably best known for creating "upstairs/downstairs" but also superb in many acting roles). like the other commentator, i would like to see it again. i'm certain the production remains timeless, and i would hope that it has been or will be released on vhs or dvd. if you get a chance to see it, do not miss it.
