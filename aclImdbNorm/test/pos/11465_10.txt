this is a great horror film for people who don't want all that vomit-retching gore and sensationalism. this movie has equal amounts of horror, suspense, humor, and even a little light nudity, but nothing big. linnea quigley isn't over the top as she was in "return of the living dead" where she danced naked on a crypt, but she is still essentially the same slutty character. cathy podewell is a virginal and chaste character before going on to "dallas," and we are also introduced to amelia [soon mimi] kinkade,the sexy and sinister would-be dark matron of the house. as she and linnea are possessed and take over the house, they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits out of the survivors. i've heard a lot of people compare this movie to "the evil dead," but if anything, this movie is a rival to that one the same way freddie rivaled jason.this movie series though is far superior to that one !
