attending this film was an excuse to escape the work i had to do for my classes but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in france. the film makes quick work of building multidimensional characters and has an excellently smooth storyline. the characters really did have the voices you would expect reading the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations the music was catchy and the comedy toying and lighthearted, almost a flinstoneish inclusion of modern items in playful manners. the film was attention grabbing, cute and action packed at the same time. a wonderful tale spun expertly. i'll be showing it to my french students.
