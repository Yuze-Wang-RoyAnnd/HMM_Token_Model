if you like movies that will make you think, this is absolutely one of the good ones. i always liked david lynch and cronenberg. they have always made high-quality movies.<br /><br />iain softley has directed k-pax brilliantly. the movie tears in feelings and philosophy of the mind and world. kevin spacey and jeff bridges both delivers superb acting skills. it caught me, i did not take my eyes away from the screen during the movie. on the other hand, if you are hoping for a special effect sci-fi movie, this is not for you. the story is being dragged a bit, which can be a bit boring, but also works as a way of building up the theme of the movie.<br /><br /> enjoy this film, i did..
