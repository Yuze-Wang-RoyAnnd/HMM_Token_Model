i caught this at the chicago indiefest and have to say you are alone is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think. not ha ha wedding crashers' funny, but sick, twisted, i can't believe she just said that but it's so damn true funny.<br /><br />jessica bohl, who deservedly won best actress, is amazing to watch. there's never a moment when you think oh, i'm watching a movie and she's an actress. she's too damn real for words.<br /><br />in fact there's 2 scenes that i'm still giggling over, and i won't give them away, but in one she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how "awesome" it is. (i almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing!!!) <br /><br />in another she talks about a teenagers definition of "sex" versus an adults, and if it isn't the truest dialog i've heard in a movie in a long time, i don't know what is.
