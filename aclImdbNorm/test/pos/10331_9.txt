this movie should have easily qualified as a film<br /><br />that best promotes human understanding among people.<br /><br />it may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped german prisoner of war.<br /><br />kristy mcnichol depicts an amazing portrait of the unhappy, young girl thirsting for acceptance and love. michael constantine gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and esther rolle, as the maid, ruth, gave a superb emmy-winning performance as an understanding maid caught up with these events.<br /><br />bruce davison portrays the german who is supposedly not guilty of nazi atrocities. this is how his role appears. he has escaped, but he joined the german army and he might have been a member of the hitler youth movement.<br /><br />the action takes place in 1944 georgia, in a rural area. the townspeople are filled with prejudice. even the fbi inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the jews. notice the opposite interpretation that as mcnichol is in bed, davison is hunted down and ultimately shot. it is interesting to see that society views mcnichol as a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war. the film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. constantine's outburst at his daughter at the end is some acting. as the mother, barbara barrie, is given little to do. it was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical jewish mother with that loud shade of lipstick on her lips.<br /><br />memorably done and well worth viewing.
