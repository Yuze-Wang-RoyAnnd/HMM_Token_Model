this movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed, on australia's special broadcasting service. i thought i read here that there is sometimes an assumption that *revenge of the rats* is a sequel. in fact, the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie, or in human history. there is no prequel as far as i know.<br /><br />now, let's get the pied piper of hamelin out of the way. perhaps this tale crossed my mind when i was watching the film, but that's all. there was the use of the word "coffers" at the end of the movie. a dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying "the coffers were empty". "coffers" isn't a word you hear around much these days, unless you read folk tales to your children, as i do. since seeing *revenge of the rats*, i've read two versions of the pied piper of hamelin. now i see the comparison. a metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford, to get rid of the rats. this is about as far as i can follow the analogy. the children are not led to a door in a mountain, with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains, where it is always spring and everyone is always happy.<br /><br />there's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie. the romance and the resolution especially. the female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent. where this film is quite rebellious (as compared with american cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. the helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for "doing good". the mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money. finally, it is left to one doctor in frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease. apparently there is no national infectious diseases authority to co-ordinate things or send in back-up.<br /><br />i'm not a horror aficionado, so any horror i do see is usually mingled with humour. right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too.
