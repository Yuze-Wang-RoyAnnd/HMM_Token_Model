although not the most technically advanced film i have seen, this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them, and feel something when susie q. has to go, but feel good again when she returns as maggie.<br /><br />lots of stock dialogue, and a contrived plot-line, but most of all, lots of fun.
