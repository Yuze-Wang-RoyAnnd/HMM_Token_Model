usually i do not like movies with/about aliens but k-pax is different. the actors are great in the movie - especially kevin spacey played his character breathtaking! the movie never fall to a lower level - the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely wanna know how it ends, what's about prot... you have to think a lot after the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions... is robert porter prot or is prot only using robert porters body as a means of transportation. how can he see uv-light and how can he know that much about astrology. but everybody can make his own end and can decide in what he wanna believe. very good movie with an excellent kevin spacey!
