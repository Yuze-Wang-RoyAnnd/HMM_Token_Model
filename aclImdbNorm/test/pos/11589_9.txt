in spain, the former sailor ram'on sampedro (javier bardem) has been quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend g'ene (clara segura). ram'on is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause, julia (bel'en rueda), who has a degenerative fatal disease; and meets rosa (lola due~nas), a lonely worker that has been abused by men. their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of rosa and julia.<br /><br />the chilean alejandro amen'abar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. his filmography released in brazil is composed by excellent and original movies: "abre los ojos", "tesis", "the others" and "mar adentro". javier bardem is probably the best actor in spain in the present days. their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme, the right of committing euthanasia. this drama is never corny or depressive, since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations. the performances of the cast are perfect, with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme. the dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent. i noted in imdb plot outline that this movie is based on the real-life story of ram'on sampedro. unfortunately, neither the movie nor the dvd gives this important information. my vote is nine.<br /><br />title (brazil): "mar adentro" ("sea inside")
