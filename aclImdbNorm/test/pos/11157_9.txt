okay, i know that's clich'e. taken on its surface, this is a bad film- perhaps in a league with "plan 9 from outer space". the dialog is suspect (but the singlish is quite enjoyable...), the plot is not quite believable, gavin's character overacts excessively. while watching the movie, somethings happen that truly make you wonder... handsome and kim making out on a tank, gwen eating a banana in a bath, just about everything gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho!!"). these things taken separately are perhaps flaws. taken together, however, they are merely quirks. watching this movie with an open-mind (especially if you're not familiar with singaporean culture), and with an open-minded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time. you can't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece, or even expecting to take anything serious at all. if you can take this film for what it is - an underdog film about underdogs, filled to the brim with its own quirks - then you should have a good time watching this one! i've already seen it three times and i wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times!!
