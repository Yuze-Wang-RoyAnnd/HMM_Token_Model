from director billy wilder (double indemnity, the seven year itch, some like it hot), i can see that this is a bit of an under-shown and underrated film, one to be seen. this is the biographical story of charles augustus 'slim' lindbergh (james stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from new york, crossing the atlantic ocean, to reach paris, in a small cockpit. the first half hour or whatever is seeing lindbergh getting permission to do it, and the construction of the plane, named "the spirit of st. louis", and making all necessary preparations. then of course the rest sees his perilous journey crossing the journey, overcoming tiredness, near fuel loss, and moments of losing sense of direction, but he was successful. also starring murray hamilton as bud gurney, patricia smith as mirror girl, bartlett robinson as benjamin frank mahoney, robert cornthwaite as harry knight, sheila bond as model/dancer, marc connelly as father hussman, arthur space as donald hall, harlan warde as boedecker and dabbs greer as goldsborough. apparently lindbergh was a bit younger, so stewart was a shade too old to play him, but then again, you can't think of anyone else that could do better. it is a witty and emotional drama, with stewart (as always) being fantastic, great music score by frank waxman, and good direction from wilder, a good little known gem. it was nominated the oscar for best special effects (the only award it was ever nominated). james stewart was number 12 on the 100 greatest movie stars, he was number 3 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, and he was number 13 on the world's greatest actor. very good!
