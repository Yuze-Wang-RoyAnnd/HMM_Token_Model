the idea of young girl, who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre. but it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre. there is this basic plot of lorelai and rory, mother and daughter. lorelai comes from a wealthy background, got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17. but this series does not start there, it starts when rory is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother, who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16.<br /><br />okay, now again this sounds pretty normal, but there is this little thing called joke. the gilmore girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute. even if you don't understand all of the jokes, since they contain hundreds of references to films, music, gossip, history, literature and politics. sometimes you even get confused, but that really is the fun. and not only it is fast, it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. in addition to that it is not only funny, it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home. which is a thing that does not go for every single tv- series.<br /><br />so watch it! it'll lighten your mood and help you through hard decisions!
