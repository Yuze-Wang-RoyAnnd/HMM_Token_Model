ok, first, to all the haters: get a life! i don't see why you even bother to post on these boards, when obviously you know nothing about cinema, robots, or people. <br /><br />this movie has an important lessons for all of us to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships, and destiny. really, we are all robots, programmed to respond certain ways to certain stimuli without thinking. how many times have we seen a sunset and made some trite comment without even thinking about it? i say, thank you aqua (brilliantly played by bernadette peters) for making me stop and think about the awesome power of mother nature. <br /><br />it's only when val and aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire--to find love, and to flee the factory in search of a creative life. this movie should be mandatory viewing in prisons--just think of the dreams and hopes it could inspire in the inmates. maybe even they could overcome their "bad" programming and join the rest of us in a crime-free world.<br /><br />we can all learn a lot from these robots. i am a better person for heartbeeps.
