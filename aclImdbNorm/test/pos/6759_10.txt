there is a complete copy now available at the internet archive - watch it or download it today!<br /><br />http://www.archive.org/details/the_mascot_complete<br /><br />one of the greatest animated shorts ever made. starewicz is endlessly inventive and his techniques still astound animation fans 70 years later. we may have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that wouldn't take "no" for an answer. whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created. <br /><br />and he wanted to see some truly bizarre stuff - every imaginable piece of scrap is called up for service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats....seems like there was nothing that was off limits.<br /><br />a truly eerie, even unsettling film that should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in animation. this film must be seen to be believed!
