latter days is a very, very independent movie. and compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. the shooting seems at times quite amateurish, the dialogues can be a bit chopped up and the characters are not impressively complex. so, don't have too high hopes for this movie, because as i've said, it's very independent. but whatever it lacks in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the story's charm! i cannot claim that the plot is outstandingly original, but the story is still beautiful and heart-warming in many ways! it's not about being gay versus being straight, it's about faith, and how you decide to run your own life! it's a silly story, that makes you want to both cry and smile at the same time! so to be honest, latter days is far from perfect, but i truly loved the movie and i highly recommend it! it's very critical towards the religious aspects of our society, and there is homosexuality involved - but approach it with an open mind, and i'm pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself!
