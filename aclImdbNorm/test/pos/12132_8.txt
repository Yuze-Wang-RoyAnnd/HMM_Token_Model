surprisingly good "mean streets"-type crime drama. foreshadows elements of "goodfellas" and "casino". joe pesci's first big role. clever dialog. i think the maltin guide gives this a bomb rating. i can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it.<br /><br />saw this at tarantino's film fest and he said scorsese used a number of these actors in raging bull.
