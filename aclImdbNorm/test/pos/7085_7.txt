"one true thing" puts zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother (streep). somber and plodding, the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child. an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault, "ott" offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death.
