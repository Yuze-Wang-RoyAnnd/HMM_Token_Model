this isn't so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details, so i advise you not to read this review if you haven't seen the film, because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you.<br /><br />in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial aspect - some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water, while the storyline itself (especially what brendt sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the narrative) is reminiscent of films like fight club (lead character interacts with someone created in their mind), mulholland drive (character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of lost highway, jacob's ladder, and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness, plus amenabar's films (the others, abre los ojos), memento (particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory), et al. thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact, and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience.<br /><br />many people have commented on the "confusing" nature of the narrative, but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self-explanatory, even if it is in part portrayed in a non-sequential manner. the narrative only becomes confusing for some because, midway through the final third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting (ie. soo-mi's warped perception of reality) to an objective one, with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soo-mi's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard, but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive (even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies - something which, in turn, reminded me of another lynch movie, lost highway). to be honest, i don't really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness (and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film).<br /><br />that aside, the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i've seen this side of wong kar wai's 2046. the performances are also fantastic without exception, and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future; not to mention the music, but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days.<br /><br />it's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as "yet another asian horror film", oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach. but then each to their own. if you can ignore some of the film's platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart, ie. an extremely tragic, heart-breaking story, then i see no reason not to recommend it.
