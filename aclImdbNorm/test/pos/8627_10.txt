the duo of abbott and costello lives on in this version of a story-time classic. in "jack and the beanstalk", there's everything to see, music, magic, and comedy rolled into one. costello play plays jack after he listens to the story being told by a young boy one time. we know jack was a poor boy who sells his cow "dolly" for 5 magic beans. well, he plants those 5 beans, and they were indeed, magic. he climbs to the sky, sees a big castle there, and he would sing a song, unknown he would encounter the giant(buddy baer). not only him, he would dance with the woman who was also a giant. she would clobber jack with her elbows during the dance. that was funny! you got the playing harp who knows how to put the giant as ease. the goose who lays golden eggs. and my favorite, the way jack gets rid of the giant. he gets the ax, and started chopping down on the beanstalk. another funny is where the ax got stuck during the chop, and the final celebration happens when the people dance around the imprint where the giant fell. a lot of fun, and fun for the whole family as well. very recommended! 5 stars!
