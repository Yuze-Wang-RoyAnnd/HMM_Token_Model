an incredible performance! this is one of the best films i have seen ever. i know this is being said a lot, but i bet you will not regret watching this film.<br /><br />it's great from the very beginning to the last second. the acting (of especially the mother - played by judith light) is so convincing, there are not many other films i've seen that could compare to it, and it seems it's impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama.<br /><br />there are lots and lots of movies made every year, but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life - make this one of them.
