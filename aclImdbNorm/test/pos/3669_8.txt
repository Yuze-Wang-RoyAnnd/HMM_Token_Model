ignore everyone else's comments for this movie and watch it on pay cable (like i did) or rent it. you owe it to yourself. this film is what movies are (supposed to be) all about. hard to categorize (and god knows how this was pitched as a "high concept"!), but this is one for the angels. check it out. what have you got to lose?
