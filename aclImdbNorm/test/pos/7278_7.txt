after reading the terrible reviews of this movie, including comments said to be quoted from colin, i almost didn't bother to add this film to my firth film collection, however being the firth fan which i am, intrigue got the better of me!<br /><br />to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed the movie. it had suspense,drama and intrigue and v.sexy colin scene's. the plot kept me guessing right until the end credits and i felt that once one got past jennifer rubens opening scene's that the actress played her role convincingly. colin was as brilliant as ever and its great to see him play a character from the 'dark side', a 'chill went down my spine' and after watching this i can't wait to see colins recent film 'trauma'soon to be out on dvd. <br /><br />ok, perhaps it 'wasn't a film that was 'in your face' so to speak and one couldn't 'go to sleep on the plot',especially towards the end as there was a lot going on, but that was what i liked about it, the acting was subtle, thankfully not overdone (like many suspense thrillers), this made the film all the more chilling to watch. one just couldn't second guess what colins character (ross talbert), or for that matter jennifer rubens character(jamie harris) was going to do next, and there were quite a few surprises in store, i sat on the edge of my seat throughout, with a cushion handy!!<br /><br />personally i am very glad that i watched 'playmaker' and i shall certainly rewind and view again. i think that any firth fan would benefit from watching this film, if they didn't like the plot then just watch colin ;-))
