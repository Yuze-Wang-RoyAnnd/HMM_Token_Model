farscape - is the one sci-fi show which restarted the interest in science fiction in me.<br /><br />but farscape is so much more then plain and simple sci-fi. comedy, drama and much more :) the acting is very good. luckily farscape survived also it's cancellation and showed with peacekeeper wars that it is not dead yet :) i hope there is a future for farscape :) in my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the show are muppets. you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty farscape is.<br /><br />farscape set a new standard in television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than farscape. i love this show :)<br /><br />saphirjd
