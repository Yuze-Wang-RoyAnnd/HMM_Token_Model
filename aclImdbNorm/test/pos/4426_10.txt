i just returned from viewing this academy award-nominated doc, and i was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this fellow i'd never heard of before. of course i'm someone who's captivated with beautiful architecture, so i realize others won't care.<br /><br />we can only imagine if there had been a couple more visionaries in philadelphia back in the late 60's when kahn's plans were a possibility, what a wonderful city center there would be. if you wonder whether you'll see more about the bangladesh building at the beginning of the movie, be patient, for there it will provide the climax of the film at the end. <br /><br />his son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching, and even funny at times. there is one of the most comical anti-visionary rants ever captured on camera.<br /><br />rounding out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music. and expressiveness is a major point to be found in kahn's architecture. the points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter, and how kahn's buildings brought that out tie together the overall experience of this movie.
