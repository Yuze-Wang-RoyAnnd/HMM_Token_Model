i agree with andy, this is a good movie. kevin mckidd's character is believable throughout the film. we're forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him. paula sage who plays roberta puts in a good performance too. it's thought-provoking and emotive without any slush over-production. credit to director alison peebles and writer andrea gibb for that. a very worthwhile viewing. the pace of the film is just right, raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in, rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style. nice little soundtrack to go with the film too, again used sparingly, not to distract you from storyline. recommended.
