the art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema! well, at least it is in this movie. nobody in this movie are amused. they are all either annoyed or shocked, and if they aren't yet, they soon will be! it is a story of screw-ups, murder, embarrassment, dignity, and, in the end, love and redemption. the chilling, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and won't appeal to everyone, but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd. you pity the characters from a distance, even as you dislike them up close and personal. but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them, even when they get away with murder.<br /><br />this is, in my judgment, definitely the best danish movie of the last few years.<br /><br />9 out of 10.
