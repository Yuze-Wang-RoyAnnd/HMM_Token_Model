unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/ this movie provides no background information. we are shown a snapshot of the fall of danton, his mock process and execution but, unless one studied the revolution quite extensively, it is difficult to understand where characters come from ( fouquier-tinville, philippeau, desmoulins, robespierre... ) and thus to appreciate them for what they are: danton and joe blobb could be the same person to the viewer. for example robespierre & desmoulins were close friends since their youth, and this explains how robespierre acts. those who know the facts, though, will easily orient themselves and appreciate this good movie with actors delivering solid acting, no useless subplots and good reconstruction of the times. desmoulins and danton are the best characters, but all do a good job, even the 'demented' saint-just portrayed as sort of psychopath. 'terreur' was a period of massacres whose importance hasn't been fully documented and that -for the most part- were driven by ambition, greed and the settling of personal disputes, fed to ignorant sans-culottes as the next epochal step against tyranny.
