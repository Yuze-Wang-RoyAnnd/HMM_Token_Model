i recently started to watch this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss. some episodes are silly -- doug is upset about some trivial/juvenile thing and acts stupid etc.<br /><br />still, others are quite amusing, and sometimes touching. these include those episodes that face up to the complexities of the characters. for instance, the "juvenile overweight amiable guy marries sexy wife" theme is found in several sitcoms. (carrie also has something about her, looks-wise. not just a run of the mill sexy girl.) but, carrie has an edge -- she might be nice on the eyes, but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father.<br /><br />and, she readily admits to it -- for instance, one episode revolves at her lack of desire to be nice to co-workers. i personally find her b*ness sexy, but you have to be the right sort of person to be able to live with that. amiable doug is a good match. and, deep down, see likes the simple things too. maybe, not as much as doug whose nirvana is watching tv and eating a big snack next to his big screen t.v., but no culture gal she. this lack of an overally sensitive side is one reason the two don't have children. <br /><br />of course, the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either, and adds to the charm of the show. they live an ordinary working class sort of life in queens -- it is realistic in that sense. and, overall, amusing and pleasant sitcom fare, esp. if you just want to relax. it gets a little tired at the end, so it's probably good it is ending. it had a good run. see also, becker.
