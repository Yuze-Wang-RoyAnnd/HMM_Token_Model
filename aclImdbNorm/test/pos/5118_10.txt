if i had to decide which was the best ernest movie, and don't act like that sort of thing doesn't happen all time, it would be this one.<br /><br />all of the ernest movies are entertaining, but the best ones are the ones that have jim varney doing a number of different characters. additionally, i am known to enjoy the comedy stylings of bill byrge and gailard sartain as brothers chuck and bobby tulip. "ernest goes to jail" contains all of those elements as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved character actors.<br /><br />and that is why i have chosen "ernest goes to jail" as the king of all ernest movies. disagree with me if you must, but deep down you know i am right.
