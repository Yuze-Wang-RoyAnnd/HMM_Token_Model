strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. why? they are hilarious. this is hilarious. notice a lot of the quirky humor. dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. they got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. the art in this is probabley the best non-road runner art of the 1950's looney tunes shorts. it's hard to come across something better than the art in "the great piggy bank robbery", although nothing ever will. this probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd. shorts like this one might have spawned witless lt rip-offs like tiny toons adventures to try to squeeze out all the old comedy out over and over again, like how great movies like scream spawned crap like i know... which was released just to squeeze out all the old horror from scream, but like scream, this is great alone. chuck jones has had his faults with shorts once in a while but he does make up for them. take hopper for example. few people like hopper but it never ruined the lt reputation, but i'm sure this was his make up on things as such. bottom line: this is not as good as "duck! rabbit! duck!", but close. catch it on cartoon network frequently.
