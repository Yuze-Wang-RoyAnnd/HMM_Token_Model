a milestone in cinematic history, 'bronenosets potyomkin' is one of the handful of great films out there that richly deserves to be called a classic. it was the picture that made sergei m. eisenstein a figurehead of film-making at the time. and today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been.<br /><br />'potyomkin' is a film that needs to be seen as one entity, not to be picked at. don't just watch those clip shows where they only present the 'odessa steps' sequence and then move on to 'citizen kane' or 'the godfather', see it all in it's glorious 75-minute running time to really understand and enjoy it. don't expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect though, i mean the acting of the '20s silent era makes 'scooby doo' look like a master of understated realism, certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences look dated, but it is still an immensely enjoyable movie.<br /><br />the most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship, vakulinchuk's body falling off the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child, the baby carriage on the odessa steps and the lion rising up to roar as further carnage ensues. for each new pair of eyes that look upon it, 'the battleship potemkin' comes alive once again.
