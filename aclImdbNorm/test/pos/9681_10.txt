family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost it's sharp and random humor at the start of season 6. although i enjoyed blue harvest, it felt like the remaining episodes were "wrapping-up" - episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guy's reputation of american social satire.<br /><br />i have seen all the episodes from season 7 and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again. season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now - more fun.<br /><br />i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together, this show, however, has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be. great job!
