this landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the grapevine video release which also includes the english translation of selma lagerlof's novel which she based on a swedish folktale. the first version is the swedish edit under the title of the phantom carriage. the second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the united states under the title of the stroke of midnight as released by metro (before it was m-g- m). the actual us release has long vanished but a detailed review in the new york times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for domestic release -- and both are fascinating to see. each version of this film was presented at the organ loft in salt lake city with live theatre organ scores provided by artist blaine gale. a live recording was made of these performances and are included on the grapevine video dvd along with the novel and notes about the two versions. while the phantom carriage follows the order of lagerlof's novel, the stroke of midnight is in some ways easier to follow. seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries. <br /><br />some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not. this is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message. the directing and lead performance by the great victor sjostrom were way ahead of their time. it's easy to see why m-g-m brought him to hollywood to direct such films as lillian gish in the scarlet letter and the wind as well as lon chaney in he who gets slapped. in america he was known as victor seastrom. he would also star in the lead role of ingmar bergman's wild strawberries, giving a masterful performance. bergman was greatly influenced by korkarlen or the phantom carriage in his earlier days. <br /><br />this is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study. the grapevine video release is an excellent way to do this.
