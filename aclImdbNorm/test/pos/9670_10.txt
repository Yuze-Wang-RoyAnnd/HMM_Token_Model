this is the greatest show ever made next to south park. i love this show! it is so funny, and peter's laugh is hilarious. you need to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before. one of my favorite shows of all time.<br /><br />if you can, try to see some of the later episodes such as i dream of jesus, or tales of a third grade nothing. but there's never been an episode i didn't like. all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious. it's got a great satire to it as well. you can find a lot of clips on you tube. if you're somewhere near a computer or a tv see it right away however you can.
