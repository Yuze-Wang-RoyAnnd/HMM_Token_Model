let me say from the outset i'm not a particular fan of this kind of film, but nightbreed holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective.<br /><br />back in the old days, the folks who inhabit midian would have been called zombies, the undead. and according to what clive barker has given us certain members of human kind, in this craig sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world.<br /><br />psychiatrist david cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the nightbreed. he tricks the police into killing sheffer, but sheffer goes to a graveyard named midian cemetery where the nightbreed congregate and live underground. <br /><br />sheffer has also left a girl friend, anne bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he's been killed and is now one of the undead. she tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind. <br /><br />clive barker's creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans. but it's plain to see that if humans left them alone, the nightbreed in turn not bother with them.<br /><br />your sympathies are definitely with the nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like cronenberg and redneck police chief charles haid in action.<br /><br />clive barker's been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. i can see where that would come in, especially since there are a whole lot of people who don't even think of gays as anything human because they're taught that way.<br /><br />granted nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence, but it also does make you think and i do like the way clive barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes craig sheffer a kind of messiah for the nightbreed creatures.
