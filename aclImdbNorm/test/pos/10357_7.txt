brain of blood starts as abdul amir (reed hadley) the leader of a country called kahlid is close to death because of cancer, however if he dies kahlid will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor robert nigserian (grant williams) & one of amir's devotees mohammed (zandor vorkov) have devised a plan to take amir's dead body to america where mad scientist dr. lloyd trenton (kent taylor) will transplant his brain into a fresh body & with a bit of plastic surgery no-one will ever know he was even dead. things don't go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant amir's brain trenton's freak assistant gor (john bloom) brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony, trenton needed a strong fit living body & since there's no more time he decides to use gor's body as a temporary stop-gap until another more suitable one can be found. unfortunately when amir wakes up in his new body he's not very happy at what he sees, i mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak?<br /><br />also known as brain damage, the brain, the creature's revenege & the undying brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced & directed by the one & only al adamason & quite frankly i'm offended at the pathetic 1.5 rating brain of blood has on the imdb, personally i think it's terrific fun in a so bad it's good sort of way. the highly entertaining script by kane w. lynn & joe van rodgers is as loopy & silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists, from 7 foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to 4 foot tall midget medical assistant's, from basement dungeons to rooftop chases, from car crashes to assassination's, kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women, from regina carrol's hair-do which should get it's own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh-out-loud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech! it's all here & brain of blood has quality cheese stamped all over it, if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of 'must see' films. despite it's lowly 1.5 rating i am proud to admit that i liked brain of blood a lot, i thought it was an absolute hoot to watch, it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket, at only 85 minutes it's relatively short, it's difficult to second guess the barmy plot & i just think it's loads of campy fun.<br /><br />this is director adamson's masterpiece as far as i'm concerned along with dracula vs. frankenstein (1971) which he made a year before this. those who have seen an adamson film before will know about the none existent production values, cheap special effects & cardboard sets & that all adds to the fun, this film manages that fine between incompetence & seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience. i love the opening shot of kahlid which is obviously just a photo of the taj mahal in india complete with statuesque people in the foreground! regina carrol's hair seems to be a separate entity on it's own, it seems to change styles between shots & is frankly horrendous, don't get me started about her make-up job either that she must apply with a a paint sprayer! there is another hilarious moment when we see amir's body has been transported to america wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil, why is the question i asked myself, why!? the effects are variable, there's a terrible looking fake spider, gor's burned make-up job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressive.<br /><br />the budget for brain of blood must have been practically none existent, i must admit i thought trenton's lab was quite good with various computers & medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap & nasty. the production values are low, the music was taken from another film beast of blood (1971) & the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way.<br /><br />brain of blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever & as far as i'm concerned it's a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that i had a great time watching & laughing at. they just don't/can't/won't make them like this anymore, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it. i liked it, but then again i'm just weird.
