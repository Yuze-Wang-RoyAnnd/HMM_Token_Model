this movie has an outstanding acting, by marilia p^era, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine hector babenco. this is, in my opinion, the best brazilian movie ever made. the movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' , the brazilian ghetos. the children weren't actors and were casted by babenco in the city of rio de janeiro. the story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than alcatraz. the children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in brazil it does happen till today. a must see for those who like violent movies. but take your mother off the room, because it is a hard movie.
