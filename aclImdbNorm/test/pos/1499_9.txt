most of chaplin's most famous films are his full-length features. and, i assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre-feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. this is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century.<br /><br />if someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of chaplin's better shorts because chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. this is great for several reasons. first, in chaplin's earliest films from 1914-1915, his character of the little tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether. plus, even when he is there, he was often mean-spirited and self-centered--something very alien from the little tramp we have grown to love. second, because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition, if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't fit the action (a common problem).<br /><br />so, for a great look at chaplin's shorts at their finest, give this film a chance. it's sure to provide you some excellent laughs.
