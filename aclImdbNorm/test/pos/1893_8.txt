i was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. i must say, i was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. i was completely mistaken. this movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it i simply loved. bruce campbell was as amazing as ever. the biggest surprise was none other than ted raimi, you know, sam's little brother. he played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine. but i really cannot ignore the magic that is bruce campbell. though i did think that ted raimi stole the show, bruce did what he does best on the big screen. somewhere between the sketchy nasty american business man and the tragic victim, he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences. the movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. the crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took.<br /><br />this movie may not be oscar material, but my goodness, it was amazing. i would highly recommend this to any bruce campbell fan. also, anybody that likes campy sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch this. can't wait till this makes it out to dvd.<br /><br />take it as you want to....<br /><br />- the fed
