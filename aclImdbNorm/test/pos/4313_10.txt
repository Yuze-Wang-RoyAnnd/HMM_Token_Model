nobody (1999) is a fantastic piece of japanese noir. it's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three other guys one night in a bar. when these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally kill one of the other guys! the remaining two baddies then begin the systematic destruction of everything these poor schmoes hold dear, including their fast-dwindling sanity. phaedra video's dvd sleeve features a critic quote calling the film "a paranoid street crime freakout!" or some such, and the term more than applies here. brooding, tense, very violent and low-key (but still pretty slick), shot largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing right along with the besieged protagonists (who, to some degree, deserve everything they get!). i give it a 10.
