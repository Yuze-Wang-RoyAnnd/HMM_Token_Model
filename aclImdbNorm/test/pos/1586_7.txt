a kooky, but funny bit of diversion. you kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. it's fun to watch. sort of in the vein of red dwarf, but even more low budget. for someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died. also, the main guys are from the laundry corps, which is why they have laundry in everything. if you like red dwarf, you'll probably like this. slightly different t.v. concept, in that all you see is the commander's report each day.<br /><br />it would be better if this were explained more, not just in the very beginning of the first episode, but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in red dwarf too, if you hadn't been told.
