i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on pbs in 1983. i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the dell arte players, but bill irwin floored me.<br /><br />i was most impressed at how a man of his size (he's quite tall and beefy) could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise.<br /><br />most amazing for me, though, in this performance, was the way he rose to his feet during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo, he "pulled" himself up by the top of his head as if by a string, and rose not just to his feet, but to a full ballet point
