this was the best film i saw in the year 2000. the cohen brothers have never let me down before, and they certainly didn't this time either.<br /><br />it's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. i left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. of course, there's lot of cohen stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magic camerawork. but no cohen film is resembling any other cohen film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.<br /><br />the big surprise for me was that clooney is so good. but the true master performance in this movie comes from tim blake-nelson. but the rest of the cast is superb too.<br /><br />a film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. thats a very unlikely combination. but it's exactly what this picture is.
