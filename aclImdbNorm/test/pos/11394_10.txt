what has to change in today's attitude towards films like boogie nights is the approach. the approach is awful! comparing it to pulp fiction, seeing only the pornography, and all its aspects.. come on people, there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture. and to all the sceptics, hasn't paul thomas anderson proved himself worthy time and time again? magnolia is one of the main reasons i watch american films at all and still have faith in this "industry" that film-making is today.. and what about there will be blood? that is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not! yeah, you! the so-called consumer.. you know something: f#*k you! you don't deserve this, you don't deserve anything. so many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films, even mainstream, because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff.. like that sell-out britney spears.<br /><br />anyway, this was very painful for me to say because i don't want to see this, i don't wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers.. sales revenue and sales return.. i want to see magic, the magic that fellini, bergman and kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema.. because thats what pta is doing.. he is creating magic!!
