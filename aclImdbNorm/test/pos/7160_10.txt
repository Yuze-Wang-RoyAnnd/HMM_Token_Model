i agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. i saw this at the south by southwest film festival in austin. of the 20 films i saw,7 were really good and this was the best one for me. i'm a sucker for movies that have plot devices where characters go through transformations that totally change their lives. the excellent acting was mostly done by people involved in tv, or it was their first movie. it was written and directed by jay floyd. this was his debut as a director. jay's day job is apparently as a clearance administrator for lots of famous films. forgiving the franklins was a total delight and extremely funny in spots. this is one movie where i would buy the dvd and re-watch it, truly a high complement from me. well done, jay, yes...give up your day job!
