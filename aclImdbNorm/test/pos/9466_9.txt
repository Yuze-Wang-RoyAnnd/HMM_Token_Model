this film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. the strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of shakespeare. as joseph papp discovered back in the 1950s in central park, shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. and, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as twelfth night and a midsummer night's eve and as you like it are used to good effect in this film. all the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. and the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of bend it like beckham, another charming coming of age movie.
