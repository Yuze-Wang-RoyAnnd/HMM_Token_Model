a three stooges short, this one featuring shemp. of all those involving shemp i've seen, this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short. the basic plot is that shemp must get married by 6 o'clock that very evening if he's to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will. so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected, that is until they learn of his inheritance money. best bits here involve shemp shaving, shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp's voice-training session. also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious.
