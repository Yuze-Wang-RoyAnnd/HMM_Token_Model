francois truffaut, young jerk of the "cahiers du cinema", main bastion of the coming so-called new wave, made a big show of hating this film and even accused it of dragging french cinema into mediocrity. translation: truffaut, who was terminally repressed sexually, was already jealous of the way carn'e could make a huge success of a story that pushed all the right buttons of its audience and actually involved it into something important with all the trappings and seduction of sensuality. in other words, where the general public and many critics saw a perceptive sociological analysis wrapped in a beautiful film, truffaut saw "girls on the loose". <br /><br />carn'e, after all, had everything that would be severely lacking from the new wave: intelligence, refinement, humour, a great talent as a storyteller, a great ear for dialogue, dazzling technical brilliance, the capacity to make his actors do what he wanted them to do, and a good dose of good taste. by comparison, truffaut is a provincial bore with nothing to say.<br /><br />a 50's tragic remake of "pride and prejudice", the french answer to "rebel without a cause", an updated version of "children of paradise", "les tricheurs" tells a story of disaffected parisian youth who have lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values. some (young) critics perceived carn'e's take on the subject as the moralizing slant of an "older person", whereas i think what happened, quite to the contrary, is that carn'e being gay and knowing a thing or two about repression, felt an untold sympathy for the young iconoclasts in his story. furthermore, this being a french film, there is no mistaking that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that still had to be decoded in american films like "rebel without a cause" and "the wild one".<br /><br />carn'e's young people are all supremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. they are gods and goddesses. they drive the latest vespas and the right cars. the cut of their suits, dresses and duffle-coats was a high point of the fashions of the last century. their haircuts are still plastered on the wall of your local hairdresser. their body shape, which they attained and maintained without effort, is still the modern western ideal. they listen to the best jazz musicians. they know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love
