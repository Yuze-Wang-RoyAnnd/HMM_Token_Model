what a pleasure. this is really a parody. only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse. and as a result, you spend a really good time watching jean dujardin playing the dumb. most of the movie stands on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one. he has the perfect way of overdoing the james bond kind of guy that he is no match for mike meyers in austin powers for example. the dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the spectator, with a lot of stupid jokes, that's really perfect. both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character, and that was a challenge. there is no really plot in this movie, but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie. you just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes, and that's precisely what the movie manage to do. it deserves the success it has in france
