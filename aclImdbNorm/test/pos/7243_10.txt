i totally agree with the other poster. nemesis is one of the best of the christie adaptations with a superlative plot and cast.<br /><br />the scene involving liz fraser as the mother of the murder victim is a study in acting at the finest level. this underrated woman was a fave in brit films in the 1960s who never got a mainstream break in us films. check her out as julie andrews's friend in the 1964 the americanization of emily.<br /><br />all of the perfs in this prod have a chance to shine with and without the peerless ms. hickson who was never nommed for an emmy for her marple work. shame on them! and dig the lesbian cid agents! :)
