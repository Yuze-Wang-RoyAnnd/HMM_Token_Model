i really enjoy this film. it is a look back in time when this nation was truly at risk from nations who either attacked or delared war on us,i.e., the japanese and germans. robert cummings and pricilla lane were excellent in the lead roles. the supporting cast... otto kruger, alan baxter, clem bevins, and norman lloyd were also outstanding. the direction, pace, and finale held and continue to hold my interest. so much so, that i bought my own copy. thank goodness for turner classic movies, they show so many of the truly classic films, including this one.<br /><br />robert cummings was certainly no light weight as an actor and although i am a great fan of gary cooper and joel mccrea, two of my favorite actors, who were first offered the lead role, i don't see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed bob cummings' performance.<br /><br />this is a film that i enjoy watching repeatingly and urge others to view.
