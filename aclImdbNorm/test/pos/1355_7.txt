there is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says which may summarize all the film: "in italy it's the dead who rule". true! this is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. and bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. but foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed. i understand that australian or canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if there's a meaning--well, there's a meaning, but it's clear only to people who live here today, and keep their eyes wide open... like bellocchio. surely it's not one of his best films, and it's not as powerful as buongiorno, notte, but it's worth seeing... for italians who live in italy.
