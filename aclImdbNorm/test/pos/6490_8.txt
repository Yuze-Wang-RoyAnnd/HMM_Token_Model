i am a huge fan of the $5.50 dvd bin at my local walmart. hopefully you have one at your local branch. you can find a bunch of campy flicks, a bunch of trash, and the occasional surprise. this movie is one of the surprises. my friend recently bought this one, and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung-fu laugh riot, i was genuinely surprised at how good it was. i watch a lot of movies, and as a result, i can almost always call how a movie will turn out; and if there's a plot twist, what it will be. not this movie! the directing is brilliant, the plot is awesome, and the fighting is unbelievably inventive. if you see this one sitting around somewhere at a dirt-cheap price, get it! if you see it at full price, i would still recommend it.
