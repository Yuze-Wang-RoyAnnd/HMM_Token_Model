what is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge. recently, my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like "raging bull" or "raiders of the lost ark", but this time my vcr took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of lionel jeffries' "the railway children". this is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open fields of england, and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains. at first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on vhs rarity for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie
