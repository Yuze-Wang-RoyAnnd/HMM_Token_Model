this movie is kind of good. it seem that they used the tyrannosaurus rex like a blown up balloon, just like godzilla, just maybe back in those 60-70's days, scientist haven't got enough info. on all sorts of dinosaurs. back in those time scientist still making dinosaur, so i guess this movie was base on a tyrannosaurus rex movements back in the 60-70's. there even a part where a giant rock, fired by someone at the tyrannosaurus rex, it damage the tyrannosaurus rex and it was knock out for a little while. at the end, the tyrannosaurus rex went back to search for food. there is something wrong in the movie as well, like a rifle, how can one rifle kill a tyrannosaurus rex, when it could be 1,000-5,000 stronger than we are. if this film going to make a remake, i suggest make it more good and excited, because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it, if lucky.
