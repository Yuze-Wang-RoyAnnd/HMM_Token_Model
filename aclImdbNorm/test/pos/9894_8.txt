peter falk shines as 90 year old morris applebaum, the patriarch who has decided it's time to "check out" after holding a final, blow-out bash. his three children, lauran san giacomo, david paymer and judge reinhold are notified/invited by letter and immediately arrive on his doorstep to deal with their eccentric father. there is a great father/daughter chemistry with laura san giacomo, whose character happens to undergo the most growth from the ordeal. it's a well rounded example of your average, dysfunctional family and their memories, pains, growth and ignorance/tolerance of each others' lives. the musical score is one you'll enjoy and the one liners are well timed and hilarious. although i found the actual "checking out" party a let down, the rest of the film is sure to make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. move over "big fat greek wedding"....the "big fat jewish suicide" has arrived.
