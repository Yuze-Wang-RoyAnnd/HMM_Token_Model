this is possibly one of my favorite films. it tells the tale of a girl named gerda (chelsea hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. she falls in love with the bell boy named kai. however, on her birthday the snow queen (bridget fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps kai. gurda then goes after kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.<br /><br />i thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast. it has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow. i think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy. i have watched it every time t has been on since it came out and have never tired of it which is why i have given it a 10!
