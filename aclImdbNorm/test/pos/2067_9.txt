this is by far my favorite action movie. but what makes it work is not the elaborate renny harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. it's the shane black script and its deft delivery by geena davis and samuel l. jackson.<br /><br />the chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. thank god it was never made. too much danger of marring the original.<br /><br />'the long kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. never a dull moment. <br /><br />this has to be jackson's funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career. no quirky tarantino hit-man, super-cool shaft, or borderline psycho soldier. in tlkg, jackson is the everyman we identify with. the poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past.<br /><br />though the story claims that davis's character, samantha caine is suffering from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder.<br /><br />samantha caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac charly baltimore -- she is a separate, fully-developed personality. the traumas suffered by samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of charly to emerge again.<br /><br />the materials of her past life excavated by jackson's detective mitch henessey facilitate charly's resurfacing. good timing, too, considering the target samantha makes of herself.<br /><br />but charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality. one gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality (charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the "chapter".<br /><br />in the eight years charly was buried in the psyche, though, her samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (she's even funnier that charly.) this was probably due to becoming a mother, because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks charly's struggle to suppress samantha, leading to their apparent integration by movie's end.<br /><br />it's impossible to choose a "best quote" from this film:<br /><br />"now you're a sharpshooter?"<br /><br />"i saved your ass. it was great!"<br /><br />"continue dying. out."<br /><br />"i sock 'em in the jaw and yell 'pop goes the weasel'".<br /><br />and a couple of dozen more, many too raunchy to quote here.<br /><br />geena davis looks great, and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she's turning forty. (listen to charley's history, do the math).<br /><br />fantastic soundtrack, too. santana, muddy waters, elvis, labelle, marvin gaye. <br /><br />i give 'the long kiss goodnight' a 9, only because i don't believe in a perfect 10. seen it a dozen times, and it still stays fresh. nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to 'it's a wonderful life.'
