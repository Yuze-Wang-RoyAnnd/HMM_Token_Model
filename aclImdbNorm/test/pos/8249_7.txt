when pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer has found him a job working at a big city bank. when some of the crime underworld from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and rob the bank. pinky is at first horrified because he really wants to go straight, but when a twist of fate happens pinky begins to think one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.<br /><br />also known as the mayfair bank caper {amongst others!}, this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s. london and all it's highly dubious fashions are lit up like a christmas tree in ralph thomas and guy elmes' cunningly crafty caper. if the viewer can accept david niven as an aged crime lord of some evility {it's not easy i can tell you}, then a nightingale sang in berkeley square could well surprise you. the actors aren't pulling up any trees for sure, but it's really not hurting the picture at all, it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining. the score and soundtrack is perhaps guilty of over jollification during the dramatic criminal moments, but it's a minor complaint to leave me thinking this is an under seen british gem.<br /><br />richard jordan takes the lead role of pinky (obviously hoping to lure in american viewers}, 70s heart throb oliver tobias {a mass of hair} is in there to keep the ladies interested, whilst the blokes get the pleasurable sight of elke sommer and her delightful legs for company. moving along at a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale, a nightingale sang in berkeley square deserves far better than the paltry 5.7 rating here on imdb, but just how many people have seen it i wonder?, hmm, go on give it a go if you the chance, it's good stuff. 7/10
