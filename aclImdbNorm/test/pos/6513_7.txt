"miss cast away" is an amusing trifle, which dispenses with serious plot or character development to pack in as many gags as possible. best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps, has had a few drinks. most of the jokes are current-event based so in future years this film may become a time-capsule of turn-of-the-21st-century pop culture references.<br /><br />the 30i to 24p conversion of the footage does create a jerky appearance in some parts, most noticeably the opening aerial shots.<br /><br />the appearance of micheal jackson is indeed a strange non-sequiter event. but i, for one, find it encouraging that mr. jackson has shown a helpful interest in one of his prot'eg'es even after he (the director) has passed from the cute-preteen-boy stage.<br /><br />the effects work is not as bad as one review suggested. most of it was done by a one-man crew in a brief span of time consisting of animator william sutton, whose name seems to have been omitted from the imdb credits. his work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this movie. i hope he's finally been paid!
