a suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet (sadly none have persued a career). <br /><br />also features the the god-like ability of christopher nolan to write perfect dialogue. dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books. well shot, very well edited, even better written, and amazingly well performed.<br /><br />this movie has everything a great film needs, except people who have seen it. 9/10
