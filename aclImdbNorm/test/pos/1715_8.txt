one of the most successful shows in television history is back. now i admit i never got into the original show.... okay, so i never watched it at all. but the new show is impressive.<br /><br />sci-fi has premiered the first two episodes, "rose" and "the end of the world," this weekend. we meet rose, a twenty-something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins. she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor. using the internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes, death follows. when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an impostor, the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters, whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time, traveling in a tardis disguised a 50s-style police call box.<br /><br />she helps him save the world--there wouldn't be a show otherwise--and decides to join him. but when he puts her life in danger, he is distraught, and questions whether her company was worth the risk.<br /><br />although the special effects are kinda lame, and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy, "doctor who" is (after two episodes aired in the us) a smart, well-written work. apparently, the second season has already aired in the uk, so i predict the same success here.
