for me, pink flamingos lived up to it's reputation as being the shocking, disgusting, repulsive, trashy film i was expecting it to be, that really contains everything but the kitchen sink. we are treated to almost two hours of nastiness that never lets up: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism, and a horrid display of singing out ones anus. it is about a strange couple who begin a competition with a trailer trash family, trying to steal their title as the "filthiest people alive". divine (a fat guy in drag) is an unbelievably vile human being, who actually becomes painful to watch. trust me when i say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten, especially the end scene in which divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk. i have always thought john waters was over-rated and i cannot say i like this film, but it is an experience if you ever get a chance to see it.
