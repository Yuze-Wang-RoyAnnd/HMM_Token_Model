normally i hate period films. living in england is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas - which i do. however this one is the best. it doesn't take itself seriously and jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are great together, liv tyler's good as well although her english accent is dodgy!!<br /><br />the film has everything for someone who just wants to go the cinema to enjoy themselves. it has action, adventure, drama and comedy. i'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will. it would be a shame for american audiences to miss out on this film. it shows that english film-makers can produce something that doesn't involve constant swearing and sex. both do feature in this but in a balanced format. iain robertson's camp portrayal of the well to do gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class set are hilarious!<br /><br />as the trailer for 'the spy who shagged me' is pupported to say...."if you see one other film"....this spring make it plunkett and macleane. it's got fun, action lurve and of course, jonny lee miller with an english accent for a change!
