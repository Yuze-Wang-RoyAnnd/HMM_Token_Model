i'd buy that for a dollar!!!<br /><br />i did buy this film for a dollar and i've seen much worse for much more!!<br /><br />this is a scottish sci-fi film from mark stirton and according to the making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $8000. eight grand!!! that wouldn't pay for half a minute in hollywood!! nevertheless ---- this is top fun film making. if you like things gritty then you're in for a treat. these are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing. i didn't mind, but my girl friend did!! the actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see people that i've never heard of or seen before. it meant i had no idea who was going to die first.<br /><br />if you watch a movie for it's 'latest of the latest' visual effects then watch a star wars. the effects here are ok, but kinda weak in space. but the monsters are very well done if a bit pred like.<br /><br />stirton does an amazing job with not very much and i'd love to see his take on a real hollywood movie. it least it wasn't predictable and i almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off!!! ok, so it is a little derivative of other sci-fi, but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a sci-fi film for 8 g's is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry.<br /><br />good marks for a good film, extra marks for working so hard, extra extra marks for a really interesting making of. no standard bull here, all the problems of production are gone into making it like lost in mancha only with a film at the end. but why no commentary? keep going scots!
