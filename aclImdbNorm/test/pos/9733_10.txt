first off, i hate sci fi stuff, and although this movie got a little sci fi at times, that's allright, because at least it focused on andre toulon. in the last 3, andre seemed to have kind of been mentioned, but the stories never really focused on him, which made me mad. what also makes me mad is the amount of 0's it got on the voting chart. give it a rest people. if you saw this movie and liked it, please vote for it. please. what i loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all started. when andre first learned the secret to life. i would recommend renting this if you have seen a puppet master movie before and liked it. but not renting it if this is your first time viewing one from the pm collection, mainly because you might think all the puppet masters are as "dull" as this one.
