15 park avenue is the address "mithi/mithali" (konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. "prof.anu" (shabhana azmi)is mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from mithi's mom's earlier marriage. the movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (mithi). the director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of mithi, through her continuous blabbering to anu and others. <br /><br />konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which i am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of mithi in this movie. you can see the look of a patient written on her face, by the drooping lips and sleepy eyes, from the first scene itself. rahul bose has done a good job, but has been reduced to one half of the movie in spite of his importance in their life.<br /><br />watch out for the intense relationships shown between the characters of the movie, mithi & anu, anu & anu's mom and between anu & sanjiv (kanwaljit singh). shabhana azmi, as usual has done a riveting performance to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for mithi.<br /><br />the movie might not be your usual hindi potboiler, but can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a different light altogether.<br /><br />as usual, aparna sen brings the movie to a different ending rather than any clich'ed ones, we might think off. hats off to her, for this great movie!!!
