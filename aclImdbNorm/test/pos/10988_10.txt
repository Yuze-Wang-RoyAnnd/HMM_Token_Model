what a great cast for this movie. the timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines-several times i was still laughing minutes after they were delivered. i found manna from heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things i was thinking would happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. this movie is about hope and righting wrongs. i left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. bravo to the five sisters.
