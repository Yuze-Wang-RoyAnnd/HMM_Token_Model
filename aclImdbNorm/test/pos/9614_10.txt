released as king boxer in the u.k.<br /><br />this film was essentially the first kung fu film to go on general release in the u.k. many of us had ratcheted through kurosawa's astonishingly gritty and involving dramas and were used to oriental film being beautifully shot and lit, with somewhat restrained pacing, all in all like leafing through an album of very fine still photographs that just happened to be moving.<br /><br />along come run run shaw and co. with their widescreen "home movie" production values, and astonishing ripe-for-parody dubbing and all the rules have changed. king boxer was the first in through the door, leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the blazed footsteps.<br /><br />in spite of hokey plots, pantomime acting, cheesy jump-cuts and spaghetti western style snap-stepped zooms, this film was marvellous. gorgeous without being opulent and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever to grace a screen. we loved the sickening violence, the anguish, the testosterone. the martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating, if flamboyant and oftentimes silly. it was so very different from the japanese stuff we all knew, and it had lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickening violence and bloodstained floors. delightful.<br /><br />the "king lear" scene was, at the time, quite a milestone in schlock "you cruel bastards.. my **** !!" now it's rather less shocking, but still a bit of a gut-churner<br /><br />we didn't notice that any females in sight were absolutely one-dimensional. after seeing more films of the genre, it now stands out like a sore thumb, but at the time it didn't matter<br /><br />this film defined what would rapidly become the kung-fu movie clich'es. all of them. watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens, there was no genre for it to slot into. it was unique and awesome. it was the first kung fu movie and it still is, for me and many others, the best.
