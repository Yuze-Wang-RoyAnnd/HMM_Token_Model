this is my all time favourite movie ever!!!<br /><br />i remember seeing this when i was younger and since then i have been in love with it. i used to rent it so often from this one video store that used to carry it, and when we moved i couldn't find it any where so i kep going back tot he far away store just so i could watch the movie again!<br /><br />finally i found it for sale and i bought it and watched it over and over again.... great movie!<br /><br />since then though it was my very first dvd that i got after i got my dvd player... ok well i got them at the same time, the quality on the dvd is way better i couldn't believe it! you gotta see this one!
