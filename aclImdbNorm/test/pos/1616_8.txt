i bought this dvd from walmart for cheap, thinking it would be a typical, crap straight-to-video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. there isn't really any criticism to say about it... it's obviously low budget, but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun. it's very cool and entertaining.<br /><br />there's everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. and i'd say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come off as any other movie i've seen. it has it's own unique look, which i liked very much, that's why this film deserves credit. i look forward to seeing more of these awesome movies from "the scare master", brett piper, whom i've never heard before this one.<br /><br />the dvd menu is really creative with groovy music playing over it, so it's perfect just to keep it on when you're not yet ready to sit down and watch it. it also includes some special features, which are really interesting. but we never get to see the director or hear him in the commentary, must be shy. this comes out of edgewood studios in vermont, usa. i highly recommend it to all horror buffs, you'll love it!
