i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years-old (you do the math). i absolutely loved it. i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert (keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time i saw that film, until about a month ago. it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9:00 am, i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid. <br /><br />upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that andie macdowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. ian holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan. he was great! the depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.<br /><br />as i stated earlier i am lambert fan, but i'm used to highlander, the hunted and fortress. in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.<br /><br />so to make a short story way too long, i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.
