this is actually great fun. i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together!. all the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this!. rene russo is excellent in her role, and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout (especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny glover's lines), plus the finale is just great. yes it's just another run of the mil "buddy buddy" cop film, but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy!, plus it had some great car chase scenes as well!. it's nothing that great really, however i found it to be great fun, and a perfect way to pass the time!,however the main villain was very weak and wasn't very good at all. this is far from being the best "buddy "buddy" cop film, however it's still a very entertaining one, and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well!, plus the ending was quite funny!. this is actually great fun, i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robrt de niro and eddie murphy were great together, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. tom dey does a very good job here with great camera work, cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. the acting is a lot of fun!. robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, very likable, had fantastic chemistry with eddie murhpy did his usual awesome stuff, pulled some really funny faces, seemed to be enjoying himself,had some funny lines, and had a really cool character! (de niro rules!!!!!!!). eddie murphy is also amazing here, he is hilarious, like de niro did his usual funny stuff, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch! (murphy rules!!!!). rene russo is fantastic here!, she had a cool character, and while she didn't have much to do, she added a lot of screen presence, and made her character interesting always, she was just great! (russo rules!!!!). william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didn't overdo it, and brought some good laughs into the film. the main villain is ok, but kind of weak and rather bland, still he did what he had to do adequately. rest of the cast do fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5
