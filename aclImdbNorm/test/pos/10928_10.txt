i had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the miami film festival this past saturday and let me just say i was astounded. it was the only film out of the whole program that i loved. it is beautifully shot, composed, edited, acted and written. after the screening i saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next. he said that he was working on finding financing for the feature version of the short. he described some scenes to me. it sounded like the kind of first film that launches the greats into the industry. if you ever get a chance to see this short i highly recommend taking it. hats off to star crossed.
