i originally posted the first user comment on this movie,and claimed it was crap and it didnt make sense.i didnt make sense. campfire tales is a thoroughly enjoying film (now that im 2 years older and watched it last night).the actors were famous but not too famous. the acting itself was more than acceptable,it was rather good.i will rate the movie per segment of films.<br /><br />1)the black and white scene (a.k.a-"the hook") this one was rather pointless,it looked good,but didnt hold much grip at all,the only disappointing one,i dont think it was even included as a segment.here is the scare-o-meter.<br /><br />------(poor)<br /><br />2)the r.v story (honeymooners stuck in woods) possibly the most entertaining of all tales,the acting was good in this one too,dissapointing bout the typical caravan sex scenes.yet it was intruiging,you think "who was knocking on that door".it had suspense,and not too gory.liked this one<br /><br />--------------------------(very good)<br /><br />3)internet chat tale (little girl meets psycho) this was a smart addition,gore left at a minimal,frights left at extreme.although dull at times,the last few minutes were most entertaining,dont get me wrong it was still fun to watch.real creepy,and could happen to anybody,so watch who youre talking to.<br /><br />---------------------------(very good)<br /><br />4)ghost tale (man kisses ghost)?? not the best,it wasnt too atmospheric for a ghost tale.this one was strange,the aspects were rather good,playing music and the screaming,but everything was too real to be ghastly,although it was good,it was quiet bloody,and could have been better with that idea.<br /><br />-------------(acceptable)<br /><br />5)the ending (the 4 lost teenagers) these are the 2 attractive gals and guys telling the tales through-out the film.the best thing about the film is definantley the ending,it set a great impression,the ending was totally un-expected.watch it,it was so well done,the realism was spectacular.<br /><br />-----------------------------------(top notch)<br /><br />6)the film overall campfire tales was more than i used to take it for,i actually like it so much now im buying it on video,cause its a truly entertaining horror movie forget the trash you see these days,like many,im dissapointed that this didnt really go nowhere,it was straight to video,to me it was better than all the hype "horror" you see these days. overall for campfire tales<br /><br />----------------------------- (very good)<br /><br />8 out of 10
