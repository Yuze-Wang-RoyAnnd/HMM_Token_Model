ok so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but over all an interesting idea which works towards a tight ending. the acting is solid particularly lachy hulme who plays one of the central characters in this ensemble piece. he certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch. it has a low budget feel which works for the sort of thriller/horror genre four jacks belongs to. the film doesn't try to take itself to seriously which adds to the overall charm. the character of phil(dave serrafin) has to be one of the most annoying character seen on screen since rupert pupkin/ king of comedy. worth adding to a weekend pile of dvds.
