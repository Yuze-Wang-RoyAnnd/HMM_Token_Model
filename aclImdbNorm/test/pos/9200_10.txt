i don't usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas.<br /><br />naturally here in the uk we are about 2/3rd's through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3 ( via other means ) i'm still glued every friday at 9pm.<br /><br />from the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on dvd, yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in october.<br /><br />so why do i love this show so much, well i have to agree with the last poster.... james caan, i know one person cannot make a team but big ed deline was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around, i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed deline.... do'h no way!!! i also agree that caan's character is getting very soft, i also preferred the tough take no sh*t big bad eddy d that we saw in season 1 & 2, he seems to have mellowed out.<br /><br />as i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members josh duhamel/danny, james lesure/mike, vanessa marcil/sam, nikki cox/mary, molly sims/delinda all contribute well, even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian deline, harry groener as gunther, dean caine as casey, mitchell longley as mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one.<br /><br />this show has everything, drama, action, suspense, laughs, romance, glitz's, glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's.<br /><br />many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season 4.
