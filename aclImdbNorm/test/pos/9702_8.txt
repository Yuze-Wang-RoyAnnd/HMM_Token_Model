my sister, a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the 24th of september. we had all seen the first "jackass" movie a while back, and we all enjoyed it. we were really looking forward to number two.<br /><br />we were not disappointed.<br /><br />from start to finish i was laughing hysterically. it is equal parts shocking and amusing, however, and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches. it is obscene, but it is also groundbreaking american cinema... well, perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their scrotum's stuck to ice sculptures, but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not, things that no other "decent" american movie released nation-wide would dare show us.<br /><br />there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene, and it involved a horse - i'll not elaborate.<br /><br />i laughed, i nearly gagged, and i came damn-close to crying (out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball, not sadness). in my humble opinion, "jackass: number two" is the film of '06.<br /><br />does that make me a jackass? perhaps. but if it does, i could really care less.
