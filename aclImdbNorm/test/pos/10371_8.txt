i saw this film on the a&e channel this past weekend. the mystery was okay, i was not able to guess the culprit before the end. but i enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery. there was a mystery about some of them, especially george abernathie, performed by the wonderful michael fassbender, and george's cousin, susannah. in fact, the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more. from what i've tried to glee about the agatha christie book of the same title, i think this film did not follow it to the letter. very good performances by the actors involved, especially fassbender and the lady who played cora/companion.
