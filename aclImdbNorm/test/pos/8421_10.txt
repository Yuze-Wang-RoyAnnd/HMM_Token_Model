this is a film about a six year old child from a village in maharashtra (a state in india) and his grandfather who come to pune (a city in maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. here the grandfather gets to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they have to be removed to save the child's life. the movie is all about the main characters' and their feelings and actions until the operation.<br /><br />the movie is not a typical clich'e indian movie, so dun expect to see songs or romance or melodrama. this ia a supremely crafted sensitive movie which resorts to silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get the point thru. witness the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes. the acting is superb, dialogs heart breaking. your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation. <br /><br />the handling of the subject has been excellent. the film was made under great hardship by the director, sandeep sawant who had to knock many doors to gather the rs. six million (approx. $130000) budget. even then the final product seems polished and has decent production values. also witness the subtle city village contrast shown by the director by incorporating some random shots of the boy's life in the village. sawant definitely seems to prefer village life.<br /><br />the acting by all is excellent. amruta subhash as the social worker is competent adding the required humane touch to her role. sandeep kulkarni as the docter is great, showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor. ashwin chitale as the child is a natural. he doesn't seem to be acting. everything about him is natural and does not seem forced.<br /><br />but towering above all is arun nalawade as the grandfather. he is astounding in his role. mere words cannot describe his work. it is a performance to cherish forever.<br /><br />shwaas is a sincere effort to make good cinema. it should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple, the the results can be really surprising. 10/10.
