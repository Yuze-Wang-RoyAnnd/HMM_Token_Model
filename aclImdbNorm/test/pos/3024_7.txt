i remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. i never got the chance to see it though. when i went to blockbuster to rent some videos, i figured i should watch it. after all i did love "silence of the lambs" and "se7en", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of "the cell". the whole story concept is very interesting. going physically into the mind of a killer, i can't imagine the world they live in. the acting is actually pretty decent. jennifer lopez is the only one i have to say that wasn't that great, but she does a believable job. i would recommend for a scary thriller.<br /><br />7/10
