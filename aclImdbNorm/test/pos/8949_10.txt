this movie is one of the funniest i have seen in years. a movie which deals with death and funerals without being depressing, or irreverant. christopher walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and i could hardly breathe for laughing so hard.<br /><br />i saw the movie a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but cheered. i am telling all my friends to watch for it's arrival in the usa. i definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and purchasing it on dvd as soon as it's available.
