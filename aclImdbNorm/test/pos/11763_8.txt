if it wasn't meant to be a comedy, the filmmakers sure goofed. if they intended for it to be a comedy, they hit the mark. our critic says homegrown is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit, recommends it for all audiences, and says that he really liked jamie lee curtis's performance. it deserves a theatrical re-release.
