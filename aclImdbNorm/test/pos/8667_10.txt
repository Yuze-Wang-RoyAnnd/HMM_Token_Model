as you may know norway is the most developed country in the world (regarding to hdi; human development index). this film craftily reveal our future to us. our future would be that of norway since we are all paddling to achieve the best and offer the least. the life that was shown was maybe an exaggeration, yet comparing today's concerns with those of our ancestors it is not far-from-reality reasoning.<br /><br />watching this film free from all of our pre-assumptions, we can find both of our faces; the one that is laughing at the brilliant scene of andreas dumping her girlfriend and the one that is searching through magazines hours and hours to choose some stupid chair among stupid collections.<br /><br />the idea of the hole with the hope of lightness was another magnificent idea of the film. the slight glory; yet the only one, and the effort that was put to reach it makes us feel closer to andreas.<br /><br />although i was attracted mostly to the idea and production of the film, trond fausa aurvaag played pretty well and the atmosphere of the film was quite matchable.
