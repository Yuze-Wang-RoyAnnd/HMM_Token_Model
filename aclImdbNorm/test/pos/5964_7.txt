the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz's most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i've ever seen. the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers. jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork. neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures! the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives! like i said, this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children. in fact, i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla. that alone should tell you what to expect here!
