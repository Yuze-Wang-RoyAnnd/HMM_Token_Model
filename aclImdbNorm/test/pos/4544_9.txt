this movie probably isn't the funniest i've ever seen, and it certainly doesn't have much redeeming value. in fact, it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot. however, this "make-it-up-as-i-go-along" attitude actually works to the film's advantage. "tommy boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the snl skits farley and spade starred in succeeded: their well-timed extemporaneous silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity.
