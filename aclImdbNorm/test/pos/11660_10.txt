one of the best ever. direction, fotography, a thrilling and dramatic history, wonderful soundtrack and, most of all, the incredible credibility of susan sarandon and sean penn, the best and most underestimated "under-40 generation" actor. after seeing this movie i guess if there's anyone who couldn't have any doubt about giving death to another man, in spite of the ugly things he could have done?
