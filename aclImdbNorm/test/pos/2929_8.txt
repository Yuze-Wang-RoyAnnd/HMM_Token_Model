this was another great episode from season 11 of south park. <br /><br />cartman fakes having tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. he is able to swear at the other kids at school. kyle tells the principal that cartman is faking it. but, she doesn't believe it. chris hansen is planning on having cartman to be on dateline to talk about tourette syndrome live and uncensored. but later on, cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff. this was a funny episode about cartman faking tourette syndrome. i recommend it to any south park fan.
