better than the original, "the gamers: dorkness rising" manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting, fine special effects, and comedy that transcends the "gamer" knowledge-base and do so on a low budget. i've seen many low-budget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high-budget counterparts. this film blows most mainstream movies away! parts are a bit weak (the bit with the pirates and ninjas -while funny- goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit) but, overall, this is a very strong film.<br /><br />i'm very happy to say that i bought this film as soon as i saw it and brought it home.<br /><br />any chance we can look forward to another feature gamers movie from these guys? :)
