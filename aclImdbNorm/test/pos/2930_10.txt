this is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the season 11 episodes (with the exception of the imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of season 11. so basically cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to cartman. you can imagine, now cartman has tourette's syndrome and is great since kyle once he knows about this is like "he's faking". cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody. on the other hand we have kyle who now is the intolerant one, basically for saying that cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with tourette's syndrome just to let him see that tourette's syndrome is for real and is great since kyle is like "well maybe someone is faking to have tourette's for fun", in short kyle could not explain that cartman was faking. probably my favourite scene of this episode is when cartman is with kyle's family but right after this scene another kid fins that cartman is simply faking, the kid with tourette's who was at the toy store, cartman basically said to that kid this: "isn't having tourette's awesome". but to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for cartman, his master plan: going on national tv to say anything he wants ("people will call it brilliant tv, they'll probably give me an emmy"- fantastic, in this episode the word "s***" is used 26 times and certainly that's not all. south park won an emmy like a month or so before this episode aired). but here there's a twist, cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall, he says now everything without thinking so we hear from cartman that he wet his bed last night, now is not fun for cartman and he is like "i can't control what i say" and certainly the person who was with him is like "well of course you can't control what you say, you have tourette's" so cartman is like "my tourette's has gotten worse, before i just blurted out cool stuff about jews being lame and stuff but now it's gotten really bad". there is also stuff about chris hansen and to catch a predator, actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts, kyle and thomas were behind that to stop cartman, kyle ends being cartman's saviour! fantastic!<br /><br />tsa voices concern over "south park" october 3rd episode <br /><br />on wednesday, october 3, the cable network comedy central will air an episode of the animated series "south park" in which one of the young characters, cartman, "gets" tourette syndrome. given the nature of this program, we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with ts and garner numerous calls and emails from our members and the ts community.<br /><br />we have already taken some pre-emptive strikes, such as requesting that comedy central air our public service announcement (featuring comedian richard lewis) during or after the show. in addition, once the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how ts is portrayed, we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writers.<br /><br />"we are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use ts as comedy fodder in this program, since no disability, illness or controversial topic is off limits to them," said judit ungar, president, tsa.<br /><br />"we always see portrayals of ts (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for tsa to spread factual information about the disorder," said tracy colletti- flynn, manager of public relations and communications, tsa.<br /><br />we will be posting an official statement on this site with tsa's reaction to the program after the show airs.<br /><br />tsa responds to "south park" episode <br /><br />unfortunately, as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with tourette syndrome (ts), the season opener of south park ("le petit tourette," 10-3-07) served to perpetuate even further the outright myth that most of those affected by ts have involuntary outbursts of foul language. in point of fact, fully 85-90% of people with ts never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically termed coprolalia). for viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the misleading take away message couldn't have been clearer
