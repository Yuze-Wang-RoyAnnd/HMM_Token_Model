this film is a powerful commentary on family life in north america today. the story is so well constructed, it almost feels like its happening across the street, right now! if you are connected with your family and community in any way, this film will grab you and transport you to the travis' home and not allow you to leave until the credits are done.<br /><br />our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often unwittingly, lead us down a path of sorrow, confusion and isolation. the travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invite each of us; father, mother, brother and sister, into their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just doesn't quit. we see all of the above and eventually the joy, in powerful performances by the major players and the rest of the cast, making this film a movie-goers absolute treasure.<br /><br />in a film so well done as this, it is usually difficult to to find something special, but sigourney weaver's portrayal of sandy travis was outstanding. i would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such.<br /><br />clearly a 10. well done!
