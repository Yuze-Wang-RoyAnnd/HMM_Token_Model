i've heard about this documentary for so long i knew i needed to take the time to watch it. as a documentary it's very well done, in that it takes a neutral observant view of their experience. there are no voice-overs, or interviewing. it is honest. it is true. it is also humbling. two comments really stayed with me after the film was done. one was how the boys are told to not to become like the american boys who wear the baggy pants, and how in africa there is time but no money, but in america there is money but no time. the biggest impact was how the boys hungered for education, and how one of the boys totally relocated himself so he could go to school. i watched this film with a high school sophomore who said it upset him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real orientation to america. he also said he knew so many american teens who simply cannot appreciate howblessed their lives are in america. i would agree with him on both accounts. a strong film that will leave a person thinking about many things.
