i can't believe i missed this one. made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a tv soap, this is 90 minutes of sustained, sharp as a knife film making. you will find the outline, plot etc elsewhere on this site.consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single, hand- held,16mm camera... all the dialogue is improvised... none of the 'actors' had appeared in front of a camera before... it sounds like a recipe for disaster. instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the california desert in what evolves into a 'that's not fair.. i'm on that person's side'scenario. the only problem is, the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of 90 minutes we're still not sure who has one. brilliant... quite brilliant.
