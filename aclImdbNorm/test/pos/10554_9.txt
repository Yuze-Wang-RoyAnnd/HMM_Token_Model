my father the hero is sweet, funny and cute. gerard depardiu is awesome as andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen year old daughter nicole(kathrine heigl) to the caribbean for vacation.while there, his daughter meets a guy named ben(dalton james. to impress him, she tells him that andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her pimp. everyone on the island is soon under the impression that andre's a child molester. andre is between two relationships. one with isabelle(emma thompson, who makes a cameo in the end of the film) and diana(faith prince from spin city). my father the hero has many funny moments. like when he's at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french. so he plays "thank heaven for little girls" from gigi. everyone gets disgusted and leaves. my father the hero doesn't deserve a 5.1. i think it deserves a 9.0.
