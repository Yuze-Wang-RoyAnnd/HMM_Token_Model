when i was 10 (currently 14), i vowed to never see a movie that i knew would not have a happy ending. and until a few weeks ago i had done pretty well, except for shakespere for english class...etc...i was still only watching things that ended happy. but then i saw ramola garai in havanah nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. after seeing this a few times over the two or so years since i first saw it, i grew to like it, especially the music. so i did a search on her and found imdb...i saw "inside i'm dancing" and assumed she had done another dancing movie, and over looked it. it was later on an image search(of rory, looking for gilmore girls poster for locker) i picked up an image from this movie...i then searched for a trailer, i found the trailer and when i saw the hospital and heard rory say "you've got the future" i remembered my vow and realized this would not be a good movie for me. but it just stayed in the back of my mind until we were at the video store and there it was for $5 used, so i went ahead and bought it. after seeing it i just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad. i still wouldn't go near it until i had cerebral palsy as a vocab word. then i just had to see it again and this time all i did was laugh, even at the saddest parts i no longer felt depressed because i realized that over all this movie was happy and uplifting...i love it and it is now one of my favorites, i;m sure this is the worst comment you have ever read. but watch the movie it's worth it.
