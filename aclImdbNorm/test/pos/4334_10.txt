the movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. the lines in the movie are great, such as "nothings to good for out friends" and "its collection time charlie collection time." i can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. i feel that when i watch this movie i want to go out and shoot down bad guys, if there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one. "they killed the giggler man, they killed the giggler" "they had no right in doing that, hes on our turf ill take care of it." the lines just keep on coming in the movie. deff. go out and not rent but buy this movie its worth the money trust me.
