i have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie, and i understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about ponyo, whether it be the story line, animation, dialogue, and so forth. and i believe the most simple way i can answer to this, is that it's a movie for a much, much younger age bracket. an age bracket much younger than that of tonarino totoro (my neighbor totoro).<br /><br />being a miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site, i expected the wonderful animation, music composition, complex story telling, the great steady development of characters, how the story intertwines with today's society, etc etc etc of a typical miyazaki film that we grew up with. and to tell you the truth, i didn't quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes left in the movie), that this movie is not for the deep thinkers and hard core ghibli-ists, but for the toddlers and youngins' and happy go lucky japanese people. also, i believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation; straight-up grass roots ghibli studios style. <br /><br />the fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, other than the father and maybe that crazy-ass typhoon. but other than that, this movie is just plain fun; to stimulate a young one's mind, and to make happy good time feeling. that's all. <br /><br />the animation goes back to the old-school mid-80s early-90s era of miyazaki's films, where very specific detail wasn't a big focus, unlike mononoke hime (princess mononoke) and the latter. i admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when i first watched ghibli movies like tonarino totoro when i was a child. the reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids, and a lot of studio ghibli's body language is very noticeable. studio ghibli added some creative moments and sceneries that they can only do with it's wonderful animators, but it probably won't take the ritual ghibli-ist in awe.<br /><br />the japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very, very relative from what japanese kids and mothers would say and act. the music if very hoppy and "fluffy" i guess you could say (similar to totoro) from beginning to end. even the darker scenes didn't seem assertive.<br /><br />in the end this movie is one of a kind. just about every aspect of this movie is for children. and i waited a whole 80 mins to realize that. quite frankly, i have never seen a movie told or shown it the way miyazaki did. it's refreshing to see that studio ghibli can still tell a story for a wider, and much different scale of audience, and still keep that trademark ghibli impression.
