i found this movie to be filled with irony. but watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen. leila is a confused, bored house wife, who is constantly looking for happiness. when she thinks she finds true happiness, she clings onto it, leaving behind all that she knew. but she finds her self almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. she learned that if she only had communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, that it could have been salvaged a lot easier that she intended it to be. she realizes that words are nothing with out action, but she learns that too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change once again. the main conflict in this movie, is leila vs herself. you can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy. i liked this movie, but i would only recommend this movie to women, i can't see a man truly finding enjoyment in this movie.
