i was very excited to see rock star because i am a big fan of mark wahlberg's. i was surprised to have liked it more than i originally thought i would. the script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. there were a few moments when visions of spinal tap came rushing back, and i can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. but, i digress.<br /><br />wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. he does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him, but also make you really care about his character.<br /><br />jennifer aniston, who hasn't impressed me in movies up to this point, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend/manager. she shows more real emotion than i've seen in her last few movies combined.<br /><br />but above all, it's the music in this movie that really draws you in. peppered with some 80's tunes (let's face it - bon jovi would have any 80's music fans rocking in their seat), the movie really rocks with the original steel dragon songs and wahlberg's performance of them.<br /><br />i plan to see this movie again, but first i'm going to rush out and buy the soundtrack!
