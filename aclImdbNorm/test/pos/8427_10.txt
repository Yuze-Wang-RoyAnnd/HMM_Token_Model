i finally found a version of persuasion that i like! anne doesn't look like a scullery maid in this version, just a very thin, aging, pretty woman, quite like she's described in the book. captain wentworth doesn't look like he's 50, nor does he look perpetually angry but rather, as he's described in the book, he hasn't aged as much as anne and is quite handsome. and they play their parts with such conviction and realism...that's what acting is all about. they were believable. they created real characters, and it was like the characters in the book came to life. if you haven't seen this version, i urge you to find it, order it or request it from either a bookstore, or a library if you must. it's worth the price and worth the wait. <br /><br />i watched the 1995 version, and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two. why it isn't rated higher is beyond my comprehension. the book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life.
