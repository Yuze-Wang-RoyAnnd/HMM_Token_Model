this film promises much but delivers little. the basic problem has to do with the inclusion of charlotte gainsbourg's character in this film. immigrants from sicily did not need a redheaded anglo in any way--the movie may have needed her, but new citizens certainly did not. in my opinion,the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. this is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie, but also the history of immigration itself. immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what i believer to be a veiled image of "the white man's burden." i wonder if someone will make a movie of irish immigrants which will include a sicilian woman as a major character. the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film--acting, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, plot, and character development--on a scale from high of 10 for excellent, 5 for average, and 1 for needs help. both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. the continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of marc chagall? the plot is simple enough, until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship, and too much emphasis on the ending. the acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the anglo-saxon speaking perfect english almost turns the movie into a satire. where's groucho when you need him? the production sets, the dialogue and the artistry are very good, each rating a 10. the sets in sicily, on the ship, and on ellis island are as good as one can find. the dialogue is marvelous, and the ethic singing is superb. i agree with scorsese that listening to the sicilian dialect is a pleasure. note that the immigrants speak of "america", not the "united states"--the ideal vs. the political reality. the are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of america, gold coins raining, and giant veggies among the best. the average left elbow index is 5.25, raised to a 7.0 when equated with the imdb scale. one other notion seems to run through ellis island experience: the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling, later, in 2006, one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night, no questions asked! the movie is worth seeing, but it appears that what one sees is problematical.
