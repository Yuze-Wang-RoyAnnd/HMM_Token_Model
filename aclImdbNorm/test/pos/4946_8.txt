compared to the competition, soul calibur 3 is a god amongst games- a true piece of art. however, compared to its 128 bit predecessors, the latest in namcos superior slash em up series is over ambitious- its attempts to improve on perfection isn't quite successful.<br /><br />there are new modes and game play tweaks that i commend for trying to elevate the series to new heights-but they just complicate things . examples? well, the character creation mode is a great idea in theory, but in actuality is full of restrictions and is no way as customisable as that found in the wwe games for example. the chronicles of the sword mode is fun and thought provoking for a little while but eventually drags on and feelslike a chore to earn money rather than a genuinely fun game. also, the tale of souls mode which is basically the arcade mode with little bits of inconsequential story and shenmue style qtr bits thrown in really feels slow.<br /><br />" omg !!!you don't know what your saying" is probably what the more overzealous of you are thinking , but don't get it twisted-i don't hate this game-this game is great! its still got that classic game play (although some characters moves have been needlessly changed) , absolutely stunning graphics and that epic soundtrack that the games are known for. and also on the good side of things are the new characters ( particularly zasalamel ), who are all cool in their own way (except setsuka-yes i know i'm nitpicking).<br /><br />its just that compared to soul calibur 1 and 2 it feels like its trying to be much more than it actually is. that doesn't mean that its not a classic , it just means that compared to its own high standards it falls a bit short despite having more characters moves stages and better graphics than ever.<br /><br />still, soul calibur 3 wipes the floor with 95% of games out there though - and that counts for something! oh and all those who mark this review as "unhelpful" clearly feel hurt that i insulted their darling setsuka. well listen up fanboy/girl : she ain't real ! and even if she was ,she wouldn't be caught dead with you.
