there's no point in comparing this with the original series. though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. that is, an sf/horror anthology series. due to indifferent scheduling in australia, i've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. the very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from sf. i only hope the dvds reach us eventually.
