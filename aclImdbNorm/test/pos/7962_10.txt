this is, without a doubt, one of the most accomplished debut films for any director. the movie is only 90 minutes long, but manages to say just about everything about life and death. not much action, and dialogue is minimal, but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on. the performances by the leads are perfection, and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes. the movie will be somewhat lost on today's modern audience, but this is one that everyone ought to see.refreshingly unsentimental and honest, this is on par with ozu's works. <br /><br />scratch my title, this one is perfect!
