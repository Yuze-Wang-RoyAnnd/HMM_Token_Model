my sisters and my cousin(female) forced me to see this chick movie. its not the kind of movie i would prefer to see, but it really wasn't that bad. i wouldn't want to see this movie, but after watching it i couldn't say it was bad, just not my kind of film. it was very accurate in acting out what woman really talk about and do in certain situations. as a guy, i wasn't too amused by the jokes, but man the women sure were. they related to the movie and yeah it was funny to see themselves on the big screen. "oh em gee i do that to haha" i've never seen the original, nor would i care to. if you are a girl, this is a must see, but maybe girls would say this movie sucked, probably. i don't see a 13 year old going, "wow i remember going threw that when i was 30."<br /><br />no man would have this in there collection, but i can't say it was horrible, so meh.
