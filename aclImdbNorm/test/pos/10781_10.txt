excellent and highly under-rated from beginning to end. one of oliver's best. well scripted, directed, shot, acted and stuarts copeland's soundtrack (trivia: the music during the end credits vaguely sounds like a late 90's pop hit by "spacehog" band <br /><br />eric and cast are brilliant, let alone the callers. what a whirlwind of emotions. it make's your hair stand on end. (..."necks will be broke and whips will crack"--in a old female southern accent.. yike! creepy. scary than any horror movie.<br /><br />10 out of 10<br /><br />em
