i think josh duhamel is so great!! the rest of the show is fun to watch, but, i think it is the handsome and sexy josh duhamel that makes the show "las vegas" really fun to see!! in the days of "magnum" i loved tom selleck, i thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth!! a hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something, especially just for purposes of innocuous entertainment!! i would have done anything to "win a date with tad hamilton"!! josh duhamel is incredible and i will always have a super crush on him!! josh is definitely a hunk!! and i will watch "las vegas" all the time, josh duhamel is a big reason why too!!
