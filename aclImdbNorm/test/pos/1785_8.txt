well, i fear that my review of this special won't heed much different observation than the others before me, but i literally just watched it- during a pbs membership drive- and frankly i'm too excited not to say anything. to really appreciate the enigma that is barbra streisand, you have to look back before the movies. before the broadway phenomenon of the mid-60's. when television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today: musical variety. some musical shows were weekly series, but others were single, one-time specials, usually showcasing the special talent of the individual performer. this is where we get the raw, uninhibited first looks at streisand. she had already been a guest performer on other variety shows including garry moore, ed sullivan, and scored a major coup in a one-time only tandem appearance with the woman who would pass her the baton of belter extraordinary: judy garland. in 1966, color me barbra introduced barbra streisand in color (hence the title), but copied the format of her first special a year earlier almost to the letter. in 3 distinct acts, we get an abstract streisand (in an after-hours art museum looking at and sometimes becoming the works of art), a comic streisand working an already adoring audience in a studio circus (populated with many fuzzy and furry animals), and best of all, a singing streisand in mini-concert format just-- well, frankly, just doing it. <br /><br />it amazes me that she still had the film debut of funny girl yet to come, as well as turns as songwriter, director, and political activist. here, she is barely 24 years old, doing extraordinary things because, as she puts it in her own on-camera introduction, 'we didn't know we couldn't, so we did.' the art museum sequence is shot in philadelphia over one weekend immediately after the museum closed to the public on saturday evening, and apparently done with only one color camera. yet there are cuts, dissolves, and tracking shots galore, resulting in one rather spectacular peak moment-- the modern, slightly beatnik-flavored, "gotta move." after getting lost amongst the modern abstracts, jazz-club bongos begin, with streisand emerging in a psychedelic gown and glittering eye makeup, doing the catchy staccato tune with almost androgynous sex appeal. it is not until act 3, believe it or not, that the moment is matched or bettered by another feat: in the concert sequence, in a white gown and pearl earrings, streisand recites the torchy "any place i hang my hat is home," tearing into the final notes and revealing one of those climactic belts that makes you scream like a little girl even if you're 44 years old...and a guy. just plain old great television. check it out.
