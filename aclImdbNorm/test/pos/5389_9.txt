if you like gary cooper, this is one of his best roles. his gentle intensity to right a wrong is what made his career. "blayde hollister" comes to dallas to take revenge against will and brian malowe, who burned his georgia farm and killed his family. inept marshall gets in hollister's way, attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shootout between hollister and wild bill hickock. the shootout is staged to get the law off hollister, & he takes the "back east" marshall under his wing to keep him alive in texas, as they switch identity. <br /><br />that was a great beginning, and the picture holds up all the way through. action may be a little "slow" by today's standards, but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
