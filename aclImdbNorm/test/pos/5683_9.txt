one of the best horror/suspense movies i have seen in a long time. wow, it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was, sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare. i expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. <br /><br />this is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening. i know some people in other reviews compare it to "open water", but i disagree because i thought open water was quite boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially they are filmed in the same "realistic" style.<br /><br />the actors are unknowns, at least to me, but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism. the story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about. very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it.<br /><br />i had tears in my eyes at the end. i must say a movie seldom has this effect on me, this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and i am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie.
