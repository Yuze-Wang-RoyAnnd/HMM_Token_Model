who's the man~~~ what's that i hear? a resounding cry of kevin? well if you didn't shout for the 'usual suspect' i'd recommend changing your medicated prescription. anyway this is no first class movie, just a very well produced story, that is almost believable. considering its about an alien your probably wondering what the? all acting is top stuff and also the first i've seen a balanced, sarcastic alien. just enjoyable is all i can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the movie). seven stars
