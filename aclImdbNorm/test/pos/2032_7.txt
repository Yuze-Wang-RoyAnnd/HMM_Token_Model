nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. everything from acting to cinematography was solid. not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. definitely worth checking out. if in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. though you may not feel like running out and buying it, i found it to be quite worth while.
