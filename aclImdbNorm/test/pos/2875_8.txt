well, i'm a few days late but what the hell....! anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to "see no evil" was....surprise. the film is actually pretty good. there is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. it hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. think "madman" meets leatherface with a dash of norman bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick. while sne is thin on plot (most horror films are), it kind of makes up for it in the violence/methods of killing, the gore, suspense & the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed jacob goodnight. the title of the film comes from the fact that jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers & stores them in big jars. why?? you'll just have to watch it & see (pun intended). there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho, tcm, & madman but they're not blatant. finally, sne really doesn't go into territory we long timers haven't seen before & granted, sne is no "pyscho" or "tcm 74" but it certainly merits a look imo. <br /><br />bloodstone's recommendation: take in a matin'ee showing of "see no evil" bloodstone's rating: 7.5/10
