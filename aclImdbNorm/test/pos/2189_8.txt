well i'm not the world's biggest sondheim fan, so although i have the cast album and i've listened to it a few times i've never actually seen this show performed and i haven't seen the tim burton movie version either. i felt like i wanted to see something more faithful before i see the burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. this version isn't a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly angela lansbury's performance as nellie lovett. this is one of those performances that's just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself. she must have had so much fun with this role. sweeney todd himself isn't played by len cariou, who did it originally, but by george hearn. hearn does a fantastic job; his voice isn't quite as good as cariou's, but he seems to play it a bit broader.<br /><br />the only problem i had really was with the johanna character as played by betsy joslyn, and to some extent her lover anthony as played by cris groenendaal. joslyn's voice can't sustain high notes, but i wasn't entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since i'm not hugely familiar with this play. more importantly, i'm not sure if the story of "sweeney todd" really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music, but thankfully the whole thing doesn't seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators. as a lark, and a bit of comedy in the vein of "grand guignol", it's quite enjoyable. i don't feel like it's as significant a piece of work as "company" and "into the woods" or some of his other shows. some of the music is quite spectacular, but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show.<br /><br />i won't say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film, but just a play that has been shot on film. there were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it. people will want to see this, because it preserves lansbury's legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because it's a hilarious and insightful performance. george hearn can be proud of his version of sweeney as well. this would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater, because i prefer shows from the 20s through the 50s to these later era affairs. "sweeney todd" is an exceptional show from its era however, miles and miles above the al webber madness.
