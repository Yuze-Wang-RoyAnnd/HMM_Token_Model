guilt and redemption are two of the staple emotions and plot elements of the heavy, powerful dramas that the oscars love so much (which is kind of funny since "the kite runner" was only nominated for best original score-the lack of nominations was perhaps unjust). while most film adaptations of books (or any other means) are usually inferior to their literary counterparts (and "the kite runner" is not an exception), marc forster's film adaptation is a good one.<br /><br />most people are familiar with the story, the book having been read by millions, so i won't go into the plot except to say that the book stays pretty faithful to its source. that being said, if you don't know the plot, see the movie, or better yet, read the book.<br /><br />the best thing "the kite runner" has going for it (other than its story) is director marc forster. forster is a director with epic scope and unique vision that is perfectly utilized in bringing khaled hosseini's book to the screen. a small part of me worried that he would use the same dreamy images that were included in one of forster's earlier features, "finding neverland." don't get me wrong, "finding neverland" is a wonderful film, one of my favorites actually, but the visual trickery he used in there doesn't have a place here. fortunately, forster understands that, and the brilliance of his direction shows his versatility. though the lack of a best director nomination for his work here is not exactly a travesty, i see a number of statuettes in store for him down the road.<br /><br />also of note is the screenplay adaptation. it remains faithful to the source, but it leaves room for forster's vision to interpret the material. the dialogue is not dumbed down, and it. along with forster's direction, moves at a solid pace. like forster, the lack of recognition at awards time for the screenplay was not an outrage, but i wouldn't have complained if it was at least nominated.<br /><br />the dividing line here between this film being great and outstanding lies with the acting. most of the performances are solid, but there are some that don't quite make the cut, and it hurts the film. the most notable weak performance comes from zekeria ebrahimi, who plays the young amir. it's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it could be. he just can't translate the guilt that consumes amir to the audience. in fact, i think i might have been a little lost at this point in the movie at this point had i not read the book because of this. he looks somber, and at times resentful, but we can't feel his emotions. this is a difficult part to portray, and for the most part young ebrahimi holds his own, which is especially surprising since this is his first film role.<br /><br />the best performances come from khalid abdalla, who plays the adult amir, and shaun toub, who plays the wise rahim kahn. abdalla may not be a known name (though he was in paul greengrass's "united 93"), but his work here is amazing. he's a quiet, modest man, and he emotes perfectly when needed to. a lesser-capable actor could have made the character of rahim khan into a clich'e, but shaun toub uses enough subtlety and care in his performance that he creates what the clich'es are trying to portray.<br /><br />forgive me if i go on a rant here, but this is something that i must address, and that is the film's pg-13 rating. the fact that this film received such a low rating is outrageous. there is no justification for it. some could argue that the rating was bent because of the need for everyone to see it, like the gore in "saving private ryan," which some say should have earned the film an nc-17 rating. but that exception cannot be applied here. the only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story. forster (probably at the behest of the producers) tried as hard as he could to tame the film's most painful and disturbing scene to allow the film to sneak by with a pg-13 rating, but the subject material is too disturbing to be depicted in any way and get less than an r rating, regardless of if how "tasteful" is may be portrayed. worse, this editing robs the scene of much of its power, and by trying it make it less disturbing to get the lower rating is insulting. furthermore, some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing as well. in terms of how much time these scenes take of the movie, it doesn't add to much, but what is there is well deserving of an r rating at the very least. the mpaa, whose system of rating movies has always been corrupt, has sunk to a new low by giving this film such a low rating.<br /><br />but one shouldn't fault the film for this. the film is a solid film that is well-worth seeing, especially if they are fans of the book.
