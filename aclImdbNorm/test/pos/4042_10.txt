first off, i can remember vaguely being told this story in primary school, about 6 or 7 years ago so i am sort of familiar with the story.<br /><br />a lot of that has changed however, and there are many differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in the film that die hard fans will not appreciate.<br /><br />however as a whole i really love this film. i first saw it near christmas about 2 years ago (well the 1st part) then caught the whole thing again last christmas probably on the same channel.<br /><br />i was very impressed, at times it may be a bit overdrawn and long, but with an engaging story, decent acting (especially from frosty fonda and hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costume and little touches of magic make this a really special film - which for me really reminds me of christmas.<br /><br />despite differences from the book, i think the film does well to incorporate new themes and ideas (the seasons with autumn, winter etc. with i think a new thief character to represent autumn) throughout the imagery once you notice is quite startling and brilliantly executed.<br /><br />i live in the uk so have waited a long time for the dvd, and luckily enough i saw an advert showing a series of free dvd's being offered in the daily mail newspaper which i don't normally get, so i got yesterdays issue and finally have my dvd. if you missed it and want this rare dvd for region 2 i suggest you collect the tokens from the daily mail and send them off as your dvd will then be delivered by christmas.<br /><br />so for a bit of escape into the christmas season this year, put on your fire, get cosy and watch this as you and kids probably will really enjoy this great film. if you don't have it, it will probably be repeated on channel 4 this christmas, so record it!
