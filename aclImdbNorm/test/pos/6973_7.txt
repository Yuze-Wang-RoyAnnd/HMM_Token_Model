**spoilers** simple movie about simple people who's problems are far too complex for them to handle.<br /><br />natalie aka sara ravenna, shirley knight, has become overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she's now pregnant is the straw that breaks the camel's back. taking off from her homes in long island new york natalie has no idea where she's going but hopes to find peace and tranquility somewhere in the heartland of america. it's on the pennsylvania turnpike that natalie picks up hitchhiker jimmie "killer" kilgannon, james cann,who seems as lost and confused as she is. as natalie, calling herself sara at the time, soon finds out jimmie had suffered a serious brain concussion while playing football on his collage team and has been reduced to such a simple minded individual who's so passive that he lets everyone, including later in the movie natalie, step all over him.<br /><br />sympathetic at first natalie becomes very annoyed at the self pitying jimmie for not standing up for himself and letting himself be used as a doormat by everyone he comes in contact with in the movie. not knowing what to do with the child-like jimmie natalie finally gets him a job in far off nebraska as a cleaning man at the reptile jungle pet market owned and run by, mr. alfred, tom aldrege. being the both kind and simple-minded person that he is jimmie lets all the animals out of their cages causing havoc at the pet store and has him fired by his boss mr. alfred.<br /><br />in the meantime natalie who thought that she was finally through with jimmie ends up back at the reptile jungle when she's given a speeding ticket by traffic cop gordon, robert duvall. it seems that mr. alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person that natalie is to pay her traffic fine to. while all this is happening gordon-the cop- had developed a strong liking for natalie and wants to get her in the sack, at his trailer home, the first chance he can. gordon a widower with a uncontrollable 12 year old daughter rosalie, marva zimmet, needs a mature woman-with lots of lovin'- to make him forget his many social and psychological problems and natalie is exactly the medicine that the doctor ordered!<br /><br />***spoilers*** wild and shocking final with gordon going completely out of his mind and attempting to rape natalie, who refused his drunken advances, which has jimmie finally get out of his self-pitying stupor and came to her rescue. there's no happy ending here with natalie saved from being both manhandled and raped by gordon but jimmie, who was bouncing gordon around like a ping-pong ball, ending up dead for all his good and noble efforts.<br /><br />jimmy by far was he most tragic and sympathetic person in the entire movie. all jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with and all he ended up getting was the sh*t end of the stick. by everyone even the one person who at first treated him with kindness and understanding natalie ravenna! in the end jimmie even though he was treated like dirt by everyone despite his willingness not to offend even those who stepped all over him came out as the most likable kindest as at the same time heroic person in the entire film.
