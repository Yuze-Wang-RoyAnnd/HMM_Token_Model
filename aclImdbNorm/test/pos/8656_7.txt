enjoyed 'den brysomme mannen' http://ow.ly/pttp (my wife didn't, so i watched it in bits over a few days.)<br /><br />reviewers mainly confused - most agree it's allegorical, but not of what; 'heaven', 'hell', 'socialism', 'capitalism'? <br /><br />that most people don't wish to escape, and it's, essentially, forbidden goes with most of those options.<br /><br />so, presumably you're supposed to project your favourite preoccupation/prejudice/fear onto it. <br /><br />so i'd say it's about an a-epicurean life. a live desaturated of colour, literally in the film, figuratively in the interpretation.
