i enjoyed the film very much, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful gong li as the concubine.<br /><br />it was a little distracting, however, to have chinese dialogue plus english subtitles plus american-accented voice-over, even though the voice over was very well synchronised.<br /><br />qin shi huiang di's (the first emperor of qin's)family name was zheng, and his given name yiong so in the english he should have been referred to as "king zheng" or "emperor zheng", and not as "king ying zheng" as in those days the two family/given names were not used together.<br /><br />the state of qin is pronounced "chin" not "shin" - a pity the researchers didn't get this right.<br /><br />i forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at "zai-an" together with his terra cotta warriors. the town xi'an is pronounced "see-an" , never "zai-an"- surely the american voice-over speakers could have got that right !
