the a-team is still repeating every day on dutch television (rtl7, around 1800hrs) and i still watch it! i don't like the a-team... i absolutely adore them!! it is just great to see justin chasing the former members of a-team. brings back memories from the old days, when i was young an sweet. i would have given you a 10 for excellent, but justin looks like he is chasing the former a-team members all by himself. of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary. too bad justin does not look for melinda culea ("amy a. allen"). but it is great to see mr. t. back into action. too bad for him, he does not show up at the party, at the end. but that party is too short to laugh again and to see everybody in action again.
