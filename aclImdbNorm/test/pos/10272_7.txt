a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot. the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor's innermost feeling. max, who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there, comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend. non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well. the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations. his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see. she gives him also no love but only stability. true love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend. merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable. the one who really animates max's life in fact is her best friend. the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling. the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. not equally ingenious as "pulp fiction" but things seem much more natural in "the apartment". max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to romane bohringer. the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful. a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing. <br /><br />
