greetings again from the darkness. director alejandro amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny. the great javier bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as ramon. his eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind. the dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question posed is , what is love? at every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. the script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room. the supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with ramon's decision. this is a gem and deserves to be seen.
