i was unsure of this movie before renting and did so on the assurance that hilary swank has always given excellent performances in her movies. she seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does. and she didn't prove me wrong in this movie.<br /><br />however the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non-speaking. i have to single out jamie bartlett and chiwetel ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings. the whole movie ran almost like a documentary.<br /><br />i must applaud tom hooper as the director and avril beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion. the opening sequence of the south african landscape was striking and i had to push the pause button to savour the photography.<br /><br />why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an international award. it seems to me to hit the high-rating button on all counts. it was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid. a life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
