for those of you who have no idea what bug juice is or was, it was a children's reality show about real kids living at summer camp. bug juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. it was full of romance, friendships, fights, overcoming your fears, and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months. it was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t.v. regularly, but is amazing non-the-less. the show was never dull and always attracted my attention. it's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it's like before going. plus disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that's at a camp for like only a week. the length of the camps where perfect for this show, and the environment they where in was fantastic. they where camps all over the u.s., that each provided unique activities for the campers. it was a truly amazing, unscripted show.
