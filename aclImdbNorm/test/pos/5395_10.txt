this film was great! i love the way it mixes dark humor with drama. there are times when you think there is no possible way you could laugh at the situation presented, and yet you experience a surprising giggle. it is wonderfully acted, with great performances by sigourney weaver, jeff daniels, and emile hirsch. it is well written with a stylish, surprising ending. i'm not one to say that everyone will like it as much as i did, but give it a chance and rent it. the dvd has great special features, including full-length commentaries by director, dan harris and emile hirsch and one by sigourney weaver, that give you interesting information about the film. i hope my comment is helpful, and that you enjoy the movie!
