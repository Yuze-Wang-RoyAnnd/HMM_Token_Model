i don't understand how people could not like this movie. you have gossit jr., the kid who played the main character in stand by me, sean astin, and many other great actors. lots of action and fun that you don't see in today's movies anymore. it's really a shame. <br /><br />this is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like let's get harry. the 80's and early 90's created such great movies that will never again be topped by today's standards. <br /><br />they tried to somehow recreate this movie in masterminds, but came up short with some really bad acting. the only thing that movie had going was patrick stewart, but obviously that wasn't enough.
