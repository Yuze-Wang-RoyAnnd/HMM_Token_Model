the very first time i heard of latter days was when i was renting dvd's and i was interested as i am a member of the lds church. i found this movie very heartfelt and in several areas it made me cry. the reason for this is that too many years ago i knew a young man who went through what aaron (played by steve sandvoss)does in latter days, but unlike aaron this dear young man did not survive the ordeal. he ended up taking is life after his church, his friends, and his family disowned him because he was gay. there have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age, but the sorry and sad thing is they do. for those of you out their who are gay and young you need to see this movie and if you are a gay mormon you really need to see this movie. plus if you get the dvd there is help for you listed in the dvd. teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but that part is hidden to a degree. the acting and the music is excellent. this movie sold out every movie house that it showed but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release, so for those who would like to see this movie i would recommend the dvd release. the only people that i know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the subject matter gays and the lds church. see the movie, experience the story, and feel the emotions that are showcased in this movie you i feel will not be disappointed.
