i ended up liking this movie but it was not the easiest to get through. what makes the movie great is the music and the scenery. the songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. a great job was done to show different settings for the rom people.<br /><br />however, the viewer was not guided enough. a more in depth history of the rom people would have been nice. only a fraction of the of the spoken words were given english subtitles. in addition, more explanations about the settings and who was their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too. it would have helped if there were a narrator too explain about customs, dress and music.
