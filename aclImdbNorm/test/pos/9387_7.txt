death bed: the bed that eats.<br /><br />judging from the title, you can guess what this movie is about. and yet there is a lot more (background) story to this film then one might suspect.<br /><br />okay, so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food, but there are also a few subplots. i won't spoil them for you, but they're a nice touch.<br /><br />sadly, the acting in this movie is very mediocre. the fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesn't really help to improve the quality of the movie as a whole.<br /><br />because there is a lot of voice-over work. the thoughts of characters are also revealed to the watchers. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />the effects are fine. sure, it could be a lot better if you compare it with today's movies. but you really shouldn't; just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. you have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative. if you are easily spooked, don't watch this movie. you might never want to sleep again...<br /><br />death bed: the bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget, but i'd still recommend it to fans of horror movies.<br /><br />in conclusion, i give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for it's creative story and unexpected twists here and there.
