a funny and scathing critique of russian society and culture during the transition from communism, okno v parizh also shows the west in an unfavorable light. a group of russians living in st. petersburg (a.k.a. peter the great's "window on the west") find a magic portal that instantly transports them to paris. mamin's film is truly hilarious, and just "weird" enough constantly keep even the jaded film viewer on his toes. the songs, the dream sequences, and the deliciously disgusting fringes of society from both cultures mingle to create a memorable and meaningful film. anyone trying to understand the shift in russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the ussr should begin here.
