vincenzo buonavolunta, a man that has spent years working at a steel mill, as a maintenance man, that the italian owners are selling to the chinese, comes at the end of the meeting where the purchase is being arranged because he wants to tell the new buyers of a flaw he has discovered and he thinks he has the solution. he doesn't exactly endear himself to the italian old management, or to the new chinese owners. he even fights with the translator about the exact term he wants to use in expressing his concern.<br /><br />the next thing we see is vincenzo arriving in china trying to contact the new owners. to his amazement, there is someone new in charge, as mr. chong, the man he tried to warn in italy, has been fired. his next quest is getting to the woman that was the translator, liu hua. he finds her working in a library, but she tells him, in no uncertain terms, she blames him for being fired from her position. liu, who sees the desperation of vincenzo, agrees to accompany him to find his steel mill plant. <br /><br />thus vincenzo and liu begin a voyage through some of the bleak countryside that involves traveling by train, steamship, bus and truck, to remote parts of the giant country. finding the correct factory proves to be elusive, at best, but vincenzo discovers a life that is completely alien to him, as well as finding a kind soul who doesn't hesitate to help the italian man, in spite of her initial distaste for him.<br /><br />gianni amelio's film is a sort of travelogue. he takes the viewer into unknown territory. some comments compare vincenzo to marco polo, the great italian traveler, although the similarities are not quite tangible. the film keeps our attention in the early stages of the trip, but it starts getting somewhat less enjoyable as vincenzo gets stranded after separating from liu. mr. amelio is an interesting director, as he clearly demonstrates with this film for which he worked on the adaptation of ermano rea's novel, which we haven't read.<br /><br />sergio castellitto is the sole reason for watching the film. this versatile actor brings a lot to the movie, which, in a way, is a tour de force for him, as he is seen in almost every frame of the picture. the combination of amelio and castellitto proves to be a winning combination. ling tai, who is making her debut as liu hua, has some lovely moments and shows good chemistry with her co-star.<br /><br />luca bigazzi photographed the chinese landscape in all its bleakness. we see a china that is not picture post card pretty. mr. bigazzi captures all the greyness, so typical of the areas where the film is set. franco piersanti's musical score serves the film well.
