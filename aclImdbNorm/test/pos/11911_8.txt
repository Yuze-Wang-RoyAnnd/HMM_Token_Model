being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind, but still, this isn't a bad movie by any means. it's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble. what's wrong with that? it doesn't have any big special effects, but so what? who needs special effects? cinema's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized. a coincidence? i think not. it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big, substance-less light show for innocent kids and the self-medicated. well, you know, not all movies need special effects. about three fourths of the movies on the imdb top 250 are without special effects, but almost all of the top grossing movies of all time have some special effects. think about it: star wars, e.t., ghostbusters, etc. all good movies, but the rest of the top-grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non-sensical plots and lots of eye candy. well some movies don't need ny of that junk.<br /><br />excuse me for going off on a tangent, which i normally do, but i'm just so fed up with that special effects junk. back to the point: toy soldiers is simply a great movie. i admit, some of the content is a little corny and ripped off, but so what, every movie rips off another to some extent. think of resovoir dogs. countless "appreciation" sites dictate the fact that beloved quentin tarentino, who i admit i like, has copied many, many, many movies in the making of his first major film reservoir dogs. many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr. tarentino loved so much, and probably still does. sorry once again for the tangent.<br /><br />toy soldiers is fun. it has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority, i.e. hostage takers. it's fun to see kids take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do. hell, teenage angst-inspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to 80's comedies. plus there's the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire-arms and knock out the bad guys, etc. plus there's some emotional points to the film. when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust. it's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there.<br /><br />in short, toy soldiers is exciting, interesting, and fun. how dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly! shame on you all!<br /><br />personal rating: 8/10
