this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in ages. i watched for about 20 minutes, slightly puzzled by what was going on. then i started to laugh and didn't stop 'til long after the movie ended. such deadpan satire is rare indeed. christopher guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual males, to start with). as in "waiting for guffman" guest nails middle america's idiotic self-importance to the wall. i can hardly wait for his next film.
