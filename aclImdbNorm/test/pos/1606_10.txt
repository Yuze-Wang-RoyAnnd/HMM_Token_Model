it may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. perhaps, because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. the true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. bogard is amazing and needless to say that venice is utilised as a perfect scenery: dark, sinking and dreary just like bogard's soul. and classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings. in my opinion, a classic masterpiece of european film-making.
