it seems a lot of europeans and americans see indian movies for the wrong reason; i see some people are complaining that this movie did not have any dance sequence! a class apart from their hindi counterparts, bengali movies tend to be more realistic. rituparno ghosh is one of the best young directors in india, being widely known for his choice of subjects for the movies and the strength of his scripts. 'chokher bali' is a perfect example. a faithful adaptation of the nobel laureate tagore's novel dealing with the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a bengali widow, the director gives a new dimension to the much acclaimed and controversial work.
