man, i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. everyone thinks they're a critic. they comment on things that the average movie goer doesn't even know or think about.<br /><br />i enjoyed the film. it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed. steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that's also a reason to watch. what's even more funny is the people that complain about his films, say he's the worst and that we shouldn't watch his films, yet watch his movies anyway. all so they can comment on how bad they are. who's the dummy? if you don't like his work, don't watch it. then you won't have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful event.<br /><br />stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again.
