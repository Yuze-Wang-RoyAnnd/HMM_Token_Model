2005 will go down in 'dr.who' history as its most incredible year. everything seemed to click; a first-rate new doctor and companion, big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. but then christopher eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. it looked like the honeymoon was over. luckily, the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent david tennant. on top of this the show boasts fine s.f.x., like the spaceship crashing into 'big ben' in 'aliens of london' and superb story lines such as 'tooth & claw', 'army of ghosts/doomsday'. the new 'dr.who' is basically the same as the old, only updated for the 21st century. some fans have accused russell t.davies of 'ruining' the show. they need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along.
