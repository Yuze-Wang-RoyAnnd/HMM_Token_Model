this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. it is about true love and friendship. about turning your life around and doing something good for someone else. thomas bo larsen may play the same role he has done in so many other movies, but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too. but so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies
