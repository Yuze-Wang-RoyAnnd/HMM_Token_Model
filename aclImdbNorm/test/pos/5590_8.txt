who won the best actress oscar for 1933? it should have been laura hope crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. she truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. she played the frivolous prudence duvernoy in "camille" (1936) and her best remembered role is aunt pittypat in "gone with the wind".<br /><br />irene dunne was the "official" star of the film but her scenes with laura hope crewes were dynamite.<br /><br />david (joel mccrea) is in heidelberg when he is offered a job in new york. his wife, christine (irene dunne) can continue her studies at the rockafellar centre. their first stop in america is a visit to david's mother, mrs. phelps. to say that laura hope crewes dominates every scene is an under-statement. from her first entrance - in a frantic burst of effort to greet her "big boy" - all attention is on her. even sitting around the tea table, when she forgets hester's existence, even forgetting how she takes her tea, you know something is not quite right.(hester has been living there for a while.)<br /><br />frances dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable hester. her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how under-rated as an actress she was.<br /><br />all the young cast are excellent. eric linden is superb as robert, the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother's spell. joel mccrea, at one point says "painting roses on bathtubs - that's more your style". there is a very subtle suggestion in the film of robert's sexuality.<br /><br />irene dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried.
