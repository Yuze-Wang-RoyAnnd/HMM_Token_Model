ok, i am a sucker. i loved it. i had no expectations and had them all fulfilled. it was a terrible movie. i loved it. i have managed to wear out a dvd from over use. no one can understand my obsession. i can't either, to tell the truth. for those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise, but i asked the clerk at the video store if i could buy a copy and i could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me.<br /><br />now, the movie is terrible. the special effects are terrible. the acting is terrible, but i loved it. the actors are silly, the plot silly, the goofs numerous--like being able to see through the monsters, the "arachnids" looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), there was light underground, tnt wasn't deafening, etc...<br /><br />you must really love b-movies to get any enjoyment out of this...alcohol helps enormously for others.
