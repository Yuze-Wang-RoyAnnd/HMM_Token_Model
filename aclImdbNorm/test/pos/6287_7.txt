i've sat through several pauly shore movies, but this is the only one that i've liked. of course, it helps that he is far less irritating than usual, perhaps even a little likeable. the rest of the cast does a fine job, especially underrated carla gugino. the film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy, and although few of the jokes are especially funny, the film is quite entertaining overall.
