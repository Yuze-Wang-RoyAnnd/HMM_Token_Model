this movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well. for anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers. the soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complimented it nicely. some of the student's attitudes might have been a little far-fetched like leroy's especially because i'm sure someone like that would've been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such if this was the real high school for performing arts. the coco screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak stomachs, please heed my warning. while it's very gritty i know it's the truth on what happens so in this respect the movie is right on. overall it's entertaining and even though some parts drag on the majority goes by really quickly.<br /><br />final grouping:<br /><br />movies: probably would've skipped this one.<br /><br />dvd purchase: not something i'd need to see again and again.<br /><br />rental: worth renting at least once in your life!
