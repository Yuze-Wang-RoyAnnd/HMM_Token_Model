no doubt that the indie flick eddie monroe is one of the better independent films i've seen in a long time. the highlight for me was the performance of paul vario. i first saw paul, or "big paulie" as he was called in danny provenzano's hit indie, "this thing of ours". thankfully, the "eddie monroe" filmmaker(s) did the same and utilized paul's undeniable skills in a principle (principal?) role. out came a performance (on camera and voice-over utilization as well) that shows worthy of big-budget studio roles in the very near future. it's refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to the trade, prove the same to the audience. keep up the good work big paulie and we'll be seeing you in hollywood real soon! not bad for a kid from canarsie, huh?
