the producer, matt mochary, stumbled upon the film's subject, anderson sa (leader of the afroreggae music movement), when on a hewlett foundation trip to rio de janeiro. mochary was so moved by sa's story that he called his friend, nyc filmmaker jim zimbalist, who quit his job and joined mochary in brazil to work on a documentary on sa, rio's favelas, and the culture of violence.<br /><br />the first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in rio's favelas (shantytowns where the poor live) via footage of police raids and assaults on the residents. the footage is graphic and shocking.<br /><br />rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic anderson sa, who overcame a possible career in drug dealing to start the afroreggae movement, which combines elements of afro-brazilian culture, reggae, ska, and other elements into a fast-paced, percussion heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world. you can't help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the local children get involved in sa's school, which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs. the rest of the film follows sa's meteoric rise and his positivity changes many of the children's lives to seek a life beyond drug running. spoiler: just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming, an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed. the film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end.<br /><br />this film is a response to "city of god," and a worthy one at that. the bleak situation portrayed in that movie is countered by a real example of how favela dwellers can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to constructive ends. you can't help not liking and rooting for anderson sa to succeed.<br /><br />this film is terrifically shot, fast-paced, and is quite absorbing. judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last night's silverdocs screening, the film should get domestic distribution in the us and the thumping soundtrack should be released as well. keep an eye for this superlative documentary--it is excellent!
