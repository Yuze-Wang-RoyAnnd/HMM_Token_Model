i have to say this movie is absolutely amazing. i don't understand why it got such a low rating. it has romance, music, darkness and vampires. also stuart townsend did a great job of being lestat, the acting was great. also, normally i am not into that music, well sometimes. but i have to say in this movie the music fit it perfectly. if you like dark movies about vampires this is definitely for you or even if you don't there is a love story to this.but,all i can say is one word: amazing! my rating is defiantly: 10 out of 10. anyway, i seriously suggest you watch it. i remember not seeing this for years, i watched it again about a year ago and im addicted to it again. lol. great movie!!!
