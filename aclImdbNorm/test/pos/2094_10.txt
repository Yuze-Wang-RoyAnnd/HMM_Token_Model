what i got was something better.<br /><br />just like many movies i've commented on as of recently, i'd been looking forward to this one for a while. especially after i saw one of toshiaki toyoda's other films, "blue spring" which is easily in my top 20 favorite films. i loved the trailer for "9 souls", and i thought it sounded very good. i didn't hear anything bad about it. now i know why.<br /><br />this movie starts up as sort of a comedy, then during the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else. it becomes more dramatic as each of the characters face their own tragedies. each character gets just enough screen time, and you care about what happens to each of them. even though there are 9 characters we have to learn, and care about, within just two hours, toshiaki toyoda pulls it off brilliantly.<br /><br />after i saw "blue spring" i was hoping the soundtrack would be at least a little bit as good, as it was in that film. i got my wish, because the soundtrack to "9 souls" was also incredible. the music used in each scene, more specifically the more dramatic ones, is just simply wonderful. i loved every second of it.<br /><br />i wasn't sure whether or not i wanted to see another toshiaki toyoda film, "pornostar", but after i saw this, i'm going to. definitely. also, because i read the plot for it, and i think it sounds really good. i'm looking forward to it. on the r1 dvd of "9 souls", there are two interviews with toyoda. he says he's completed another film, and he wants to start writing the screenplay for his next. i can't wait for both.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film. you must see it. now.
