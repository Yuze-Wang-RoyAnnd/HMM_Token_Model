a large bed possessed by a demon eats people, among other things. i'm not making this up.<br /><br />completed in 1977 and not officially released until it came to dvd in 2003, "death bed: the bed that eats" is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe. you most likely know of it thanks to patton oswalt's excellent bit about it, as well as stephen throwers essential book "nightmare usa." while watching it, you wonder the following<br /><br />-who is george berry, and what drugs did he smoke/inject/snort before writing and directing this movie?<br /><br />-is this a horror comedy? a combination of a horror flick and an art movie? a weird prank being pulled on the audience?<br /><br />-what the hell am i watching?<br /><br />"death bed" really defies any explanation. i know, that term is overused, but it couldn't be truer than it is here. this truly beggars description. it is a horror comedy, as well as art film/horror hybrid. but the whole thing is so surreal, it must be seen. the score sounds like the electronic bits from an old candlemass album, the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the movie at times feels like a jesus franco movie-that is, if his movies were intentionally funny.<br /><br />in the end, there really is no proper way to describe this movie. lord knows i've tried, but really, few movies are as odd, unique, or mind boggling as this is. see it...but you've been warned. this is also the only movie george berry has ever done. he definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this, i'll tell you that much.
