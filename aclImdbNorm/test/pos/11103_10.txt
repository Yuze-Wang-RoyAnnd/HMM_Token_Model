there is something about true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction. i guess it is the fact that truth has always been stranger than fiction. the falcon and the snowman tells the true story about christopher boyce and his buddy daulton lee. boyce (hutton) is a former alter boy and intellectual, trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him. his fbi father is able to pull some strings and get his idealist son a job working in the defense department. boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent drinking and goofing around with his co-workers. however, as time goes on, boyce starts to learn top secret information that causes him to doubt the morality of his government. the idealist boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the cia is carrying out in above all places, australia. boyce eventually decides that he will leak some of the top secret info he is privy to, to the kgb. of course, boyce's mistake is the assumption that because the usa is doing bad things, the ussr is the good guy. over time, boyce and his drug-dealing buddy lee (penn), start to sell their top secret information to the kgb. what was once idealism, turns into capitalism and espionage. the strength of this movie is the incredible performances by hutton and penn. although one of them starts off with the best intentions, they will both soon find themselves in an unending downward spiral. great direction, music, everything. not only a great film, but one of my all-time favorites.
