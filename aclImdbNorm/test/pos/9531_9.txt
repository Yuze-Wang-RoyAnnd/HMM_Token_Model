the railway children was on tv again this weekend, and i had forgotten how good it was.<br /><br />if i have a criticism, it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly, there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence. the charm and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little, however.<br /><br />i won't revisit the comments of others, other than to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as being possibly the single most emotional scene in the history of british cinema: as a cynical old git passing through middle age rather too quickly i, too, find i cannot even think of that moment without being hit with a severe case of "i've got something in my eye." in fact, it's not just something in my eye, it moves things around inside me, too, with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel.<br /><br />and jenny agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this film, standing with one foot in childhood and one in young womanhood, and bringing qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl having to grow up rather too quickly.<br /><br />plus a quick plaudit for bernard cribbins. regarded mostly as a lightweight actor, he deftly created a perks of great humanity.
