when i played the first soul calibur on dreamcast i thought it was great. when i played the second i was hooked. and finally when soul calibur iii was released, i bought a playstation 2 and the game.<br /><br />this can really keep you up for hours, with a huge amount of characters, loads of unlockable content, and not to mention a great fighting system, this really is the greatest fighting game to date. <br /><br />the games strong points is foremost the vs. gameplay, were two human players battle each other, either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and customized character. the create character option is vast, and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations.<br /><br />the only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style "grieve edge" (only kicks) has to wear those ridiculous shoes. ^^<br /><br />this is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for. now, i'm just hoping the planned movie won't be crap.
