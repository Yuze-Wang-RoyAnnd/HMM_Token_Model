sure, there's stuff here that the coens and elmore leonard have done before, but so what? if you want entertaining, lusty and smart -- "judas kiss" is near perfect. prudes offended by tongue in cheek porn don't get it (talk about getting your sex and violence out of the way straight up -- keeps your investors happy. that's independent filmmaking 101). as for the brits making a bundle, i highly doubt it. this flick is clearly a labor of love and the budget probably not half of mr. tarantino's salary. maybe guys don't like it as much as women. i thought it rocked. go coco!
