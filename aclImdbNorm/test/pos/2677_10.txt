this show is amazing! i love each and every episode. carrie is a spitfire and doug is a lovable and at times a moron. arthur, spence, danny, deacon and carrie's boss add just a nice end touch to the show, tying up all of the funny, pee in your pants moments. in one of the seasons, doug tries to get carrie drunk, because she is nicer when she is drunk. nice husband right? carrie isn't much better, when her boss needs a ips driver to testify in a small case at her job, carrie hesitates, because she views doug as a slob and doesn't want him to embarrass her, so she hires doug's friend instead. wife of the year. but, who i believe to be funniest is yell-at-random arthur. he is drop-dead hilarious, and angry. hey, you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy. this show is hilarious, and if you haven't seen it yet, then you haven't lived!
