i truly fell in love with the characters. they were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side. sort of a mystery. david graysmark, himself, was an enigma. the secret fears and just secrets in general that he had. there was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and it left the audience either wondering or assuming. there was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden away, yet he'd share a little of himself too. he was the strong male lead character and i admire that type of character. billy moses himself is an incredible actor who could do just about any type of part! he's an amazing talent and a good man. his fans love, respect, and support him endlessly.<br /><br />since this show he's gone onto many other projects and has stretched his acting ability quite a bit more and quite well. kudos to him and all the other actors from this show for doing such an excellent job! i wish them all well. i wish the series would've continued on! it's such a shame it didn't!
