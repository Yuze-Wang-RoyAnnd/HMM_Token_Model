i saw it last week and the sketch about the korea towns was funny . very tongue in cheek and suitable to the political climate. full points to the writers and spike for that. the part where he makes the translator pull a rickshaw and throws out korean words could have been pulled off only by spike. this is a brave attempt by fox . this is a brilliant show and i hope that it pulls off . my wife and i have been tivoing it regularly and although it clashes it with a couple of other programs we watch it now on myspace. i hope fox dedicates full resources to the show and makes it daily. i can't wait to see bobby lee on his show . with people like bernard abedalla behind the show this is on the right track. also mary mae as his wife looks beautiful.
