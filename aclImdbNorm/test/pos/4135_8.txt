i first saw the buddy holly story when i was about seven years old. i had no idea who buddy holly was, nor can i remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to hbo, and watch this engaging biopic. what i remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. i recall the music, great songs that i still love today (i can't believe gary busey sang his own songs and so well - what a stud!) then, came the end. he died. he freaking died. i couldn't believe it. i had no warning, no prior knowledge like most coming into this film. it taught me a harsh lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules that most movies teach us. i just watched the film again tonight and was engaged all over again... and a little saddened.<br /><br />8 out of 10, but i'll admit to a little bias.
