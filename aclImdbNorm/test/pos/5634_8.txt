what gives this movie its personality is the knowledge, in the end, that it is all true. while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on mockumentary in some parts (are they staged or is it really happening humorously?), it does seem to get a bit long towards the end.<br /><br />this movie is funny in places it needs to be, and flows relatively well. reminiscent of christopher guest's movies, if you liked those or adaptation then i recommend you keep a look out for this one.<br /><br />b+
