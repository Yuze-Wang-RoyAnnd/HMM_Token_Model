brilliant film! i am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like pulp f. but thats how it is with post pulp era. many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. but this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from tarantino, which is a good similarity!<br /><br />anyway the film's about a guy bloke in australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it. to his assistance is his deceased brother (anyone remember val kilmer in true r.?) to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail. the gangsters are cold blooded, but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children! they also get served tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery. so a humorous gangster flick with heath ledger in good form (though i'm not a fan) , and bryan brown in great action as a gang leader.
