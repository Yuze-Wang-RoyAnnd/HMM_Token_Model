i saw this at the bendfilm festival friday amid an unsettled crowd of people, not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie. and it really threw the audience when modern love came up after a light, whimsical short (name i forget). <br /><br />people!!! it was really silly to mix this short with modern love - which is a serious drama movie. a film film. <br /><br />so the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then...modern love. hmmmm. modern love, despite my reservations (strange ending, a little too tangential)needed a short film that was commensurate with it's oddball strangeness, so my advice to the programmers for next year is to take more care planning the show.<br /><br />the folks watching modern love really just didn't know what had hit them, - they were led up the path and this is not their fault.<br /><br />modern love has some superb performances which play well against the tangential meanderings of the film - a film that its maker seems to have 'wondered out loud' rather than executed in the normal way a film is scripted and shot.<br /><br />too bad the audience was misinformed. wrong session placement, wrong short film, wrong approach by the well intentioned programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to see a lot more films and travel to some other festivals.
