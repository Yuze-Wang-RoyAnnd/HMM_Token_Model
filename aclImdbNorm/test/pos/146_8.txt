a beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire. <br /><br />physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life. <br /><br />the one-time priest falls deeper in despair and depravity. as things turns for worse, he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanity...<br /><br />the vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the twilight and underworld franchises, but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire, by putting simple things into perspective.<br /><br />these vampires have reflections, and no fangs, but still feed and die the same. making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts. the priest primarily feeds to make himself better, but when he meets his friends unfulfilled wife, carnal instincts set in.<br /><br />what makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consent for the first time, they are experiencing something they have never before, forbidden passion, which makes the scenario all that more sensual.<br /><br />chan-wook adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie. we see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she realises her own strength, just puts the chair down and carry on. hilarious.<br /><br />and the final act wouldn't be out of place in a carry on film, or even the three stooges as the couple fight for survival/death respectively.<br /><br />cgi is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so graceful, you could be watching ballet.<br /><br />the vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this, but more importantly, has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days. it's violent, but from the director in question, i wouldn't expect anything different.<br /><br />a really interesting story, with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography.
