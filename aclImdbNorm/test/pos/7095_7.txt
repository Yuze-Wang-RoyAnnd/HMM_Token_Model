what impressed me the most about "one true thing" was how up-front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. as depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2/3 into the movie ("love story" "terms of endearment", etc.). <br /><br />meryl streep, renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge. the characters they play seem human; they're not perfect people. (arguably, one might not say that about the "martha stewart"-type character streep plays but throughout the film, i found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) <br /><br />"one true thing" is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned.
