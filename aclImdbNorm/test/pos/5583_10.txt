i too remember seeing this film as a youngster at a local small theater that presented foreign films each week. it was the daring adventure of it all that stayed in my memory ever since.<br /><br />especially impressionable was the scene with noel purcell as the old seaman, paddy, who drank too much, saw or heard apparitions and died of fright in a cave. i always kept track of noel's career even decades later due to my seeing him then. there's also a youngish cyril cusack as the leering boatman, james, with designs on the lovely jean simmons, shown as emmeline grown up.<br /><br />would very much like to own a video of this haunting film and refresh my memory of it. where do i send my request?
