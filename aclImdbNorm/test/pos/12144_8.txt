career criminal and crime boss, abel davos (lino ventura) has been on the run for more than 10 years, hiding out in milan, italy. in his absence, he has been sentenced to death in his home country of france for his crimes. disillusioned with his life in italy and with the police there closing in on him, he decides to return to his old stomping ground in paris. sending his wife therese and two young sons ahead to nice, abel and his next in command raymond naldi do one final heist, to fund their new lives back in france. the heist proffers a meagre half million francs, way less than their sources had suggested, despite this and with the police in chase they both make it to nice, where they hideout briefly. after stealing a pleasure boat from a local, they aim to make it to san remo a tourist spot where they will blend in more readily, but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach, a shoot out ensues and therese and naldi are both killed. a now wounded davos with two kids in tow is going to be easily spotted by police, so he calls on his old friends in paris to send help, but they have moved on since their old friend went into hiding and are not too inclined to take a risk themselves, so they send small time thief, eric stark (jean paul belmondo) to rescue him. davos is disgusted that such a lowly thief is sent to his aid, despite the fact he hits it off immediately with the charming stark, he sets out to find out why he has been snubbed, but their betrayal doesn't stop there.<br /><br />classe tous risques (aka the big risk) was written for the screen by former death row inmate and crime writer jose giovanni (le trou, le clan des siciliens), with ventura already on board for the project, giovanniwanted someone unique to direct the project, ventura suggested an assistant director that had caught his attention on a previous project,one claude sautet, best known at the time for assisting georges franju on les yeux sans visage. sautet immediately agreed and the rest as they say is history. sautet crafted a fine gangster film, that plays heavily on characters and relationships. davos constantly in hiding has plenty of time to reflect on his life, past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to be what he believed they were, his now deceased wife and what will become of his two young sons. ventura as a character actor has always amazed me, being both comfortable and convincing in both the police and criminal fraternity, here his world weary performance is sublime and powerful as his world crumbles all around him, as the loneliness and solitude of a man on the run kicks in. ventura's former profession as a pro wrestler gets plenty of use as he throws parisien hoodlums around with a consummate ease. belmondo as stark enlivens the other storyline within the film, that of his budding relationship with a girl he meets on the road trip. with his forthright charm, his coming clean to this woman in danger that he is but a "voleur" and that "the only good thing about me is my left" as he knocks out her aggressor, is also a joy to behold, as she falls for him anyway. belmondo's performance was overlooked at the time, as godard's a bout de souffl'e was released only three weeks previous, godard attaining the credit for discovering the new kid on the block, his versatility within these two films, being there for all to see and admire. sautet's film is a classy affair, using plenty of attractive locations, the film also has very sparse dialogue, sautet preferring to let the actors do the work with the merest of looks or glances sufficing to further the story, needles to say this noir fan will be checking out more of sautet's work in the future.
