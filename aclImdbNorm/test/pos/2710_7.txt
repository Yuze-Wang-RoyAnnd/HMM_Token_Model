one of the better made for tv biopics, i just wish it had told us more. i have read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. cynthis gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring karen to life. one of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into karen's anorexia. in the reading i have done about the disease (especially cherry boone o'neill's wonderful book, starving for attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control. karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control. she felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life. don't get me wrong, i believed she truly loved the music, but she felt she had little control over her career. she truly loved her family, but they did not express it well, and she didn't know how to make her family understand her. the film could have touched so much more on that. i treasure the music i have of the carpenters and wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today.
