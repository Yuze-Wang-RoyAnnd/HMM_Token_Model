you can tell that this is the first offering by the director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential this guy has. this is an obviously low budget film in the spirit of boondock saints. of course, boondock saints came out a few years after this, so you could look at this as a diamond in need of some polish. the acting was good - if you're looking for deniro or michael madsen in a crime drama, remember that these are young guys, playing young guys trying to be criminals. they're not going to be "supercool" (tm) like some of the veterans. i would have love to have seen justin pagel (joe - the main character) go on to make more movies - he was great in this. good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
