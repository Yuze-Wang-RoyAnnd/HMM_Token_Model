this is a great example of very none hollywood film making which is very thought provoking, moving and not without a sense of humor, kevin mckidd and paula sage are superb. <br /><br />i actually watched it on late night tv and i can see why i missed it in the cinema, its not the sort of film that the multi-screen "mega" cinemas show nowadays, mores the pity. <br /><br />i am going to look for the dvd. not for those who prefer, the current trend towards special effects and no story. if you liked the best selling book "the curious incident of the dog in the night-time", you'll enjoy this film. <br /><br />this film ranks beside the best of scottish films, such as "small faces" and "trainspotting". all films which kevin mckidd also star in. <br /><br />highly recommended.
