never mind if 'national velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, clarence brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral. after achieving modest success through her appearance in 'lassie come home (1943),' young elizabeth taylor, age 12, landed her first leading role as velvet brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. though filmed in california, the story - adapted from a novel by enid bagnold - is set in a small township on the english countryside, and full advantage is taken of the technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. mickey rooney takes top billing as mi taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.<br /><br />it is perhaps a good thing that elizabeth taylor had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather limited. her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being rather hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply "believing" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made. nevertheless, taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with mickey rooney, who was no stranger to being a child-star. anne revere plays a very important role as velvet's mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the english channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than mi taylor's own father. i liked that mi was not told about this until the film's final seconds, with mrs. brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.<br /><br />the film reaches its climax at the grand national sweepstakes, where velvet has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the pi, in the world-famous competition. under the guise of a latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). this extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. it doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. i'll wager that 'national velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.
