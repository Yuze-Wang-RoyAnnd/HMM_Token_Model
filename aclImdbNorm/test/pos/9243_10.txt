fascinating look behind the scenes about how a really good movie can get made if the producers, director, & cast simply "refuse to quit." these guys encountered serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project (miniscule budget, trouble with the script and with the script writer) so the finished product wasn't what was first envisioned, but probably turned out to be more interesting than the movie they set out to make, which goes to show that the punk mentality of "just do it" ...with or without any backing, money, or help...figure it out on the fly and do what you want to do. i really liked this documentary movie and know that viewers will see and learn things they didn't know before. this movie is truly "one of a kind...it's hard to classify because it has pieces of "sci fi" and "suspense" and also "how to make a movie." it tells the truth about how films get made, what can go wrong, and how to overcome. i especially liked the music written by ed ivey. these guys know how to produce a good movie on a shoe string because they're creative and know how to build props, dollys, staging, lighting with what they can scavenge up...pretty amazing stuff.
