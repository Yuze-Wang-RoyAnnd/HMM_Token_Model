aaron sorking raises the same questions as shakespeare did or does. how could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life. here like in the west wing, sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears. everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. a puffy tom hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and julia roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines. the subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. philip seymour hoffman, as the invisible middle man, steals every scene he is in, just like charles laughton did in every movie he was in.the dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. the seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the mike nichol's collection.
