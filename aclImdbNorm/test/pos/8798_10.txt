the film itself is absolutely brilliant, its that buzz, that rush that makes you just want to go out, blow your wages and loose yourself. it's what the weekend is all about, its our sanitation where we can come together as one and be ourselves without a care in the world. the film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just spot on, especially with jip. the characters themselves are instantly likable, one in particular is obviously dyers character and his views on what "star wars" is really about, genius.<br /><br />if ever you've got an hour to kill before going out, stick on this, you'll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence, definitely recommend it.
