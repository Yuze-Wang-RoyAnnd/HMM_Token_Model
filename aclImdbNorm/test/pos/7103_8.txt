house of dracula was made towards the end of universal's horror cycle of the 1940's and i've seen this a couple of times.<br /><br />a mad doctor, edelman is breeding plants for a serum that cures people. count dracula arrives for a cure for his vampirism and lawrence talbot then comes to see if he can cure him from turning into a werewolf at full moon. frankenstein's monster is then discovered and edelman brings him back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire. talbot, now cured and one of edelman's female assistants are safe though.<br /><br />like a lot of movies of its kind, we have a hunchback assistant and thunderstorm to keep it moving.<br /><br />the cast includes universal horror regulars lon chaney jr (the wolf man), john carradine (house of frankenstein) and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster. also starring onslow stevens (them!), lionel atwill (the vampire bat) and martha o'driscoll .<br /><br />house of dracula is a must see for all old horror fans out there. great fun.<br /><br />rating: 3 stars out of 5.
