well its a great work by aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. it has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. we all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways. so when joydeep was discussing with her wife he says that , 'she is looking for a thing which she will never get' and the wife replies 'are not we all?'. so that was a great comment which after the film left me with a great question, 'are we all sick?'
