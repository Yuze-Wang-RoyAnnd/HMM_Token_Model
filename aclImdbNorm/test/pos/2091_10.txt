when a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer, and a mad biker, together with various other forms of social scum, have had enough of their sh** infested cell, they spot a rat and look for the hole. escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. what soon follows is not surprising. complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. it seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.<br /><br />loosely based on the great escape, 9 souls is by far in the top 5 best films i've seen this year. running at right around 2 hours 9 souls will deliver a story so powerful it'll literally leave you breathless. the beautiful, yet subtle, use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story. the vision of director toshiaki toyoda (blue spring, porno star), is completely mind boggling as he implements a sense of pity towards the characters. as quickly as each character grasps their dream, it's as quick as it's torn from them. now, all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director, yet props must go to the actors as well. this film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. ryuhei matsuda (the son of miyuki matsuda of audition) delivers a stellar performance, and seems to bring some of his mothers eeriness to the screen.<br /><br />i must give props to artsmagic dvd as well. this is the 6th film of theirs i've seen now, and they seem to get better and better each dvd. the sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and crisp. it's very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer, so the discs from theses cats are nice.<br /><br />bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers' world wide. keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 souls; it's really amazing film to watch.
