this is one of my personal favorites, a rare little gem that seems to be undiscovered by the general population. chris cooper and patricia clarkson form the heart of the piece in what is a well-chosen cast. few movies have ever captured the true hostilities that undergirded the civil war, but this one seems to capture all the right tones and moods. if you're a fan of the book, cold mountain, try this movie out and see if you don't think it makes a good companion piece.
