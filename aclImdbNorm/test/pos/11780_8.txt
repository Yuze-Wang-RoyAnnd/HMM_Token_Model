done on a spare change budget of twenty bucks tops, this cheapie thirteen minute short cheerfully parodies george lucas' legendary '77 sci-fi blockbuster "star wars" in the most infectiously dumb way imaginable. writer/director ernie fosselius delivers a winning and often gut-busting blend of ludicrous sound effects, ineptly staged action scenes, cruddy (far from) special effects (you just gotta love the cheesy scratched-on-film lasers, tinfoil asteroids, and household appliances ... eer, i mean spaceships being swung around on obvious wires), badly dubbed in dialogue, shamelessly hammy acting, and richard wagner's rousing piece of classical music "ride of the valkyries." the characters are presented in suitably broad strokes; my favorites are whiny wimp fluke starbucker, venerable jedi knight auggie "ben" doggie, and hateful arch villain darph nader (who spouts nothing but incomprehensible gibberish). moreover, 4-q-3 is clearly based on the tin man from "the wizard of oz" while artie deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. this film's true masterstroke is casting legendary voice actor supreme paul frees as the narrator; frees' deliciously rich and plummy histrionic tones add immensely to the considerable silly, yet sidesplitting tongue-in-cheek merriment (choice lines: "you'll laugh! you'll cry! you'll kiss three bucks goodbye!"). a total hoot.
