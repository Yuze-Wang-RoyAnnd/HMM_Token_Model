in a very-near-future world, a corrupt government monitors everyone constantly with computers and surveillance. one man has managed to evade assimilation, and operates outside the system, fighting to preserve his freedom. an engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work. there are some confusing and slow parts, but all in all, an excellent example of what a small crew with brains and talent can do on a shoestring budget.
