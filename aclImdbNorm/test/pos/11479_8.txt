yesterday i finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie. my knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer, but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase.<br /><br />as i saw the movie, those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing, with some apparently inexplicable details. but in the end, everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck, "sorte nula" in portuguese. above everything, i felt that the story made sense, and everything fits in it's place, properties of a good script.<br /><br />i must also mention the soundtrack, which helps the creation of an amazing environment.<br /><br />and if you think of the resources fernando fragata used to make this film, i believe it will make many hollywood producers envious...
