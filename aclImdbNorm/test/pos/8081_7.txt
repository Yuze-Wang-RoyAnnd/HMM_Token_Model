i like the phrase "british post war suburban paranoia" that one of the reviewers used. it describes so well the kind of films john mills excelled in ("the october man" (1947), "the long memory" (1952)) in between "big" pictures ("scott of the antartic" (1948) and "war and peace" (1956)).<br /><br />this distinctly "eric ambler" style plot had john mills playing dr. howard latimer, who promises his friend, charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting german actress, frieda veldon (lisa daniely) at the airport. a creepy "reporter" jeffrey windsor (lionel jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting!!! (something fishy is going on!!!). howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it.<br /><br />the next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work, further more, he finds his friend charles could not have rung him as he is still in new york and windsor doesn't seem to exist. earlier on a patient, mrs ambler(rene ray) who has been referred to him by doctor george kimber (mervyn johns) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. it is a nightmare that is coming true for howard but of course when detective inspector dane (roland culver) interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of howard's daimler.<br /><br />when howard is lying low, robert brady (wilfred hyde-white) visits him. he calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches frieda gave howard at the airport. howard returns to the flat, charles rings and while howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches!!! who can he trust - who hasn't something to hide!!!<br /><br />this is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as "the october man", but with john mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!<br /><br />highly recommended.
