the one thing i really can't seem to forget about this movie, is its beginning: classic comedy, brilliantly crafted. i love it. see it for yourself (no spoilers here! :-). the sparring between devito and crystal also glows in this movie, with devito as the perfect oppressed son. one of my favourites. highly recommended for fans of crystal.
