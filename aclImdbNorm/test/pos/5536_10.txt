married to the mob was one of the first vhs tapes that i had along with coming to america and grease. i still have fond memories of this film after all these years. hell, i still have the vhs of this film in good condition.<br /><br />the story: undercover cop mike downey(matthew modine)is sent to spy on angela de marco(michelle pfeiffer) the wife of the slain mafia member frank "cucumber" de marco(alec baldwin). he later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this. angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mob boss tony "the tiger" russo(dean stockwell), she also has to deal with his jealous wife connie russo(mercedes ruehl).<br /><br />married to the mob is funny and still keeps your interest when its not trying to be funny. i like the little jabs it takes at mafia life(the jealous mafia wife, the mob boss that doesn't realize that he is not a chick magnet etc) and you like the characters of angela de marco and mike downey. it was the last of the funny phase of johnathan demme before he got serious and gave you gems like philadelphia and silence of the lambs(best thriller of all time). if you're in the mood for comedy, married to the mob is a keeper. its better than the rubbish that passes for comedy nowadays(epic movie, date movie, meet the spartans, disaster movie etc).
