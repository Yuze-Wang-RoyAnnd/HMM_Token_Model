this is basically a goofball comedy, with somewhat odd pacing due to some dramatic elements. for michael j. fox and paul reubens, it was their first film(fox had previously been in a short lived tv series and a tv movie).<br /><br />since the movie is basically a race/scavenger hunt type movie, like "cannonball run", "it's a mad mad mad mad world", or more recently "rat race", there are no main characters. instead there are groups of characters, splitting the screen time and allowing for tons of mini-plots. usually these kind of movies are a way to cram the maximum amount of stars (or semi-stars) onto a film.<br /><br />this one has teams, with one being the primary team which fox belongs to, who are the only characters to be developed. their plot is more of a stereotypical disney affiar, about a college boy not paying attention to his younger brother, who he thinks of as a lazy punk. since they are forced on a team together, along with the older brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. since this is the main plot it gets the most screen time.<br /><br />some of the other silly plots stand out. the blue team is about an overweight rich kid whose dad just wants him and his misfit friends out of the house. they end up with a cool custom van which had an on-board computer (in 1980!) to instantly solve the riddles, plus play video games with the time saved! one member, stephen furst, went on to play dr. axelrod on "st. elsewhere", and later was on "babylon 5". i'll also admit that i still laugh when barf, while trying to unscramble a word a'la scrabble, comes up with, "fagabefe?" this is much funnier than bart simpson's "qwyjibo", in my opinion.<br /><br />the other three teams have plots that are somewhat linked together. the green team is a bunch of frat boys, with mostly beer jokes which climaxes into a breakdown for one when the hunt leads to the pabst blue ribbon brewery. they get a chance to harass the red team, with two feminists and two fun-loving twins. the white team of nerds are lead by eddie deezen, who was previously in "grease" but went on to play a critical computer geek role in "wargames" and later tim conway's sidekick in some of the "dorf" series.<br /><br />if you grew up in the 80's, then there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories. the early video arcade, from back when they were cool is always a plus in my mind. look for paul reubens and his quarter-shooting guns. there is also a miniature golf course and a roller disco.<br /><br />the movie is actually an okay family movie simply because profanity is almost non-existant, and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. the odd pacing thanks to the yellow team's cheesy dramatic moments will put parents to sleep while their kids can giggle at giant melons at fat burger (oh, they actually have a special melon platter? that must be it, right?)
