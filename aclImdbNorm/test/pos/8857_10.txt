the silly saying, "you can't touch this" surely applies here. with all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. that's why i always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when i was a pre-teen.<br /><br />the thing is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that john carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you mr. spielberg) ever made. what really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it ooooozes of slime and blood and god knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.<br /><br />you can't get more remote than antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. several americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. one day, they witness a siberian husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding norwegians. before they know it, the american outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. it may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal earth animals.<br /><br />kurt russell, keith david, wilford brimley, richard masur, donald moffatt, tk carter, thomas waites and charles hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre. it actually still scares me. the alien blood "jumping" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump!!!<br /><br />still the scariest of them all.
