well i don't know much about anything, but i sure liked this film. in short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. in other words, it was everything it set out to be.<br /><br />the story is set around a girl's first love, (as the title suggests) and i certainly should warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here. i mean, it is a children's cartoon. it's really just a simple story, but it's told well, and it holds your attention well.<br /><br />in the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
