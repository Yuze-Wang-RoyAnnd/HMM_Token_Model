this movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy. it probably won't change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging.<br /><br />clifton webb plays a curmudgeon (that's certainly not new) who has a tv. however, his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation. so he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids--as he and his wife have none of their own. so, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately! remember, he is a curmudgeon and doesn't particularly like kids. to make things worse, one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. no matter how indifferently he acts towards the kid, the child just wants to spend time with him! the kid is cute and nearly steals the show all by himself! <br /><br />what happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you'll just have to find out for yourself. understand that this is a light, cute and yet not cloying movie you'll probably enjoy.
