it's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. most early german films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early german romantics like e. t. a. hoffman and others. in fritz lang's "der mude tod" (also from 1921) death personified takes a young man away from his sweetheart, but in lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death.<br /><br />in victor seastrom's "korkarlen," however, repentance is always an option. destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. although scenes of the phantom carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of death as the great leveler are compromised by death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, david holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact with.<br /><br />one new year's eve holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. as the first person to die on the stroke of midnight holm must become the driver of the phantom carriage and collect souls during the new year. the phantom carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started holm on his road to ruin, comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. along the way holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him.<br /><br />perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the selma lagerl"of novel on which the film is based. but i would have preferred to see david holm unable to escape his destiny, and to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself, and to see holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls. it would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others. in the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny isn't the message; redemption is. the driver of the carriage allows holm's spirit to return to his body, and he rescues his family in the nick of time. his repentance smacks of scrooge's repentance in "a christmas carol." <br /><br />if the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. the special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day, and still hold up, which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. also, the restored film on tartan's new dvd looks fabulous.
