du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally not different from ordinary folks like us.what director jules dassin shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for them.that is why they adhere to a strict code of honor. for them a family is not only made up of wives,mistresses and children but also include casual acquaintances and close friends.contrary to what many might find it hard to believe,jules dassin has not tried to glorify crime in his film as rififi makes it clear that crime never pays.it shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss.apart from its philosophical stance rifif is worth watching for its technical finesse.while watching one of the film's most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safe,one would find it hard to believe meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans.this is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in hollywood.
