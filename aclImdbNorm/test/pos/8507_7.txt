i've seen 'nsna' just after i've seen all roger moore-films and i must say that it felt so good to see connery again. he proves for all times that he is the one and only bond.<br /><br />the film itself isn't really a masterpiece but it is really worth watching. the jokes sit much better here, the effects are funny and interesting, connery is connery and brandauer is really a good villain. but von sydow is just wasted and the score is not often good and there are a few scenes that seem pretty unnecessary.<br /><br />7/10 \ 2.5/4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)
