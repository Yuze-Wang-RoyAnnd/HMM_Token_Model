we have a character named evie. evie just wants to be a good person. she's nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. evie also has a secret. her idiot-savant sister has been reciting original poetry, which is getting the community excited about the sister writing. unfortunately, it's evie's poetry. while their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in evie, evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do.<br /><br />what to keep in mind while watching this movie is who evie really is. for such a brutally honest person who doesn't mind telling ivy-league types that she doesn't respect them, it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie. for someone so happy and cheerful, she's quite emotionless when it comes to certain issues. those aren't character flaws, they're plot development, and they mean a lot more than they at first seem.<br /><br />mostly this is something of a melodrama: a character lies, the other characters' personalities propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk. but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold. the acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.<br /><br />the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good. they're acceptable, and evie's world is wreathed in color and light, which makes for some very beautiful images, but it's not very consistent. it's not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value, but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters. so while it isn't a perfect movie, it's certainly an enjoyable one.<br /><br />--polarisdib
