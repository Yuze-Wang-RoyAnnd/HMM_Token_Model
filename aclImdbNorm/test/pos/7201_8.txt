wow! the french are really getting the hang of it. if we look at their first asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to gerard depardeu)but very lame special effect. in a fantasy story like asterix special effects are really important. well.. they did it right this time! it looks terrific. i personaly think mission cleopatra is the best asterix story ever written. in the movie there's not one moment you're bored. go and watch this! one thing! they didnt go exactly by the script which i think is a little bit pittyful. for example, in the comic obelix breaks the nose of the sphinx, immediatly all the little storekeepers start breaking of the nose of their miniature sphinx. (really funny to see)..well they didnt put it in the movie, instead they burried the nose under the sphinx. asterix: "they will never look for it here" (guess again). was funny but not as good as the original. another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music. it maked the film to childies. but never the less... it's a must c!<br /><br />grz da jean holland
