this 60min film shows just how much fun filmmaking can be. it's all in good fun as it plays-out a no holds barred comedy assault on the star trek genre. in "hick trek - the moovie", a group of good 'ol boys are on a mission to stop a group of renegade cats out to destroy the entire redneck federation.<br /><br />can captain jerk stop the villainous fluffy with the power of the r.s.s. bovine and it's cow ray?? she may have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! this cult classic (previously only seen at scifi conventions) is a party favorite. lots of funny moments!
