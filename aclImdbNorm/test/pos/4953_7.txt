in the 1980's patriotism, and in some cases flat out jingoism, was pretty high. "do we get to win this time" a line famous from rambo: first blood part ii, could almost sum up how many people felt at that time. a longing for the style of films they grew up with, flat out balls to the wall "we're good, your bad...now let's blow something up, and go home" while rambo, rocky, and for the most part top gun seemed more geared towards attracting an older crowd iron eagle went straight for the kids. canadian writer and director sidney j. furie brings out everything that you love and hate about that time period. the kick in the pants rock out 80's anthems (never say die, road of the gypsy, etc) to the over the top, and sometimes almost unbelievable action adventure. iron eagle succeeded for one reason...it was f.u.n - fun. it's the type of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous totally 80's moment. you don't have to think about if it could really happen, or if the acting is truly believable, it's just fun...and that's all you can really ask for in this type of movie...
