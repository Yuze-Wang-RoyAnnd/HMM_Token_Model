there are so many '10 best' lists which could easily fit "the dead" - best screen drunk, best literary adaptation, best use of music not specifically written for the film, best use of poetry, best screen speech, best ensemble cast and finally, perhaps, best film ever made. this was john huston's last and greatest film, adapted by his son tony from james joyce's short story and set on the evening of the feast of the epiphany in the dublin of 1904. it is confined, largely, to one setting, the home of the morkan sisters, and not a great deal happens in conventional 'dramatic' terms. they entertain their guests; there is singing, dancing, recitations and much small talk but watching this film you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company.<br /><br />finally, of course, it is 'about' much, much more. it is about love, loss and regret, those stable mainstays of great drama. in the film's closing scenes the tenor bartell d'arcy, (frank patterson), sings a song, 'the lass of aughrim' which conjures up in the mind of gretta, (anjelica huston), wife of gabriel, (donal mccann), the ghost of her first and probably greatest love, a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life, after all. emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, firstly as gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then as the voice in gabriel's head sums up his own feelings. this is great cinema, the monologues superbly delivered by huston and mccann.<br /><br />but then all the performances are extraordinary. this is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another, has the screen ever given us a more likable, genial or convincing drunk than donal donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that sean mcclory, (the ira man in "the quiet man"), brings to his reading of lady gregory's translation of 'donal og' here? added poignancy is to be had, of course, from the knowledge that huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his life's work. death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a life-enhancing experience.
