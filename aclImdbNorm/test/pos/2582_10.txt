i knew as soon as i saw the first trailer for black snake moan that i would have to see it. i was not disappointed in the slightest in the film, which was written and directed by hustle and flow's creator craig brewer. it tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake, but also his own...yet it's so much more than that. it's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty, sticky, sultry blue memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward.<br /><br />the characters are (for the most part) multifaceted and very well-written and performed. the accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly. however, there was one weak link in the chain: justin timberlake. the best i can say for him is that he can pull off crying...it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. however, justin's ronnie was flat, but as an actor he was trying very hard. i would definitely give him another chance.<br /><br />lazarus and rae (samuel l. jackson and christina ricci respectively) have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other. this is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and, luckily, both of the actors were up to the task.<br /><br />the music was very bit as good as you would expect, especially when mr. samuel l. jackson sings the blues. phenomenal.<br /><br />on the technical side, all was brilliance as far as i could see. it was well-edited, well shot, and well-mixed...everything was great. the character and set designs were just right, the casting of the supporting characters (even justin timberlake and especially kim richards) was spot on... loved it.
