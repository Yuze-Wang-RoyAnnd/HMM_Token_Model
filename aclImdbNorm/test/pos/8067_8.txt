annie rooney lives with her officer father and brother tim in the slums of new york, where she is constantly getting involved in many fights with the other neighborhood kids. annie secretly has a crush on joe kelly (whose little brother mickey is head of the gang that annie constantly battles), who is in a gang that is headed for trouble, says officer rooney. kelly sponsors a dance, where tony plans to shoot kelly in order to get even with him for making him look like a fool in front of his girl, but officer kelly gets fatally wounded instead. tim (part of kelly's gang) is told by tony, and friend spider, that kelly shot his father, so he goes after him in vengeance. annie learns of this and goes to stop her brother, if she is in time. very good mix of humor and heart in this film, even though the plot doesn't start until the 40 minute mark of the film. pickford is enjoyable (even though she was 33 playing a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets into her character. haines doesn't play kelly as tough as he should, but is able make the audience feel for him on an emotional level. the scenes where the officer tells annie of her father's death and the ending really put a lump in your throat. the mix of all sorts of kids throughout the film are fun to watch. rating, 8.
