wow....it's been a long time since i've last seen such a hilarious movie like this one!!!!! i've never been a great fanatic about french movies, but ever since i fell in love with the beauty and the acting skills of catherine deneuve i decided to see all of her movies... however i didn't think this one would be so fantastic as it turned out to be. lucky me, that i bought it even though i had some doubts! this is really "feel-good-time" film with class and quality. there are some great social topics and moral drama's involved that are very close to today's modern way of living, which are shown very beautiful and realistic. i also liked the dancing scene in the men's room a lot! but my favourite is the rather timid attempt of catherine deneuve to sing.....she brings it the way she is, with lots of grace and modesty at the same time...very tempting! further on i would also like to express my respect and admiration for line renaud, who played a fantastic role (i didn't even know she acted....i've only known her for her music). so, don't wait any longer and go see the movie...you'll be surprised in many ways.
