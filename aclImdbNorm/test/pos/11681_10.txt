the decline series is amazing and director ps can't get enough credit for making these movies. i'm slightly surprised to see that not very many people have seen this one, or the other two, but their worth unearthing if you want the picture of punk in the trans-formative years between the late seventies and early eighties. the film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band x. many interviews with bands and punker's that offer an enlightening perspective as to what surviving was like on the low rung of the mainstream rock ladder. no internet, crappy jobs, and all out hostility collide in this genre. for new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock. all the band performances (and there are many) are awesome, especially fear who never cease to amaze me. this and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people. it's true punk, like in the interview with darby crash's girlfriend when their recalling a painter who mysteriously/suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out, they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the emt's had a chuckle on this one, and in true form the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house, the response "no i hate painters". how about black flag renting their apartment/rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month! my jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i'm renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400. between watching this and deadwood i feel like i was born in the wrong time period, just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way. the people and bands associated with the movie paved the way for what harder music today is, and they did it in their own unique way. brilliant film, ten stars, see part 2 as well its equally awesome, part 3 though, i don't know what to say about.
