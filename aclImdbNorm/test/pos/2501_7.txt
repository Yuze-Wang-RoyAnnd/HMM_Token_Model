this film ain't half bad. it may be a little long at times, but carried along by beautiful scenery, an immensely beautiful love letter and great actors, you forget time and enjoy. the grand prize, however, goes to blythe danner and geraldine mcewan as..........well that would be telling, but they are just great!
