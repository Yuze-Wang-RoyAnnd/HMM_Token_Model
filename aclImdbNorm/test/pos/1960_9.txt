i have seen this movie a number of times and find it very compelling and sad. the lack of real emotion from most of the characters is very disturbing. they seem empty, hopeless. the story is based on a real event.<br /><br />a teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason - apparently he just felt like it. then he boasts about it to his friends and as they don't believe him he takes them to view the body - a number of times. no one reports the murder. there are two strong leads - keanu reeves and crispen glover - crispen glovers character is seriously annoying.<br /><br />keanu's character matt appears to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong. this is keanu at his best - a flawless performance and very believable - anyone who thinks this man can't act should watch this movie. matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie. only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. it is very sad to think there are kids out there like this. it really makes you grateful for what you have. 9/10.
