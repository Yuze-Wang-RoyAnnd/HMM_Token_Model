"house of dracula" is a good sequel to "house of frankenstein". there isn't as much action but the acting is just as good. onslow stevens is the benevolent doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from dracula via a transfusion(dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his "affliction" but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the doctor.). it turns out that dracula really didn't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse. dracula is destroyed and the wolf man is next in line for a cure(which is successful). in the meantime, frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don't worry, the same trio came back in "abbott and costello meet frankenstein"). john carradine again plays a sinister dracula(baron latos is his alias at the start of the film and in "house of frankenstein"). lon chaney is the sympathetic wolf man and glenn strange returns as the frankenstein monster. lionel atwill again plays an inspector, which he often does in the universal studios monster films. a keeper for your collection.
