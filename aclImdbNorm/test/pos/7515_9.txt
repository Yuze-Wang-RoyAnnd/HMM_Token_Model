read a biography of the late george c. scott and you'll discover why he was so enormously talent. he was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when making each character he played his own. scott replied, he possessed inside him a burning fire which drove him. in one of his last interviewers, he sadly revealed he had lost the drive. this was not the case when he starred in the movie, "the hospital." in this offering, he plays talented doctor bock, medical director of one of the finest hospitals in the country. however, life has dealt him some crippling problems, such as losing his wife to a divorce, becoming alienated from both his promising children and worse of all, believing himself to be physically impotent. at this point, he is now becoming complacent, morose and frequently fantasizes various ways of committing suicide. to add to his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason for being, his hospital has come under siege by students and neighborhood protesters, incompetent doctors like dr. welbeck (richard dysart) and a mysterious md. who is killing both patients and doctors alike, because he believes he is "the wrath of the lamb." (barnard hughes). few choices are left to bock. one is promising doctor brubaker (robert walden) whom he confides in by saying, "if there were an oven around here, i would put my head in it." the second is a luscious young woman, named barbara who is attracted to bock because he acts like a wounded bear. paddy chayefsky wrote the screen-play and arthur hiller did an extremely good job of directing this dramatically interesting, dark story, but a vehicle nonetheless, lit by the fire of george c. scott. ****
