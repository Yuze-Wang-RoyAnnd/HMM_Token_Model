when dirty dancing was on tv in the middle of last year i was out so i didn't get to see it, my mum swore that i had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere. anyway getting to the point she couldn't find her video so for christmas i bought her the dvd, well she hasn't had a look in. it sat around for a while then one night i decided to take it upstairs to watch and i fell in love with it. this is a great film with lots of lovely scenes! i love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it! it's definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch dirty dancing again and again! dirty dancing - the way love is meant to be!
