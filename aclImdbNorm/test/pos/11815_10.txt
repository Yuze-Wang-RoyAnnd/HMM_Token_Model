i remember when this film came out, and watched it a few times on vhs. i was so glad when it was finally released on dvd. i was hoping for widescreen, but at the point would take what was available. i love how they used color in the film, the outdoor scenes are so alive with color. the trees are the greenest i've ever seen. most of the film was shot in stillwater, minnesota, a beautiful town located on the st. croix river. they must have really scouted locations for filming, because they did a great job. the story is well written, and directed. i would rate this as one of peter horton's best. i'm also surprised that andrew dintenfass (the director of photography) hasn't done more. he did an incredible job. the acting also rates up there. it's amazing to see two actors of such a young age pull off this type of film. annabella sciorra did a great job as dexter's mother. who wouldn't want her as a mother.
