tomorrow is another day is not the sequel to gone with the wind but a lovers-on-the-lam story, and a surprisingly alert and moving one as well. for a supposed hack relegated to b-minus features like the devil thumbs a ride, felix feist proves adept at filling his work with unexpected, inventive details. steve cochran leaves prison after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13, and now he's still a tentative, gawky pubescent operating inside a man's hulky frame. lonesome, he visits a 10-cents-a-dance palace and falls for brassy, grasping ruth roman. but the sudden shooting of her police-bigwig boyfriend causes the ill-matched couple to hit the road, ending, like the joads, in a california migrant-worker camp. <br /><br />roman's the revelation; in her best-known role, as farley granger's fiancee in hitchcock's strangers on a train, she was ill- and under-used. here she modulates persuasively from bottle-blonde taxi dancer to sacrificing wife and mother-to-be (and a brunette, to boot). cochran's almost as good, waffling between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of an under-socialized male. and the ending, while unconvincing, is nonetheless welcome. along with they live by night and gun crazy, tomorrow is another day displays a redeeming sweetness and warmth that belie its film-noir pedigree.
