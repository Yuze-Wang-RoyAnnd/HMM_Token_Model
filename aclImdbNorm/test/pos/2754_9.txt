others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. i think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. the feet, the faces, the overall view. unfortunately, it falls a bit short. but, having said that, watching colin dunne is nevertheless gratifying. it's an interesting contrast to michael flatley in the original video. the progression of the show is evident, changes from the original dublin production are evident.<br /><br />"trading taps" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion. tarik winston is unbelievable, as is his partner in the piece.<br /><br />i think the audio was better in this version than the original video production (1995). in dolby 5.1 on dvd it's excellent.<br /><br />despite the flawed videography, it's a must-own for riverdance fans.
