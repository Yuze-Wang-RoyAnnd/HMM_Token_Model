flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best american films i have seen this year. neil labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while ren'ee zellweger and morgan freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. chris rock, greg kinnear aaron eckhart, crispin glover and allison janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. the greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.
