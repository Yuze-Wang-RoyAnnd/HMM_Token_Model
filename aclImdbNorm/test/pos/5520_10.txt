look, this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies. but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie. she is smokin' hot and a great little actress to boot! these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson! nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film. my friends bob, bill and dennis agree.. lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard. but as soon as lisa hits the screen, things really start hopping. the others are clearly not in her league. this is not the exorcist but as i said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, this is the one to see!
