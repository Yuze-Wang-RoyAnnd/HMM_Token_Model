i finally managed to get myself a copy of dario argento's opera, and i tell you ... that was about time !! it was the last argento movie i had yet to see and i'm a fan of most of his work. i reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint ( like phenomena ). but the plot idea of opera always appealed to me and it turns out i was right !! i enjoyed every shot in opera and i was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last. out of all the argento movies, opera went straight to the number one spot and i hope i can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well.<br /><br />the script and plot-idea of opera is rather simple. especially compared to argento's previous movie phenomena that had too many ideas in it, and ended up being a mess. the plot of opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it's an excellent satiric comment - almost a spoof - towards the opponents of explicit violence. ***spoilers*** a young opera singer ( the gorgeous cristina marsillach ) is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer. during every massacre he commits, he forces betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open. there are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them, they're getting torn apart. ***end spoilers***. to this simple - yet effective - idea, argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens, the classic piece ( and curse ) of macbeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music. especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value. ancient masters like edgar allen poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them, and dario argento knows it as well. <br /><br />the violence and gore is very well presented in opera and that's what makes this a true argento picture. his best in my opinion with profondo rosso as a close second. i surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you. especially for fans of the ( italian ) horror business, this is an absolute must ! favorite "rewind"-scene : argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where betty's friend is getting shot in the eye while she's trying to see who's in front of the door.
