ok, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame stuart gordon movie called "death bed" that came out a few years back, because this one is "the bed that eats". and how do i even begin to describe this? well, for starters, obviously there is a bed that eats. this is as a result of demon teardrops, which of course affect most things, i guess, in a negative way. the bed is in some old servant's quarters or something, and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time. we have a narrator, who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting, and collects all the non-edible goodies (jewelry, etc) that the bed passes on. he died of consumption, one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him hacking blood into hankies.....bleah. the thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan. the movie is divided into several "acts", i guess, "breakfast, lunch, dinner, & just desserts". for fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre, well, this may just be right up your alley. all i can say is you have to see this one to believe it, it pretty well defies description. 8 out of 10 stars.
