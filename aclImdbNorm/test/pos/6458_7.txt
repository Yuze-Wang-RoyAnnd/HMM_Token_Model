axel nordman (cassavetes) shows up on the new york dockyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. he gets one on condition that he pay a kick back to surly crew boss jack warden. while there, he strikes up a friendship with black man sydney poitier that unfortunately leads to a gut-wrenching moral dilemma for a man who, we learn, typically runs from his problems.<br /><br />the movie looks like oscar winner on the waterfront, feels like on the waterfront, and most importantly, plays much like that 1954 kazan production. however, its racial theme is ground-breaking for the time. the black poitier and the white cassavetes are treated as equals in every respect. it might even be called the first of the black-white "buddy" pictures that would later dominate so many action films.<br /><br />it helps that the two leads play so well off each other. nonetheless, the movie's central flaw is failing to indicate why crew-boss poitier pushes a friendship with the dour cassavetes in the first place. he really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer. but why he would cross racial barriers to do so is never really suggested. one possible explanation is that poitier wants to use cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with other crew-boss warden, but then comes to genuinely like the guy. there's a hint of that in some of cassavetes's suspicious reactions, but beyond that, the relationship appears unmotivated.<br /><br />if there's a single stage shot in the entire movie, i couldn't spot it. everything is done on seedy new york location, without the usual movie extras. in that sense, it's an anti-hollywood production, carefully deglamorized even down to the night club scene which itself looks like a real after-hours crowd. i suppose sociologists would dub this rather raw slice-of-life "a glimpse of the working poor".<br /><br />yet, for all its virtues, which are many, the film remains too close to the brando-kazan movie for comfort. here, a fine unknown actress kathleen maguire gets the role of the redemptive girl friend, warden the role of the corrupt labor boss, while cassavetes, like brando, must suffer a bloody beating before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing. still and all, despite the derivative nature, the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original force to merit a look-see.
