this is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, that really is. if you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. you could describe fosca as manipulative, but what if it is really serious, that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered. but what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly. wouldn't you fight for it. at least i think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness. and it reminds me of the fact how i, as a man, react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of fosca and don't look further at the person she is or might be. this movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. how do i now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? what i think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that ettore scola made it absolutely believable that giorgio falls in love with fosca.
