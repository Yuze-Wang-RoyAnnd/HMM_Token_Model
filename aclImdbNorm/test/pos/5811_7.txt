as a great fan of the hammer studios and enthusiastic watcher of their gothic horror films, i wonder what took me so long to start watching their tv-series "hammer house of horror", which only ran for one season in 1980. now that i've seen the first four episodes of the show, i can say that it easily satisfies my expectations so far. while this first episode "witching time" is maybe not the most imaginative horror story ever told, and doesn't quite deliver the marvelous gothic atmosphere that i love hammer's films from the 50s to the 70s for, it doubtlessly does accomplish to tell a surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepiness within fifty minutes. film score composer david winter (jon finch) is tormented by the 17th century witch lucinda (patricia quinn)... while he story may be simple, but for a running time of less than an hour, it is effective and delivers many creepy moments. northern irish actress patricia quinn, who is probably best known for her role in "the rocky horror picture show" (1975) as well as the fantastic monty python comedy "monty python's meaning of life" (1983), is wonderfully malicious in her role which fits her like a glove. jon finch is also quite good as david, and while prunella gee, who plays his adulterous actress wife, may not be the best actress ever, she is definitely nice to look at. the episode is accompanied by a nice score which plays along well with the atmosphere. overall, "witching time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly creepy moments, and decent opener to the series.
