this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. the horror of "a tale of two sisters" lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore; it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout. best of all, the ending does not provide a clear answer, pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place.<br /><br />do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins, and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately. this is not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular. "a tale of two sisters" slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end. even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy-handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place. the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this.<br /><br />the true fear of "a tale of two sisters" lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares; it is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film. it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so-called 'asian horror' genre. indeed, it would be a mistake to align "a tale of two sisters" with films like "ringu" and "the grudge". this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints, some requiring no suspension of credulity, others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly.<br /><br />whichever way you choose to interpret this film, it is one that demands an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general.
