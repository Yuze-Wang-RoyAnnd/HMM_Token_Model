why would i say that? because when the movie ended, i was in a good mood. so many people exclaim at the end, wow! bruce willis can be funny. for those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. he won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did die hard. it's like saying, wow, the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. the movie was hilarious. what boggles my mind is how some other comments made about this movie claims that there are no memorable lines or scenes. spoiler...<br /><br />the waaaambulance? i am not a loser? have you ever seen a grown up scream i am not a loser before?<br /><br />i thought this movie was great. it was funny, it was never boring and in a cheesy disney sort of way, it had a point to make. something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over it's head but for once, i didn't care.<br /><br />if you haven't watched it. do so. you'll like it.
