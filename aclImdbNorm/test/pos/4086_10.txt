tv churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. you can see 3 or 4 every saturday on lifetime, and court tv can be relied on for a few every weekend. so i started watching the morrison murders thinking i knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. what i got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.<br /><br />both the brothers were totally convincing, and jonathan scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of luke. the look and feel of georgia was in almost every frame. if i had any complaint, it was gordon clapp as the sheriff. he just doesn't look or act like a small-town southern lawman named byron calhoun. he looks and sounds like medavoy, and medavoy is not right for this part.<br /><br />but this is a minor quibble: the morrison murders is well worth watching, and not just on a rainy saturday afternoon. if you're going out, tape it. you won't regret it.
