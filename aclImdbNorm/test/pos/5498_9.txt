quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. eastwood is classic as grizzled secret service agent frank horrigan and rene russo<br /><br />holds her own as partner (and love interest) lilly raines. but the movie's<br /><br />greatness rests on the shoulders of john malkovich as "booth". he captures<br /><br />this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. <br /><br />personally i think this was his best performance and should have received an<br /><br />oscar for it (but i loved tommy lee jones in the fugitive as well that year). overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be<br /><br />on the edge of your seat the whole way through. enjoy!!
