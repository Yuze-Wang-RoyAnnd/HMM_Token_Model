taking into consideration the chan films that would follow, this isn't bad. plenty of stereotypes beginning with the black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that "every hindu in town" by rounded-up. a parade of stereotypical characters enter the scene including shemp of the three stooges. charlie seems to move quickly around the city going from sutton pl. to the w. village in a flash.the ending is silly. an obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nose dives. ed wood couldn't have done it better. the final scene is absurd as the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to quiet the one person who knows his identity. overall, it is worth watching.
