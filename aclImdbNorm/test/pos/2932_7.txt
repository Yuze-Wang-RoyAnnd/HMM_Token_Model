i mean let's face it, all you have to do in modelling is pose for photos. the judging is so over the top with it's criticism. the show however is entertaining, especially with tyra banks, nigel barker, j alexander and the supermodel herself twiggy. i've watched season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. it looks like american idol gone sexy but i'm a guy and i only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis! the show can be quite boring, when it comes to judging, tyra tends to go on and on and it's really off-putting. anyway would i recommend it? yes, would i recommend it to women wanting to go into the modelling business? no.
