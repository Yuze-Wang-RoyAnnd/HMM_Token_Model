this film was hilarious. it provided a somewhat comical view of the british club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a funny thing. the characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves.<br /><br />there were a few pivotal scenes which really made this movie work: the getting ready scenes; the "get me a real doctor" scene; the white background scene showing each character in a total state of being wrecked, ending with the infamous line "what was i saying?" and the comedown-sunup scenes. i have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviour.<br /><br />i can't give this movie a 10 because it doesn't measure up to groove, which i thought was out of this world, but it certainly has its moments. the mise-en-scene and the camera work is superb, the special effects are well worth mentioning, and the acting is fantastic.<br /><br />after waiting a long time to see this film, i am glad to say that i was not disappointed. i hope to see more from the writer/director in the future.
