too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for connecticut in october ... this was filmed in new zealand ...this martha moxley case had been 'cold' for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep it alive and when mark fuhrman decided he did not want to be remembered only for his involvement in the nicole simpson case .... which could have been deleterious to his reputation (if it already hadn't)... anyway, he followed along as the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships martha formed .... unattended boys coming of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always looped ...<br /><br />plus the fact that they portray the real martha as if she were a movie star... she was a cute sweet girl next door type. other than that, the other characters were really great, especially jon foster and toby moore, who played as michael skakel and tommy skakel respectively. they were good as well, the costumers had to keep it all in the 70s look and back up to the 90s ....<br /><br />it kept my interest even when i caught on about the skakel guy ....
