this movie brings back so many memories for me! i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it! my dad and i would always watch the "ernest movies" together. we hadn't seen any of them in several years and i found a couple of them really cheap. we watched them and could not stop laughing. i love all of the "ernest movies," but this one is my favorite.<br /><br />spoiler part! <br /><br />the part i remember most is the "magnet" part. my dad still does the electric chair scene! <br /><br />end spoiler!<br /><br />this is a very cheesy movie...but a great one! it's perfect for families (it isn't like a lot of the trash out there) but at the same time adults can laugh too! if you like physical humor (like facial expressions and the way people move) then this is the movie for you!
