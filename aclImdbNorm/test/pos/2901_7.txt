this was the second cinemascope spectacle that fox produced after the robe. notice how some of the roman sets are redressed to pass for egyptian sets. the film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (alfred newman and bernard herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). however, the principal acting is a bit weak. edmund purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. the best performances come from peter ustinov as the one-eyed slave and polish actress bella darvi as the babylonian temptress "nefer". i find this movie in general to be strong on plot which is rare for these large spectacles produced at the time. all in all, the film does an interesting and entertaining job of social commentary on what egyptian society might have looked like.
