i'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on imdb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. this is the definition of being a horror film. i consider myself to be a big horror fan and i must say that this house delivers the goods. house of wax is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part. the town is creepy and i'm just gonna stop there. because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins. trust me when i say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it. it's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it's killing scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are decently drawn with the actors giving them gobs of personality. paris hilton included whom does quite well with her part. the film lies a little on the shallow side but it's so much fun and who cares. this movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it. go see house of wax the film that features skin being peeled, super glued lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax sprayed on a still living person, a finger being cut off, a decapitation, a pole through the head and much more. i was lucky enough to witness this film at the tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film. and boy do they have something to be proud of house of wax is the scariest roller coater ride of the year! 9/10
