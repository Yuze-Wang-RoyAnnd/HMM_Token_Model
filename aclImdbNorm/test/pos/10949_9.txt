i'm not sure what version of the film i saw, but it was very entertaining.<br /><br />i did not know who the "twins" were (gillian chung and charlene choi) before seeing this movie and i think the english translation of the title is somewhat misleading.<br /><br />the martial arts are very nicely done. i especially liked them, because there was a lot of judo/grappling that was filmed very nicely. donnie yen (see him in hero, great performance) as a director is great as he knows how to shoot these scenes.<br /><br />everything seemed to flow for me, except there is one scene where the girls are on the rooftop fighting with bamboo poles. it has really nothing to do with the plot, but it's still entertaining.<br /><br />overall, this is one of the better (modern) hk action flicks i've seen in a while. although cheesy in some respects, it still pulls it off.<br /><br />definitely a 9/10
