i also joined imdb for the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but so that i can sing its praises. i had never heard of this movie (it's packaged so horribly that it's easy to see why it may get passed over) but a good friend suggested it to me and i'm so glad she did. it's a gem of a film. the actors are great (kathy bates and meredith eaton in particular) and look like they are truly having a fun time. sure at times it was a bit over the top, but i cannot remember the last time i laughed so hard or so many times over the course of two hours. if you love to laugh, then you owe it to yourself to see this film.<br /><br />highly recommended.
