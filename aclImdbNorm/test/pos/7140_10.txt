this is more than a sat. afternoon special. exremely well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it. catch the cat companion/scout for instance. it not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book. the comic industry (as well as the film's publicists) missed the boat on this. one of the least know really great films. a great script by john sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well. probably the best "super hero" film i've ever seen. short on special effects but long on believability. this one's a keeper. i have never seen a dvd of this film but i used to own a vhs version. good hunting
