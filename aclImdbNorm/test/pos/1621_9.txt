i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie. there's a lot of famous rome monuments and historical locations.it is from the same writer and director from the da vinci code. tom hanks stars along with ewan mcgregor and ayelet zurer. the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the illuminati. the plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. its a race all of rome following the illuminati trail to get to the illuminati secret meeting place. while racing against time to find the path of the illuminati. over all its a movie worth seeing hell i watched it 3 times and i still like it so in the end go buy it. it is a lot better than the movie 2010. and the ending has one awesome plot twist.
