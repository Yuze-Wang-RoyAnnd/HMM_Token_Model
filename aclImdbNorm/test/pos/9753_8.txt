hunt for justice is about the setup of slobadon milosevic for his trial in the hague. while it was a little too clinical in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very depressing very quickly. a canadian judge, louise arbour, becomes the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the un in yugoslavia. she battles everyone to pull out the evidence that sent milosevic to trial. not a bad docu-drama with class a directing and production work. the 'evidence' was disturbing by the shear discussion of the facts, happily they didn't go into too much detail and no real pictures of the tortured.
