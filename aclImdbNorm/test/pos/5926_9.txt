the word impossible has led many to select a particular view concerning any incredible task. in 1927, it was believed no man could fly the breath of the atlantic ocean. many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort. nevertheless, it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination. such then is the heart of this movie called "the spirit of st. louis." the actor chosen for this historic film is none other than america's own james stewart who convincingly plays charles lindbergh. although there are many facets of lindbergh's life, the segment featured here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the atlantic. the story is an interesting one and for stewards' fans compelling to say the least. seeking enough funds to build a special aircraft, to the fateful decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in may 1927, 'luck lindy' as he was christened, endured enormous risks, which are featured in this superb film. other notables which helped make this film believable are murray hamilton who plays bud gurney, bartlett robinson as ben mahoney, arthur space and charles watts as o.w. schultz. the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on its debut, it has since become a classic in it's own right. well done! ****
