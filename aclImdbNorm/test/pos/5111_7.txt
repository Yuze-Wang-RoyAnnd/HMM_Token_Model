this was easily one of the weirder of the ernest movies, especially in regards to the production design. what was up with the pink guard uniforms? sadly, this film probably destroyed the ernest series, turning the series into a straight-to-video series. however, jim varney gave one of his better performances by playing nash, his criminal alter ego. a misstep in the series, but wasn't too bad in most regards.(the electro man routine was classic)
