i had seen this movie before, but i could not remember it was this fantastic: it has a fun plot, madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc. causing a commotion. and the music is just perfect! and the happy ending! who's that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me. in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen! 10/10
