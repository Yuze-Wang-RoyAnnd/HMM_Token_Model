h.g. cluozot had difficulties working in france after he had made "le corbeau" in 1943 which was produced by the german company and later judged by french as a piece of anti-french propaganda. louis jouvet, an admirer of clouzot's work, invited him to direct a thriller "quai des orfevres" where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in paris music hall. without each other knowledge, the seductive cabaret singer jenny lamoure (suzy delair) and her jealous piano-accompanist husband maurice who is madly in love with her (bertrand blier, father of director bertrand blier) trying to cover up (without each other's knowledge) what they believe to be their involvement in the murder? enters tenacious policeman (louis jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderfully cynic and sentimental in the same time performance. "his character, his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "quai des orfevres", witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback of h.g. cluozot, the fine director, "french hitchcock".
