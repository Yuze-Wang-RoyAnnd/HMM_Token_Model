silent historical drama based on the story of anne boleyn, newly arrived lady-in-waiting to the queen who catches the lustful eye of henry viii, bad-tempered king of england who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court jester, watch jousts, and chase around after young beauties who jump out of cakes and assorted attractive females around the castle. well, he's soon annulled his marriage, married anne, and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir. she fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another lady-in-waiting. meanwhile, anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant, perturbed, or downright ready to burst into tears. she just doesn't come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!).<br /><br />this film is a solid piece of entertainment, with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours - plus i enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print. emil jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-done portrayal of king henry the eighth - he really seemed like he was henry the eighth. i am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays anne, seemed a bit over the top. the dvd of this film features an appropriate, nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story. quite a good film.
