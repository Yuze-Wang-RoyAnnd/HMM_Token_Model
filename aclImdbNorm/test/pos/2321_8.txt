down periscope is not a "great movie". but then again very few flicks are. so if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a "great movie", without the capitals. no sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine. they are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. they must take on the entire us-navy with it's nuclear submarines. but they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome. but you root for those underdogs and this makes it a very entertaining movie. watch and enjoy ******** (eight stars that is)
