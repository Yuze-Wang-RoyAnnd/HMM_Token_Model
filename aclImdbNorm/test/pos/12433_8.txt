before watching this movie from beginning to end, i happened to just catch the last half hour. ordinarily i don't watch a movie if i haven't seen it from the beginning, but a friend had it on and once i started watching it i couldn't stop.<br /><br />i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release. this is quite a funny movie (often gallows humor) , and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing. the monster makes leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is a like a cross between a world war i german artillery vehicle and a giant coffin.<br /><br />a timid twenty-five year-old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married. his ex-best friend tags along and rags on him constantly. they're menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. they also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy aimee brooks.<br /><br />i also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary, and the electronic press kit and i found those both to be interesting. i would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too, but i have so many other movies to watch i've never seen before....
