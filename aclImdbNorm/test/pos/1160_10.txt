this is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. it is about history, america, the change of times, teddy roosevelt, morocco, a kidnapped american and her children, and the leader of the berbers, with the blood of the prophet in his veins.<br /><br />this movie is based on a true story--like jesse james was a banker. an american was kidnapped in morocco and the marines went part-way to the shores of tripoli to rescue him. so much for that. you know hollywood. sean connery is the berber chieftain and muslim leader. candice bergan is the guy who was kidnapped, along with her two kids; the son is rex harrison's grandson, simon, no less. john huston is secretary of state, with a great john-huston-style straight line at a state dinner, watch out for it. brian kieth is teddy roosevelt, all-american, all-male, a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today.<br /><br />the sweep and beauty of the desert and morocco are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film, which will stay with you, a haunting and compelling memory. the score is as sweeping and exotic as the images.<br /><br />this is a story about two cultures, both with grand ideas and historic pasts, struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another. in any event, the struggle comes down to might versus ingenuity.<br /><br />then at the last, there is the little boy--remember the little boy? what do you think he thinks?
