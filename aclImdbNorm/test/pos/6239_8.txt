despite a silly premise,ridiculous plot devices and low budget,tourist trap<br /><br />manages to be striking. an inventive ,beautifully scored film,a must see. you have to throw rationality out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do if you can manage that,you will be in for a pleasant surprise. also take note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror films that wasn't spoiled by numerous sequels.
