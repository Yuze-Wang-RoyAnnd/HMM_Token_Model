i saw it in europe-plex. great movie!! <br /><br />this film is an exploration of the spirit and the flesh in modern times. protagonist jim kirk, drives an unwieldy rv across america, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. he is middle-aged and confused . he fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. he is the flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. <br /><br />the spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field. the spirit eventually collides with the flesh and kirk goes down, unable to comprehend what has happened to him. he's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to he waywardness of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. we're all in the same denial and so we, like kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him.
