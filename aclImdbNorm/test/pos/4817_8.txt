the world is going to miss john frankenheimer. this was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second, but don't let that dissuade you from seeking it out. frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast.<br /><br />someone else has already pointed them out, but i also want to talk up james gregory and whit bissell in two key supporting roles. both would work for frankenheimer again -- gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in "the manchurian candidate" -- and they do good work for him here.<br /><br />if the whole thing seems too simple in the end, that's merely because frankenheimer and writer robert dozier chose to tell a simple story, and they do it well. keep a lookout for it -- turner classic movies just might show it again.
