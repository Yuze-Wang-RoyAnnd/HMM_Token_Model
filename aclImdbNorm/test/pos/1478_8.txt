i'm rating this pretty high just because of sam elliott. i could've done without the female nudity but i'd sit through almost any nonsense in order to see sam strut his stuff. he gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms, many of which i agree with, and it's a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be. my boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which ed harris had a hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!) who was a little overeager to prove himself. you can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like sam, you'll like this. you could say i'm biased, but who isn't in some way? i'd buy this on dvd in a heartbeat!
