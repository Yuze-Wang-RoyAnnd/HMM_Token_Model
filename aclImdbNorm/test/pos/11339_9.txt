what an awesome film!!!!!!!! i came out of the theatre feeling stunned. the film that i had just seen was one of the best films i have seen in my life. i had my eyes glued to the screen. it's very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully shot, and gorgeously told. it's basically about two people who move into a flat and live next door to each other with there partners, who are assumed to be having an affair with each others partners. assuming this, our two heroes act out what they think their partners are getting upto. there is an obvious repression of feelings for each other, with the use of vouryistic camera work, body language, and symbollic stairways. it's a visual feast, and hard not to like. some of the story gets slightly confusing but that's nothing. the ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings i have ever seen in my life, and visually amazing. the films haunting score adds to the mood. i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind, and respect. what a superb film.
