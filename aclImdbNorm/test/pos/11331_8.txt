the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today, but it is exactly the main characters' adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic. it is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out, to, as they refer to their respective spouses, "not be like them".<br /><br />as tony leung said in the film, love just happens. there doesn't need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens, it simply does. despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective spouses' level, it happened. fidelity, social mores, and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition. simply being in love is far from enough.<br /><br />i had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple (still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film, and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities). their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this, as well as other wong kar wei's work, is wasted on the local audience.
