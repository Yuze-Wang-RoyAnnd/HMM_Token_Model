what can i say about the series dubbed the new outer limits...hmm.... only that this was one of the best tv series ever assembled!! you have actors of all ages, the actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. everyone playing their part to exact perfection! these shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! you can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly! not only do these shows have great story lines, they also throw you into them, get your mind racing, and your blood pumping. the original outer limits was a black and white in the 60's right, these shows made a triumphant comeback the likes of which i have never seen! the new twilight zone with forest whitaker was fun to watch, but the new outer limits is where it's at! if you have not seen: i implore you to please check these episodes out, and you will see exactly what i mean! long live the new outer limits!!!!!!!!!!!!
