i think this film version of northanger abbey is actually quite good. it certainly is amusing. well, it's not a masterpiece as pride and prejudice ('95) but there's very good stuff in it.. especially the city of bath setting!!! ..the royal crescent, the roman baths, the fascinating georgian atmosphere.. that is excellent. if you are a bath fan like myself, you'll love watching this film! the performances may sound a bit too "melodramatic" but i've got the impression that this film, like the novel itself, is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period. the only drawback is probably the female lead as i personally have another idea of catherine morland's physical appearance. the music is also a bit "unusual".. but i strangely find it acceptable despite it's got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed. i'm wondering what would dear old jane think...:)
