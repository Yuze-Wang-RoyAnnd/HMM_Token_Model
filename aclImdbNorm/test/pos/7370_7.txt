this movie dethroned dr. giggles as the best horror movie i've ever seen. the plot was great, the plot twists were even better and the cast was great. it's hard to believe that they compiled the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today! <br /><br />the plot is simple. 4 teenagers wreck their car in the middle of nowhere. they stumble on this campsite and do what everybody who is in an accident should do. build a fire and tell scary stories.<br /><br />1. "the hook." great opener. anyone who is in high school has heard variations of this story on prom night. but they do it real good in this movie.<br /><br />2. "the honeymoon." ok, this was not the best of the 4. it was pretty good and you get to see some boob. emphisis on the word "some." it's just your basic creature in the woods story.<br /><br />3. "people can lick too." this is a cautionary tale of what happens in internet chat rooms all across the country. this segment alone should be required viewing for parents whose children have access to the internet. <br /><br />4. "the locket." now this is the best story in the whole movie. a guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this mute girl's house. very good plot twist.<br /><br />the main plot, "the campfire" has the biggest and best twist in the whole movie. i won't tell what it is cause i don't want to ruin it. i was never this shocked during a movie in my life!<br /><br />plot: a+ <br /><br />acting: a+<br /><br />writing: a+ <br /><br />directing: a+ <br /><br />music: a+ <br /><br />overall: a+ <br /><br />i recommend it to anyone over 13 with the exception of "people can lick too." any parent who's child has access to the internet needs to watch this one with their child.
