after finishing the zero woman series, i was looking forward to the female prisoner scorpion series; both based upon comics by tooru shinohara. unfortunately, i was not able to see them in order, as this is the third in the series.<br /><br />it starts great as the scorpion (meiko kaji) is escaping from the police. detective kondo (mikio narita) did manage to get a cuff on her, but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away. if that isn't bad enough, later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside. first, a local yakuza tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn't put out; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of tanida. but, they don't hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance.<br /><br />soon they are dropping like flies. some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder. the madam (reisen lee) turns herself in to avoid getting killed.<br /><br />the police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer. she's in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend (yayoi watanabe) has been supplying her with food. (the story o yuki (watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but only incidental to the movie.) they try to burn her out, but this is the scorpion, and she has some unfinished business.<br /><br />not the usual mix of sex and violence, this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout.
