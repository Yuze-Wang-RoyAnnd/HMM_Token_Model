richard abernethie, a very wealthy man, has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral. included in the funeral party is abernathie's youngest sister cora galaccio. while none of the family has seen cora in at least 20 years, they all agree that cora was always a bit different. so when cora says something about abemethie having been murdered, most laugh it off as one of cora's eccentricities. but someone is obviously taking cora seriously. the next day, cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently. is there a connection between the two deaths? it's up to hercule poirot to find a killer.<br /><br />after the funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire poirot series. i've always been a fan of this particular agatha christie book and, from what i remember, the movie is as faithful to christie's source material as any of the poirot installments. the mystery is top notch with plenty of clues, suspects, and red herrings. and as i've written before, i always enjoy an christie story where hercule poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal. it might be old fashioned, but that's the way i like it. getting beyond the plot, technically and artistically after the funeral is a winner. sets, editing, direction, and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies. the acting is equally impressive. i've come to expect an enjoyable performance from david suchet as poirot and he doesn't disappoint here. the rest of the cast is just as strong with monica dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance. other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced, i've got no real complaints. it's a good show all the way around.
