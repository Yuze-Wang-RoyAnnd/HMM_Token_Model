no, "lifeforce" is not a great movie.<br /><br />it's not a good movie.<br /><br />it is, however, an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline (and, of course, mathilda may). it may actually be one of my favorite sf/horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires. how often do you see that? not even in "alien" (the sf/horror flick of all time) does science come into the story at all. in "lifeforce" they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable world.<br /><br />now, do i think it's successful? no. i think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one 'villian' and there are one too many road trips.<br /><br />to be honest, the movie is eye candy and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what hooper was trying to do and really create a strong, scary, sf/horror movie.<br /><br />if the remake does happen, however, i demand that mathilda may have a cameo.
