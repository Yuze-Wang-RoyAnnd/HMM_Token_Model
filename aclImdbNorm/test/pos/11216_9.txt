in this episode, locke and eko go searching for the "?" symbol that we saw during the lock-down on a previous episode. michael, having shot ana lucia and libby, struggles with his actions as libby inches closer to death.<br /><br />the most interesting thing about this episode (i think). is during the commercial break. locke and eko find a hatch under the plane that killed boone in season one, and a new training video ends with "copyright, the hanso foundation, 1989" in a following commercial break, a rather bizarre and nondescript commercial advertises "the hanso foundation" (a planted commercial), and the website advertised (www.sublymonal.com) leads the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of lost's storyline. a must see for all fans!
