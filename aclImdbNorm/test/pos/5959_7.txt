just saw the movie, it's actually pretty good. the trailers'd left me an impression of either yet another dujardin one-man-show-turned-film (`a la _brice de nice_) or an expensive, stupid french comedy. surprisingly, it's neither. secret agent oss 117 is stupid, but at least he sort of knows it, whereas i've always found that james bond was stupid but acted like a smart arse. dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humour that one would expect from a british rather than a french movie. the women and the music are beautiful. a refreshing trip into the past, when the bad guys were ex-nazis or soviet brutes, cars were shiny, and france had colonies!
