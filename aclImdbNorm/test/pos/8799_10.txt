human traffic is without a doubt the most original and compelling film that i have seen for a long time. it documents 2 days in the lives of a group of young people, bored with their everyday existence and dead end jobs and taking ecstasy at raves on the weekend. it is hilariously funny and extremely poignant, and at times very sad. in the same genre as 'trainspotting' it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising british stars. the movie was made on a miniscule budget and i look forward to future offerings of writer/director justin kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers.
