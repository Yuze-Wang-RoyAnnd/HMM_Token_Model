i thought it was brilliant! it was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. dwight schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had dirk benedict, he still looked just as dishy! i thought that mr t looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. i thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played decker, and the lady who played amy. it was just a shame that mr t could'nt make the actual reunion. also it was a great shame that george peppard had died, thereby leaving a gap so to speak. i only wish now that i had taped it to keep. let's hope that they repeat it again.
