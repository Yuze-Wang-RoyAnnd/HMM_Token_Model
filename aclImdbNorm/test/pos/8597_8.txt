why is there so much angst among the imdb reviewers who hate this film? it isn't a masterpiece, but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv. robin stone is the epitome of every dan rather, phillip stone, and brian what's-his-name on nbc. a mannequin of a man incapable of love who succeeds professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. i worked for eight (8) years in network news and robin stone's do exist!<br /><br />the supporting cast works for me from cannon (who can be annoying, but isn't in this film) to greene (who plays pathos just right) to wexler (who scores as the young model in love w/ the image of prince charming and can't reconcile that image w/ the true ugliness inside). also of note is the ending which some imdb reviewers claim is a cop-out. it's not! listen to the song "he's moving on" for clues as to the arc the robin stone character travels that brings him to finally face his issues. he realizes the answers don't lay w/ the life he's lived and the symbolic walk away from those he's associated himself with, at the end is perfect.
