i must admit that i didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. as it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it?<br /><br />"return to me" has a lovely and simple story at its core, and is extremely well-directed and written by bonnie hunt (who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself....along with this one!) the charming story is beautifully woven with clever comedy and brought to life with superb performances by veteran as well as younger actors.<br /><br />to those who say that david duchovny hasn't really had a good shot at breaking out of his "fox mulder" mold, i agree. i've seen his other film work, and is, by far, the best thing he could have done for himself. minnie driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny, and lively in her role as grace.<br /><br />outside of these two leads, however, you are surrounded by grace's close-knit family and friends. jim belushi is an absolute stitch, bonnie hunt is a stable and real-life force. i cannot, however, go without mentioning the talents of robert loggia, and the dearly departed carroll o'connor. ironically, i watched this film again on dvd only the day before he passed away. this was his last film, and he gave a performance that an actor of his calibre could certainly be proud to leave as the finale to a great career.<br /><br />overall, "return to me" turned what would have still been just a fun love story, and grew it into a film that has become one of my favorites! take the time rent this one.....it's well worth the effort!
