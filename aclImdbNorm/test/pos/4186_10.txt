a very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did i say weird? :) experience.<br /><br />but on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. it bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the monkees tv program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly monkees of the '70s and beyond.<br /><br />the most important line in the film is mike nesmith's, "if they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it." that the monkees were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record. they said it over and over in interviews. they needed to re-make themselves, and what better way that to de-bunk and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them. and at the same time, they commented on our whole society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "hey, why pick on us - isn't all of this stuff manufactured on one point or another." these are the orwellian "proles" (the monkees represented the persecuted "everyman" even at their silliest in the tv series)pulling down "big brother's" pants and kicking him in his very deserving butt.<br /><br />loved the ideas, loved the music, loved the effects, loved the movie! but then, as peter tork says in the movie, "but then, why should i speak, since i know nothing?" :)
