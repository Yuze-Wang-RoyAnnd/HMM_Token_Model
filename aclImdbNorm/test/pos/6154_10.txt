this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into registering with imdb so that i could vote for (and comment on) it. i've only recently come to appreciate well-produced "war" movies, and this is one of the most thoughtful i've seen.<br /><br />"stunning" is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience. my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time. it is gently moving, yet exciting at the same time (not a contradiction). this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy, action-packed, top gun time-waster.<br /><br />the two lead actors playing frantisek and karel played off of each other marvelously well; and krystof hadek is a very "pretty" boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact. in terms of hadek's acting ability and appearance, my husband said (tongue-in-cheek), "well, he's no tom cruise." i replied, "thank god!" if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting, see this one.
