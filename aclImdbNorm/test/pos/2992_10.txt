i loved this movie! oh my gosh! this movie rocked so hard! i found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (which btw, mentioned the fact that elton john covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about.), i thought it sounded interesting, and i was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film.<br /><br />"what controversy?" i thought to myself as i put the tape in the player, i was curious i get. and my expectations were certainly met. i loved it! i guess it is a really girly kind of movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! it was a beautiful romance, although at times the directing reminded me of the camera work in 'the graduate', which i thought at the time of seeing it the director must have been on acid with some of the close ups they did.<br /><br />ok, so it wasn't entirely conceivable for these two kids to run off and live on their own...but it could happen...in a fantasy...<br /><br />but, the ending just sincerely ticked me off! i was so mad with how they ended it...it sort of leaves you hanging, and i suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequel...but at the same time, i'm almost hesitant to see that, since sequels are almost never as good as the first.<br /><br />i totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over! it's an awesome movie...awesome!
