this is a charming little film, which like many of it's kind, derives it's charm from the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue.<br /><br />glenn ford (as always) shines through in a great comedic performance as the penniless air force officer, married after just one day to gold-digging showgirl debbie reynolds.<br /><br />after the one initial wedding night of passion and a life changing move to spain, the two quickly realise that apart from the strong sexual attraction they feel for each other they have nothing at all in common.<br /><br />however when she decides to give their marriage a go, it is on the understanding that it for one month trial period only and sex is most definitely not on the cards.<br /><br />ford is also falling foul to his new $40,000 lincoln futura concept car (the future batmobile) which he wins in a raffle the same night he meets his new wife.<br /><br />the car is bringing him unwanted attention from the air force, who see it as a vulgar display of american wealth and is bringing suspicions of corruption and embezzlement etc. it is also putting him in the 80-90% tax bracket and as penniless as he is he now faces a tax bill of over $17,000. not the kind of money you should be owing when your wife is the kind of person who spends over a $1,000 on one shopping trip.<br /><br />even when he tries to sell it it brings him misfortune as selling so much as a cigarette or a pair of stockings to the natives is punishable by court martial, so you can imagine that a $17,500 transaction practically has the firing squad polishing their rifles.<br /><br />his potential purchaser is also causing him problems as he is a disgustingly handsome bull-fighting spanish nobleman, who's interest in the car has lead to a stronger interest in ford's wife, made worse by the fact that a rich jet-set lifestyle is being offered and is what she has sought for so long.<br /><br />with ford's sexual frustration rising and jealousy in his love rival mounting, coupled with reynolds' materialistic attitude and flirtatious behaviour around the enamoured spaniard serving to drive the wedge deeper between the two, it seems that their whirlwind relationship is destined to end.<br /><br />but can whatever love and attraction that threw these two love birds together in the first place, shine through and keep them together?<br /><br />not the best example of this genre of film, but due to the watchable performances by it's principles and the enjoyable plot line, it is certainly a fine one.
