i saw "night of the demons 2" first before i saw "night of the demons". unfortunately, my old blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel, but no first one. looney, huh? now, i think all horror fans need this movie. it's like mcdonald's, you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have the cheesecake facotory(or whatever pricier restaurant you prefer), but you can't help but just wanting the cheap stuff.<br /><br />night of the demons has it all: your innocent, sexy, goes by the rules chicka-dee, your token black guy, that surprisingly doesn't get killed. you're slutty girl, you're slutty guy, you're dark girl or guy, the goof ball, the cheesy settings of a haunted house, bad acting, and lots of unnecessary nudity. isn't this stuff great? i mean, i know deep down in my heart of movies that this was pretty bad, but it was a good bad for horror movies. horror fans should enjoy and dig in!<br /><br />8/10
