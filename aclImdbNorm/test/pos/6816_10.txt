for a film by a first time director, this is a simply amazing little film, though i have to admit that it's a bit hard to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch it, as the film takes a definite stand in favor of assisted suicide. however, what i loved about the film is that i had no idea this is what the film was about until the film was more than half complete and by then i was already hooked.<br /><br />in addition to the excellent way the subject was introduced, i was amazed at the very professional style of the film--with some of the best cinematography i've ever seen in a short film. plus, this camera work was combined so well with music and images that made the film just beautiful.<br /><br />as i said, this is a controversial film. i myself struggle with what i think about this debate, but the film managed to make a statement in such a literate and intelligent way, i really have to respect the team who made this film.
