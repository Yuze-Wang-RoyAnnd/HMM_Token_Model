i recently saw episodes 1-4, and now i can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (i've heard they are coming soon.) commander's log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy. it's obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident. in fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more. bowlsby is a master of the put-down... i just wish i could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co-workers! let's just say that if you don't like commander's log, i'll personally see to it that your undies get extra starch!
