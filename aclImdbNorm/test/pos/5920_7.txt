"in 1927 a young man, alone in a single engine aeroplane, flew non-stop from roosevelt field in new york across the entire north atlantic ocean to le bourget field in paris, a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles. in this triumph of mind, body and spirit, charles a. lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earth--for in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight the air age became a reality. this is the story of that flight".<br /><br />billy wilder adapts from charles a. lindbergh's pulitzer prize winning novel of the same name, in what is re-creation of lindbergh's historical 1927 solo flight. boosted by a considerably strong lead performance from james stewart {himself a pilot} as lindberg, and containing an intelligent screenplay from wilder and wendell mayes, spirit of st. louis is a sincerely well told story.<br /><br />in what at times threatens to become a monotonous film, wilder keeps it ticking over by using flashbacks to lindbergh's life. after the nicely told build up to the event, such as the peril being realised as nungesser and coli go missing {never to be found} whilst attempting the same trip in reverse, we learn stuff like how he come to buy his first plane and his work with the flying circus. this is all relative to understanding the man and his obvious passion for flying. this also helps to give us a complete picture of lindbergh, thus putting us with him in his isolated cockpit as he undertakes this dangerous journey. battling isolation {his only company is a fly} and chronic tiredness, it's here where stewart perfectly portrays lindbergh's devotion to the task. aided by a terrific score from franz waxman and academy award nominated effects by louis lichtenfield, wilder's movie turns out to be an engaging human interest story that got a thoroughly professional production. 7/10
