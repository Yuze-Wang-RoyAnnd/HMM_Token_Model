follow-up to 1965's "my name is barbra", and shot in brilliant color, "color me barbra" has la streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. she's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. with her egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she's also a chameleon. her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not ("one kiss", "yesterdays"). the circus sequence isn't as intriguing as the museum trip (with the conceit of barbra becoming the images in the paintings, an idea which works better than you may think). the circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word "face"!) is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting. still, this is a lively, jazzy special--not quite as emotionally tantalizing as "my name is barbra", but certainly a sterling sophomore effort.
