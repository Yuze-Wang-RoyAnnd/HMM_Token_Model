seems like m.hazanavicius is back!the man behind "la classe am'ericaine" comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those old-fashioned oss-117...whereas directors tend to "over-actualize" sequels of old classics (remember the avengers,urk), hazanavicius chose to work on a really cheap hero, oss-117, a kind of low-budget french 007, and decides to do it in a old-school way...the photography, the body attitudes, the fights choreography and the fx, everything is like an homage to the way films were made back in the 50s.and it works, as the tone and jokes of the movie are really good! jean dujardin embodies perfectly this stupid-arrogant-macho-selfish french spy, lost in a country he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority.yes, that's it, just the way the occident uses to consider its colonies back then (and, oh no, i won't say it has anything to do with what happens nowadays in the very same area...ah ah)...he just looks like an unfrozen lino ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role.the other members of the cast fit perfectly as well, with all you can dream of russian spies, egyptian independantists and former nazis.and of course, the women, as there has to be "femmes fatales" in any good spy-movies... the plot is good (maybe not brilliant but really good enough...), taking place between actual historical facts, and remembering us in a funny way how france (and the others) treated its colonies back in those days. it all starts in 1955 with a british spy disappearing while tracking a russian cargo full of weapons in suez.then france sends his best friend, agent oss-117, to discover what happened to both the shipment and the agent... the fact is that this agent is really as dumb as can be, and he slips through the story without even understanding it, solving it in a very clouseau-esquire way. i have to say i had a bad feeling about the movie, as the publicity made around it was quite frightening, and as french humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget about les bronz'es 3 or camping...) but i was really surprised, and in the good way! i highly recommend it, whether you want a good parody of bond-esquire movies (much more fun than in d.e.b.s. for example, but less skirts) or you're a fan of that genuine and candid way of filming they had back in the 5os. yes, that's it clever and (really!) funny, you've got the point once again mr hazanavicius!
