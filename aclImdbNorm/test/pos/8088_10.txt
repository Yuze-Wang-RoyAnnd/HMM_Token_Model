this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. it is a movie both for children and parents, and it is "timeless". i saw this movie before ocean's eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance, but the play of klatretosen is much more down-to-earth and moving. why i say ocean's eleven, is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and klatretosen is that good ! that it can bear comparison with oe. the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to in denmark. the different cases of impossible acts, is handled in a way that you wouldn't belive from many young actors (and sometimes not even from the "old boys"). the story ? again it has things in common with ocean's eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in klatretosen they need to climb up to the strongroom. the part in which the young people has to take care of ida's younger brother, gives a fine element in the movie. try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy, on your arm :-).<br /><br />this movie can bear comparison with most "grown up" movie like mi2 and ocean's eleven. yes i do believe it is that good. it is best to see it in a theater, as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever :-).<br /><br />regards klavs.
