there is no denying it. sci-fi on tv is difficult. there are so many problems that the genre brings with it. like the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent acting. perhaps the budget and the script writing is the departments where i feel most attempts have failed. so does "surface" succeed? not completely, but more so than most.<br /><br />the way i see it, a good sci-fi show doesn't really need a lot of cgi to work, nor does it need a ton of money. what it needs is the capacity to create a larger-than-life feeling. the feeling that there is more than meets the eye, something to make me curious and willing to try and figure out how it's going to end. adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this one.<br /><br />"surface" had a couple of flaws. first of all it's basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or daring) as i hoped in the beginning. also the tv-feeling is very present much of the time. all the way from the crappy cgi (that ranges from decent to awful) to the rather shifting quality in the acting department. also it feels sometimes a bit too family-oriented in that it takes the edge of sometimes and becomes almost cutesy. but aside from these flaws it's an enjoyable show. maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci-fi shows out there. but it manages to keep me interested the whole season and it offers a couple of nice cliffhangers between shows as well. the ending for me is not that appealing. i don't like shows that end without ending so to speak, leaving the story unresolved. it's especially unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is as of yet undecided).<br /><br />hbo is to me the benchmark for quality television. their series have the best actors, the best production values and above all the most solid writing. this is not hbo-quality, but it's good for what it is. good enough to want another season without a doubt.
