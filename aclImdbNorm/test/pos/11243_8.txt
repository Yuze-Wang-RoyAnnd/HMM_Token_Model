sure, it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode, but it is certainly fun to watch. you might find yourself cringing in your chair as buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down, or chuckling and shaking your head when some ridiculous line actually works. the panel of hosts have more of a good-natured, friendly (dare i say canadian) style of commentary compared with cutthroat us reality programming. i think the people who complain about this show don't get the joke. they are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself. keys to the vip is a great caricature of reality shows, sports tv culture, and the club scene. i hope they do another season, and i'd be interested to see if a us version appears. it's certainly a fun, original premise.
