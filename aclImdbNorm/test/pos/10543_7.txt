perhaps the best movie ever made by director kevin tenney (well, his witchboard is not on the top of my all-time horror list), this one is a strange, fascinating mixture between pin and child's play, both better than this one, but not so better. sure, the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, rosalind allen is very pleasant to the eye (and so is candance mckenzie - god bless her for the shower scene!), the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine. for a b-movie not bad at all.
