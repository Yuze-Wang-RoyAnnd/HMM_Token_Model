treat williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really squandered it. don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since. this movie really stands out. "hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the famed peace movement of the 60's. there is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion. unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's, and 90's, the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music. in other words, the video makes sense when matched with the songs, so you know it never could've made it on mtv. the subject matter dwells on drugs and being hippies, but it mostly an anti war movie dealing with the senseless tragedies of viet nam. one of the protagonists is an oklahoma boy intent on making a difference, believing all the patriotic dribble he is spoon fed, and he happens upon a gang in new york, who are more or less glorified hoodlums; their characters are very unique, and probably wouldn't make sense today, but this bunch bands together by burning their draft cards. what ensues in some spectacular scenery and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three leads, but the other 3 gang members, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entrance is easily one of the ten grandest entrances of all time in cinema, partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation. despite their faults, you come to love these people, a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and grand finale.
