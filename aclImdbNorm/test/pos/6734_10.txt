this film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir western - after the ill-conceived opening flashback sequence anyway. the scenery is beautifully desolate, the characters achingly isolated. while some of the acting is less than believable, the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look.
