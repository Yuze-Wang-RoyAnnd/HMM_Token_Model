gary busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend buddy holly(1936-59). he does have a spitting image to the man. being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. i bet that buddy holly(busey) was a much better musician than most of what i heard. since he lived in lubbock, texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. his parents were christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work. that's one of the reasons he didn't act like elvis. he stuck to his kinder ways. that really makes him good! when he went to tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. they hated rock-n-roll, that turned holly off big time. getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to holly and his friends. he got to tour with sam cooke, went to the famous apollo, which the all-afro-american audience quickly accepted them, i liked that! and sam cooke made sure holly and his band got some service. that's what i call tolerance. it's sad that he, ritchie valens, and j.p. "the big bopper" richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will live on in our hearts. i don't what inaccuracies were in the movie, all i care is that buddy holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time, and the music is nearly-perfect. for gary busey, he was perfect in the role, and making the music as well. god bless you gary busey! 5 stars!
