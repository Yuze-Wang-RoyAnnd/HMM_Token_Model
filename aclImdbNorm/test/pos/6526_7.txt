a lb3.50 dvd can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off.<br /><br />a decent saturday night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws. special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition (and why does london always look as if it's in the 60's ?)<br /><br />if it had the budget of, say, armageddon then i'm sure it would have performed better at the box office as the story is quite a good one.<br /><br />overall, tycus is consigned to b movie history but if you see it for lb3.50 then it's worth buying.
