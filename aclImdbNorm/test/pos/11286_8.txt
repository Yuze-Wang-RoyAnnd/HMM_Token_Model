begotten is certainly an experience, and a out of the ordinary experience at that. the use of colour is fascinating and at times, frustrating. a lot of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out. your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone, characters in the way and random cuts to the sky. the sound is very haunting and a welcome addition. it really aids the nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film. <br /><br />as for what begotten is about, the "rape of the environment and rebirth" theory feels pretty accurate to me. but i wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning, it's virtually unimportant. it's clear the director didn't want to explain anything. he simply presents it as it is, and if you want to search for a meaning that's up to you. <br /><br />watching begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but i was captivated from the opening. it really is like watching a person's worst nightmare. what we see is at times distressing and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty in there. if you're an art-house/experimental fan and you haven't yet seen begotten, make it a priority. i doubt you will ever forget it. i sure know that i won't.
