i saw this title again on shemaroo. i also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me. i am 35 and he is 17. he liked it and i did too. it still is funny, a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment. satish shah is hilarious in multiple roles. this sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on tv. but obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today. it would have been nice that shafi inamdar would have continued for all the seasons. he is no longer alive today. i would wish if someone could list all the episodes here.<br /><br />who can forget the lines "yeh kya ho raha hai" "what a relief" "kaat daalu boss" "vyavhaar hai vyavhaar" "30 years ka experience hai"<br /><br />and the title track yeh jo hai zindagi, teaching us to live the life as it comes and take enjoyment out of it. the life of common people.<br /><br />i still like this sitcom. it may not seem as funny at times but certain episodes are still hilarious.
