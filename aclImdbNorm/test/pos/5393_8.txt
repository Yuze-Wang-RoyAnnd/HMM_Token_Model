a throwback to the "old fashioned" westerns of the 30s and 40s (such as dodge city), dallas has a number of things going for it: gary cooper at his coolest, blazing technicolor photography by ernest haller (gone with the wind) and a pulse-pounding max steiner (king kong, gwtw, dodge city et al.) score. in addition, there is a masquerade, mistaken identity, a faked death and more hair-breath escapes than a republic serial. as always, cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure. forget the 50s angst western... this is pure entertainment!
