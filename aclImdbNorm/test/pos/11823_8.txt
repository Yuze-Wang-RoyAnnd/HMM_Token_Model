this is one of the most touching films i had ever watched. no movie has effected me the way this one did. this is a great film and you have to see for yourself. i'm normally impregnable with these sob story movies but this one did it for me. i was in tears at the end. you'll yearn for the friendship that is portrayed in this movie. if i can give this movie a billion stars i could.
