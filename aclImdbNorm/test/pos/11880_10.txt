critters 4 is a good movie. a bit of a twist to the series, as it takes place in space, not in an earthly community. good effects and acting make this movie a must see. i would recommend this to horror/science fiction fans everywhere.<br /><br />10 out of 10<br /><br />fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, sleep away camp, slumber party massacre, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.
