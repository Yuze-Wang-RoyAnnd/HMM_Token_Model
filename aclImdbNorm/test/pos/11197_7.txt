a study of one of those universally familiar, physical and/or emotional states: isolation. i think the film also comments on cultural displacement too.<br /><br />the film presents the experiences of two turkish men (cousins). one has money (and the comforts that come of having 'made-it' with a steady income); the other has none and goes in search of work. neither are happy. expect no celebration of life here - this is loneliness, warts and all.<br /><br />the film succeeds in offering a powerfully bleak traverse across the 'low lands' of the human condition. brave film-making. well-acted and well-shot in my view (outdoor shots by the harbour being my own favourites). a film that should inspire gratitude in anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfilment in life (not to mention employment); everyone else will find a companion in this film. a film with all the warmth and pace of an ice-floe. expect a bitter pill, not a 'happy pill.'
