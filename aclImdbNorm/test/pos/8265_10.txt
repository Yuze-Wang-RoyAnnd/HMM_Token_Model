i'm lucky enough to have a good quality copy of my vhs on dvd so i can now watch this over and over again. the characters are so well played i can't find fault with any aspect of the casting. ok, so there are a few differences from the book, but the old clich'e of love conquering all is so powerfully portrayed that it makes no difference. the reality of living in the rural countryside of early 19th century england is beautifully contrasted by the changing seasons, from biting winter to glorious summer days and this is mirrored in the different characters, from prue's bullying father to kester's all encompassing love. a story that changed my life.
