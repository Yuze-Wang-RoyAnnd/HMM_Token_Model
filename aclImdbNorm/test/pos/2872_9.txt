finally a true horror movie. this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes. i am a horror buff and i recommend this movie but it is quite gory. i am not a big wrestling fan but kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. i have to admit that i didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad i did. during and after the movie i was looking over my shoulder. i have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough. i think that is why this movie is getting some good reviews. it is a refreshing change and takes you back to the texas chainsaw ( first one), michael myers, and jason. and no cgi crap.
