what kind i say about this movie. well for starters, i thought that this film was okay, not the greatest not worst. i said this cause i thought that the script was great and original, really different and refreshing. now i wouldn't say that it's the greatest film that i've seeing cause of the acting. the actors that played each role, seems that they played them without emotions, as if they took the life out of them. when the wife laughed or cried, this didn't look real to me for some reason, that's just an example, but sincerely all the characters didn't act real at all. i wish i could say more positive things about this film so you guys can see it at least once but how can i do that since i know that i'm not going to see this movie again. i rented this film from the library of my school, without hearing anything about the film itself or the director. i took a chance because the story that was describe on the back sounded really interesting and it really was.
