i took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and it appealed to us all. i agree with the other post, the wilson guy worked a thankless script into a great minor character. it is good to have a movie for a certain age demographic (too old for pg, too young for r). it also shows how they think and maneuver in junior high school. you had to love how well jimmy buffet did as the cool teacher. he kept us adults awake. the level of kids questioning authority was kept reasonable. their motives were specific and not like some a.d.d. rebel. the setting and music were beautiful. overall, if you enjoyed holes, this is really similar.
