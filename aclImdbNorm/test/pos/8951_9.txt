very lovely love story between brenda blethyn and alfred molina. the whole story is very bizarre and funny. an undertaker (a. molina) loves a married woman (b.blethyn). they try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village. a scenario of strange situations starts. as good as saving grace and long live ned devine.
