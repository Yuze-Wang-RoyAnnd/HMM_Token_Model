i was blown away when i saw "the best years of our lives". the acting, script, and master william wyler's direction(winner of best director in 1946)is brilliant.<br /><br />this film is about three wwii veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones, but have to deal with the hardships of coming home from the war.<br /><br />the first man al stephenson(played by fredric march in his oscar winning role) comes home to find his wife millie(played by myrna loy) and children peggy and rob(played by teresa wright and michael hall) are more grown up and different than before he left for the war.<br /><br />the second man fred derry(played by dana andrews) has to find a good job and come home to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war. he begins to find out that she is not the same.<br /><br />homer parish(played by harold russell in his oscar winning role)has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and fiance' wilma's(played by cathy o'donnell) reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands.<br /><br />all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes. the stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together.<br /><br />this film truly defines the meaning of a "classic". this unforgettable drama(winner of best picture in 1946) is a film that everyone should see.<br /><br />if i was asked to pick a favorite film this would be it!<br /><br />out of 10 i would give "the best years of our lives" an 10.<br /><br />so next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you won't regret it!<br /><br />no objectionable material a good family film.
