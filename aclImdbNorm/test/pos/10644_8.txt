have wanted to see this for a while: i never thought i'd be watching it in a damp trafalgar square, london with 15,000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys.<br /><br />quickly, that experience specifically. a new departure from psb, it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short ones, i.e. songs. psb produced a more fluid, integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms. neither could they resist song: a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was, i'd go so far to say, counterproductive. overall it was very exciting though, which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve.<br /><br />it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action. in fact the film, though beautifully shot and passionately acted (it has a silent film melodrama, but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style) breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in. and there's a huge range of perspective too; either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time.<br /><br />super film, which can be assessed irrespective of sound, as that's how the finished product would have been conceived. 8/10
