i don't understand all these bad reviews. i believe this movie was one of the best in the puppet master series. being made on a low budget, one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible.<br /><br />greg sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of andre toulon. he has a lot of potential, and i hope to see more of him soon. and though the cinematography was not excellent, and there was minimal violence and gore, this film was a lot of fun. i am a big puppet master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series, but i can say that i was never bored through the entire course of watching retro puppet master. so, if you ever get an opportunity to see this movie, don't automatically regard it as unworthy of your time. give it a chance. you might like it.
