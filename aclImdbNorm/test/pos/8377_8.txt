a quick paced and entertaining noir set in vienna just after w.w.11. donald buka is a refugee who can't find legal work because he does not have any papers. no papers means no work permit, which means no way to get a passport. he survives by driving a friend's cab at night. if he gets caught it means three months in jail. one night he picks up a fare at a big hotel and drives the man to an airline office. buka takes the man's luggage in and returns to the car. there he finds his customer has acquired an unneeded hole in the back of his head. what to do? call the police? without a work permit they will put the grab on him real quick. no, he needs time to think this out. he drives to a secluded spot, empties the man's pockets and hides the body. he now has an american passport and plenty of cash! he drops by an underworld contact to have the passport photo changed. now he just needs to go to the man's hotel and collect the man's plane ticket. his ticket to freedom! needless to say that would be too simple. waiting at the hotel is the dead man's mistress, joan camden. camden is on the run from her rather nasty husband, francis lederer, lederer is of course the swine who had bumped off the man in buka's cab. camden calls the police since she believes buka has robbed her lover. buka shows his new passport and manages to talk his way out of the mess. camden breaks down when hubby lederer shows up at the police station. lederer convinces the police camden has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him. she escapes again, finds buka, and the two decide to flee the country together. lederer again puts in an appearance and buka must decide if helping camden is worth his freedom. this film is much better than i'm making it sound. buka is best known as the low-life cop killer in 1950's "between midnight and dawn". the film was produced by actor turhan bey.
