ok...time for a bit of a rant i think. it's been 2 flamin' years since i submitted my original comments praising this top-rated footy comedy.....and the damn thing still hasn't made it to video or dvd (or for that matter even been repeated on the telly !!) !!!!!<br /><br />does anyone out there know why not ? has there been a bbc-style error whereby the original copy has been deleted/mislaid/wiped ??<br /><br />listen up you lot in charge of itv - whack this on to dvd now !!! do you even realise how funny this programme was ? it makes "mike bassett" look as bad as the current pants spurs team.<br /><br />rant over. for the moment.
