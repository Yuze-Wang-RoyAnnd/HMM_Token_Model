i loved this film, the audience i was part of loved this film, and the little 7 year old girl who was with me loved this film. we all laughed at the puns, the visual humour, and the good feeling you left the cinema with when it ended. i could easily see why it was such a huge box-office success in france. i am planning on buying the dvd, so i can see it again and laugh at all the bits i missed as i was laughing so hard the first time.
