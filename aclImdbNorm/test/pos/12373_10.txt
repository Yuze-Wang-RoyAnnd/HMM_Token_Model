much said without words.<br /><br />this is an excellent movie. it was made in color-not color as in today's films, but a special mono-color use (with shadings) that portrayed meaning, mood, sense and time. it should be seen in color, as it becomes an entirely different film. the story, by nobel prize-winner selma lagerl"of, is effectively presented. one never has a clear sense of real, memory or phantom. changes going on in swedish society at the time are subtly layered. most highly recommend. try to rent it or find it on-line. i saw it in a swedish film class and i want to add it to my film library.
