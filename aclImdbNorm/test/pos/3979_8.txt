i for one was very anxious to watch this movie.<br /><br />though i knew it was going to be another type of movie in the style of revenge of the nerds, i was still impressed.<br /><br />there is plenty of truth to the fact of this type of learning and believe very strongly that it should be allowed in a "new style of schooling".<br /><br />conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know.<br /><br />this approach to teaching should be further sought out in true academic courses.<br /><br />while there still was too much of the partying scenes, it obviously had to be thrown in there - for hollywood's sake of making a comedy about college...even though we all know that life isn't really like that by any means.<br /><br />a touch unbelievable, still funny and with a killer ending.<br /><br />awesome ending. crucial to the entire story and very surprising.<br /><br />without the final scene, the movie would have been half as good.<br /><br />i liked this movie and it didn't have to have overly amounts of swearing or nudity or gross out jokes for it to be good.<br /><br />great crew and cast, story and even the generic typecasting of the obligatory "hampton frat members" was well done.<br /><br />american pie 1, 2 3 and american wedding or whatever clones it makes doers not measure up to this by 1/3.<br /><br />far better than most comedies about first year college with no demeaning stupid jokes to make somebody throw up with.<br /><br />i liked it, even though it was simple...it was interesting and even had heart...my only regret for watching this movie is that it wasn't longer.
