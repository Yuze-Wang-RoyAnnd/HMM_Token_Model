dexter (kurt russell) returns from the computer wore tennis shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone. dexter, ever the college student prone to misadventure, has an idea for a formula to render things invisible. dean higgins (joe flynn) is less than impressed and sets his hopes for winning a lucrative science prize with the pupil studying bees. however, the bees sting the student and he turns out to be allergic. there goes that chance for a prize. but, wait, dexter does it! he actually concocts a liquid that makes him invisible. trouble is, a unscrupulous businessman (cesar romero) learns about it and decides he can use that formula, thank you, for something illegal. can he manage to steal the bottle out from under dexter's nose? this is a companion movie to the tcwt but one need not have seen the first film to enjoy this one. russell is a genial leading screw-up who comes through when it really counts. the rest of the cast is also a dream, with flynn, romero, jim bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still held in high regard today. the script is just innocent fun that is charming, with the special effects somewhat simple, by today's standards, but effective nonetheless. if you want to sit down and relive a bygone era or just want to share a quality, g-rated film with your family, this is a great choice. although it is over 30 years old, there is a great possibility that even now you will see your loved ones giggle away the blues with a showing of this fine flick.
