i saw this film at the sundance film festival and i too was surprised that it didn't generate more notice because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted but very original. the audience was totally engaged and the greatest part of seeing a film like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and cast in the q&a session afterward. they literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next film - we could have gone on for a lot longer. the film is thought provoking and hilarious at the same time. it will be a shame if this film isn't picked up for wider distribution - i hope it will at least become available on dvd because i want to see it again and share it with everyone i know.
