william haines sparks this tale of a brash cadet who thinks west point will really be something now that he has arrived. terrific goony comic performance by haines was his trademark--one that made him a top box office star from 1928-1932 and one of mgm's biggest stars. joan crawford and william bakewell are fine too. and although this storyline may seem trite now, this was a huge hit, putting haines and crawford in a college football (a national craze during the 20s) story. after haines blows off his big mouth one time too often and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets, he turns in a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and gets into the big game against navy. even with a broken arm, he wins the game for army and regains his place at west point. it's easy to see from this film and show people (with the always underrated marion davies) why billy haines was a huge star of the time. he needs and deserves to be remembered!
