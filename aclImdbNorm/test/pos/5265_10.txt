as a veteran screen writing instructor at richland college in dallas and a former mgm screenwriter back in the days of decent films, i am thrilled to have accidentally clicked on channel 33 in dallas tonight and watched this enchanting film in which betty white is gorgeous and makes one yearn for the good old days of truly good movies before hollywood started banging out all this crap for the teenagers. if a producer is listening, i'd like to state that there are enough of us over 60's who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns, no killing, no special effects, no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling, as this film did for me.
