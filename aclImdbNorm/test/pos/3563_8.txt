a gang of bandits lead by the shrewd, rugged, ruthless monetero (a perfectly imposing performance by gilbert roland) steals $300,000 worth of gold coins during a daring train robbery. but untrustworthy member bahunda (an amusing turn by jose torres) makes off with the coins and hides them. unfortunately, bahunda gets killed before he can tell monetero where he stashed the booty. so monetero has to join forces with cunning, cocky, enigmatic bounty hunter the stranger (smoothly played by the handsome george hilton) and cagey, corrupt banker clayton (a delightfully weaselly portrayal by 50's teen idol eddie "kookie" burns) to find the coins. skillfully directed by enzo g. castellari, with a clever, complex and twist-laden script by castellari, tito carpi, and giovanni simonelli, a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with happily greedy abandon), a twangy, flavorsome, spirited score by alessandro alessandroni and francesco de masi, plenty of stirring shoot-outs and rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs, a wickedly sly sense of self-mocking humor, a steady pace, and a real doozy of a surprise ending, this giddy and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired send-up of sergio leone's "the good, the bad and the ugly." popping up in nifty secondary parts are the luscious stefanie careddu as monetero's fiery gal pal marisol, ivano staccioli as a hard-nosed army captain, and gerard herter as flinty lawman lawrence blackman. an immensely amusing and enjoyable romp.
