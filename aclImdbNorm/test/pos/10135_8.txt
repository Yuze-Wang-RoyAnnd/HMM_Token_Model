corniness warning. as many fellow imdb users already know, i'm not a corny, cheesy person. if you don't want to read this kind of review, then go.<br /><br />to tell you the truth, you're hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene.<br /><br />---spoilers---<br /><br />one day, i went off to the theatres with two friends to see dickie roberts: former child star, last year in august. the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly. it was for radio. the moment i saw the trailer, i just had to see this movie on opening weekend. when that weekend rolled along, scary movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night. it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie, they went and also sold out good boy and radio. i couldn't get a ticket and the following weeks, i was busy with more important things. about 5 months later, my friend rented radio. he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room. i'll tell you this now, this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever. when radio's mother died, it just came out automatically. the next day, i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd.<br /><br />well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie.<br /><br />cuba gooding jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nick-named radio. ed harris co-stars and this movie is directed by mike tollin. based on a true story, radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone. he goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around. he's got his own collection. at the end of every day, he goes home to his mother. he never went to school until later in the film. one day, radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing. a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on. ed harris plays mr. jones, the football coach. they meet and this is the life of radio.<br /><br />throughout the whole movie, radio and coach jones spend quality time together, both teaching each other things. it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows, and just seeing radio live his life. you will laugh, cry, and live the life of radio with him. this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others. this is a must-see for the whole family, by yourself, or if you're someone who just wants a great drama. radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen. radio will never be forgotten by me. never.<br /><br />as ed harris' character said greatly near the end of the movie:<br /><br />"we're not teaching radio, radio is teaching us."<br /><br />my rating: 8/10<br /><br />eliason a.
