goldeneye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market. if you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular james bond movie, goldeneye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release.<br /><br />this is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges. the a.i. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer.<br /><br />the introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature. even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head. it is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your james bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts. because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks. aka: you can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, i might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).<br /><br />this is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry. each time i play it i notice aspects that have been replicated in many following fps games. so if you have a nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of goldeneye 007, because trust me, as a bond fan, and a casual gamer i can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of james bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience.<br /><br />(also make sure to look out for its sister game, perfect dark, which is also on the n64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)
