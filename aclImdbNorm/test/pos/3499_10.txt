being american, i have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. i have nothing to compare it to. i have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the american teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, i couldn't stop laughing. i hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. and usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. my only disappointment was when it was over. i'm actually going to buy this on dvd when i find it.
