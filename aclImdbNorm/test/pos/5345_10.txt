who can ask for more? taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk, i admit. but well worth it. they were enthralled from credit to credit, with their parents beside them.<br /><br />i have taken the kids to films before with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, whatever. with this film, however, i was glad to see a smart film with wit, style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen. any film that takes 5(!) years of production to make, good or bad, deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like this.<br /><br />o.k. i'm gushing a little. then again, why wouldn't i get excited? looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed. at least for the moment regardless, w & g is a film well made. perhaps the originality wasn't the most inspired, nevertheless, well told and well paced.<br /><br />too much adult humour? too many sex references? maybe. though my kids didn't quite catch them. too young. so, in my case, i didn't really notice.<br /><br />well, needless to say, i liked it.
