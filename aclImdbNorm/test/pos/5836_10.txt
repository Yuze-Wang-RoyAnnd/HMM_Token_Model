in relative terms having watched a lot of disgustingly bad tele tom fontana & levinson are geniuses for creating & delivering in this writer's book the greatest ever tv show. oz was treated horribly in this country, the finale went out well gone 3 in the morning, before that it was strictly considered alternative viewing for those oblivious to prime time garbage.<br /><br />i first caught oz towards the end of the first series and from then on it was an unmissable watch. my man adebisi possibly the most intimidating villain ever, beacher the perfect anti-hero, eammon walker's saeed an acting class in evocation. there was the hardcore stuff of course - some plain evil but essentially oz had soul. augustus narrates the unfolding plot with pearls of insight while the struggles of beacher, mcmanus, saeed, rebedahl etc are better than any soap opera before or since. compassion violence wisdom tragedy intelligence pain joy brutality love & heroism oz went through the spectrum of human emotion - all inside a max security prison! <br /><br />i can honestly say those thursday nights with the great vids to follow oz series 2/3 way back in 99 were the best tv i'll ever see. beacher assaulting vern in the gym is a moment i don't need a video for - a small screen classic i'll never forget.<br /><br />imagine what oz would have done with the same push as the sopranos given a 10 pm timeslot and all the promos??? fine i'm over that now, for those that caught it consider yourself privileged for those who didn't tv is shite.......and you deserve it.
