it resembles so much to movies like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs that is impossible to think that tarantino's films weren't a source of inspiration to this thursday. however for a low cost b-series movie it's not bad. the plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in pulp fiction. the resources weren't many fore sure but the film is well produced. the acting also is good. i enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor... it was hot and funny at the same time! the soundtrack is nice too. i didn't hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked. i score it 7/10.
