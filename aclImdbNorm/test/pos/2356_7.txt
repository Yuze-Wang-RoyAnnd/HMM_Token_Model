warner brothers produced this 3d extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. guy madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by indians, which essentially all there is to this film. the 3d format was in its early stages as a hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. the rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed. the indian weaponry comes at the audience non-stop throughout, and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattler is thrown in for good measure. madison was quite popular as television's wild bill hickock and is good as a displaced cattle rancher who is given his thankless task by the army. for all the film's polish and presentation, the movie was made in just three days.
