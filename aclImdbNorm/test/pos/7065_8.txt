i can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. in my case i, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. for me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. while some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. when i went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. as i grew older i realized these night raids to the girls cabin that i participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time i thought it was real and it was fun. that's what meatballs (mb) is. <br /><br />mb captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. mb give a great example of pre-teens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. the opening title song that goes "are you ready for the summer?...no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks..." describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids. <br /><br />i personally enjoyed the two campers spaz and fink. what boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? what guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? while these two characters are somewhat over the top i bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys. these two characters are a mix of charlie brown from peanuts and jack tripper & larry dallas from three's company. i would bet that most viewers even cheer for spaz in the egg carrying competition and for fink as he attempts to "beat the stomach" in the hot dog eating contest. <br /><br />lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. no super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. it is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
