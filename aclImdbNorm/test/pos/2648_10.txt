this move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: a space odyssey is a journey unlike anything i have ever seen on the screen. kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development. just with visuals along, 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, no doubt. for my money, it doesn't get much better than 2001: a space oddysey....now, the sequel, 2010...that's a different story.
