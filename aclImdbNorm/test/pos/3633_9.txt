years ago i read the book 'a m'aquina' (the machine). as i re-read this little book again and again, i could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the brazilian culture.<br /><br />when i knew about the movie, i was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.<br /><br />i can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text. also i can't recall such a powerful performance like gustavo falc~ao's.<br /><br />you can see and feel how colossal his love for karina is. you can realize that he'll move mountains and do anything for this love.<br /><br />do see this movie, watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you, enchant yourself!
