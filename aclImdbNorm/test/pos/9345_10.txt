"thriller" is brilliant. it is a long video, but simply brilliant nonetheless. the song itself is...excellent...add michael jackson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon. out of all the videos i have ever seen, this is the best. if you have not seen the video yet, then i urge you...<br /><br />the special effects are amazing for it's time... everything from the wearwolf transformation to the idea of these creepy zombies slowly raising from their graves is grand...spookishly grand that is. vicent price has his segment of bone-shivering lines...known simply as "the rap" ola ray does good as michael's girl, and michael jackson himself...the dancing, and singing (although not during the video itself) is unmatched...<br /><br />10/10.
