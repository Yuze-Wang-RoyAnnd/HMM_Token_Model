i saw this mini-movie when it first aired, and loved it!it kinda funny to see how far people will go for money.it's also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be "whipped". "whipped" enough to kill. i think the cast was great, especially the character kristin.without her smooth talking,and deceptive looks the movie would have not been the same.<br /><br />i never use to watch usa but now it is one of my stations.<br /><br />
