this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see. it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. then they made a movie out of it. the leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.<br /><br />norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but i had a good feeling about this one. even thou i'm not interested in football i wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up. there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players. the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them. if you're ever gonna see a norwegian movie. let it be this one!!!!
