(very mild spoilers; a basic plot outline, no real details) <br /><br />if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations. i saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in maryland, and the only reason i agreed to go...was because it was free. i expected a few chuckles, but as i have never been a huge fan of tenacious d, not much more then that.<br /><br />the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, as we are given a look at jack black's humble christian origins in a midwest american town. the film then takes us years into the future, to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass, the second half of tenacious d. we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled "pick of destiny." again, the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. that said, there were times it felt a bit long; it's only 100 minutes, but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot. which is fine, except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss...and when they miss, they miss bad. same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway.<br /><br />i will say that the r-rating really saved this movie from bombing; the d's humor simply couldn't work without cussing, sex, and drug references. but unless you're a real fan of the band, or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy, i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent. "pick" will make you giggle a bit...but is it worth 9 bucks? i don't think so. i was tempted to rate it a 6, but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres, a 7 seems more appropriate. just be sure it's your style.
