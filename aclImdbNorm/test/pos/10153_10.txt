am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the 1934 english film? the english version has no suspense, looks antique and very low budget, and has unexceptional acting (except for peter lorre). the 1956 version, besides having top production values, shows james stewart as the perfect 'innocent' american abroad, and gives doris day her best role ever. of particular note is the music - the music of the american film is almost classic; compare the "albert hall' sequences of both, and you will agree that the bernard herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version (even though it's basically the same music!). the only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop. i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better.
