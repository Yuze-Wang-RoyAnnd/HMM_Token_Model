this is one of the best "bloke" movies from the early 90's and whilst slightly dated, its one of those movies that would never get made today, which makes it very special! in fact, a very similar movie was made in the 90's called "masterminds" and it was a pg variation on the same theme, but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter.<br /><br />so what's so special about this film? it's the comradre between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film. sean astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80/90's, particularly "the goonies". he also went onto greater things with "rudy" and "the lord of the rings" trilogy, but "encino man" is a good trip down memory lane. will wheaton from "stand by me" lends nice support to the film and andrew divoff is a terrific villain. louis gossett jr sleepwalks in his role, but he does add some brevity to the film, particularly his relationship with astin's rebellious nature.<br /><br />so how's the action? by today's standards, it's rather tedious and cheap looking, almost like a tv movie, but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students. however, the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor.<br /><br />so park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick, but don't expect oscar material!
