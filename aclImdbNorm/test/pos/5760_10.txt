why did i vote 10/10 for this movie that is just completely off guts*? quite simply because if you just let yourself find it funny, you can just laugh until you choke. some people might find that it goes too far, it is certainly not for everyone, but whenever i'm down and just need something really really stupid to laugh at, chuck on bottom or ghp and i can forget all of my troubles and be transported into a magical dark and weird world.<br /><br />*"completely off guts" is an australian expression, it has no literal translation.
