i was delighted to see this gem of a film available on dvd. despite being a 'tv movie' and shot on 16mm, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a 'london cabbie', along with their foibles and family commitments. even the most hapless of candidates, 'titanic' with his uncommunicative wife, it was possible to see how jack rosenthal was able to craft an often funny and sometimes tragic snippet of london life into an entertaining 90 minutes.<br /><br />originally premiered as a vehicle for mick ford (pun intended), the quality of the acting from an ensemble cast including michael elphic, nigel hawthorne, jonathan lynn, lesley joseph and maureen lipman (mrs rosenthal) meant mick may have had top billing, but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents.<br /><br />even 15 years after its 1991 release, it is still as fresh as ever!
