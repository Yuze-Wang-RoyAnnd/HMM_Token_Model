i watched this movie because of costas mandylor and lauren holly. i adored them together on picket fences, so it was a treat to see them together again. this was not the best movie ever made, but it was cute. very predictable, but sometimes mindlessly fun movies are just what i need.<br /><br />the desserts were gorgeous, and i wanted to eat all of them. i did love it when that one fell apart though. i bet it still tasted good.<br /><br />costas and lauren still had the great chemistry that they had back on picket fences, and i swooned as they kissed in this movie.<br /><br />i wouldn't watch this again, but it was a great filler for one night.
