this is the only thing i will be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that rocked. it rocked hard, and yet it also rocked tasty. mr.meatloaf added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled. now that tells you something, this filmed rocked even before it started! now i don't want to give to much away or be a "spoiler" but this movie rocked! if you have heard the new album and thought to yourself "this seems a bit substandard tenacious material,it is like i a merely playing badminton with satan, what gives?" then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece. for those who would want it better do not know what they want,because better would no longer be the d. this movie is the d period.!so venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked.
