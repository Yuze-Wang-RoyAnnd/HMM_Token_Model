hoot is a nice young person's film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls. the acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see. many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop. it is a film for the young crowd, perhaps 5 to 11 years of age. i thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days. there is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids. it's just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed. if you can remember back to the day when you weren't fight for a buck you may remember that money isn't everything. not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series.
