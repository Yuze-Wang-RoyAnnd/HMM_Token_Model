this is a very noir kind of episode. it begins with jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced karen mills (pat delaney--daughter in law of john huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. when they arrive, karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. he then discovers karen has disappeared without a trace. of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of karen, but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. so of course that makes jim an immediate suspect.<br /><br />this is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again. rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time, but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. it's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. it also goes a long way to show that rocky isn't just some clueless old man either. as he says "you come to me because i'm your father. and i'm smarter than you!" this is one of those times where we see where jim got his smarts.<br /><br />this episode also features an appearance by hottie lara parker, who played angelique in the "dark shadows" series and went on to play laura banner, bruce's wife in the "incredible hulk" series a few years later. she looks terrific here.<br /><br />this episode also marks the first mention of the minette crime family, a name that would keep popping up on the rockford files almost whenever they needed a mob family. this time, its vincent minette who rockford helps apprehend.<br /><br />lt. diehl (tom atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police sargent. i guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police. frankly, they were right, though i prefer the later lt. chapman to lt. diehl. <br /><br />not a lot of the typical "rockford" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.
