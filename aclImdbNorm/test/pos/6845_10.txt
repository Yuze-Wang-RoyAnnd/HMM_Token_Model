what's the matter with you people? john dahl? from "rounders" and "unforgettable"? too quirky? knocking emma thompson and alan rickman for having fun playing against type? and somebody liked the gingerbread man?<br /><br />i rented this not knowing anything about it and found it about as nifty a video find as you can get. never insulting, well thought out, funny, scary. i disagree with the naysayers, clearly. i thought the story itself was unremarkable but the great cast, which most likely means the director was paying attention, lifted it to super cool status. good sound design also (much more appreciated in surround, but i'm not bragging). and yes, i'm a girl, so maybe it has a slight female slant (the guys in the gang are pretty worthwhile). all in all, a 9 and a hearty recommend.
