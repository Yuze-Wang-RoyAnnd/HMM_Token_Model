saw the move while in paris in may 2006 ... i was debating between that and mission impossible...i am very glad i choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france. i had a great time... would recommend it. it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... cannot wait for the dvd to come out... i don't know how some of the 'jeu de mots' 'puns' would be translated in english i 'll certainly buy it when it is out! p.s. i saw on 'brice de nice' which is a movie starring dujardin that all kids were talking about in france. this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine...in comparing both movies i have to say that dujardin did a good job in oss 117.
