as a young teen when this came out, i completely related to it. as an adult in the present sex- obsessed american culture, it doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame. <br /><br />if you are looking for american pie-type lewdness, vulgarity or fart and feces jokes, meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee. <br /><br />if you like bill murray, and you like good clean fun, you will probably like and enjoy this film very much. similarly with stripes, ghostbusters, caddy shack, etc. <br /><br />enough said, just go watch it, and stop intellectualizing it. it's meatballs, for crying out loud! why read a review? just enjoy it and have fun. and ignore the trash talk by others. films, like so many other things in life, are subjective. to each his own. <br /><br />always beware the 'expert' who diminishes others' taste.
