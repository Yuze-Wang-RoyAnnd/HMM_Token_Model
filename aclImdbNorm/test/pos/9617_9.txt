i was first introduced to this movie while in san antonio, tx. this movie was the 2nd. in a double feature. unfortunately, the theater where i saw this was torn down. anyways, five fingers of death (aka: king boxer), was released in 1972 and introduced in the u.s. the following year. like a lot of "other" kung-fu movies released while riding on the "coat-tails" of enter the dragon, this particular movie actually was pretty good. it's the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to better himself & his fighting skills. meanwhile, the "opponent" martial arts school plans & scheme to thwart our hero, utilizing dirty tactics to try to throw him off track & try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. by surprise, i had thought since warner bros. distributed this movie in the u.s., warner bros. was going to issue a dvd. it never happened. as far as i know, this movie has been released in both english & cantonise, w/sub-titles.....the latter a more "cleaner & clearer" version. although the fighting sequences are a bit funny to watch (i.e.: flying in air & hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using his head....literally....to hit his opponent, etc.), nonetheless, it's classic kung-fu action wonderfully planned & executed. if you like enter the dragon, five fingers of death would be an excellent addition to any movie collection.....if you can find it.
