nurse betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. in the same way i loathed fargo on first viewing, then realized i was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, i liked nurse betty a lot more the day after i saw it. hard to understand, harder to explain. as others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.<br /><br />fair job by greg kinnear, great work from morgan freeman (although i worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain). chris rock was good but not a standout. rene z. is so natural it's unnerving -- i.e., unnerving to be "natural" playing someone not well in the head. also liked the sort of "abrasive sparkle" performance from allison janney in a small part.<br /><br />don't go expecting as much of a "road movie" as you might assume from some synopses. (there is "road," but it's only barely relevant.) rated 8/10.
