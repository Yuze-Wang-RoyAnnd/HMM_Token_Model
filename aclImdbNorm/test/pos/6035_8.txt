this columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites. the cast includes rosemary's baby john cassavetes as the maestro, his wife played by blythe danner (gwyneth paltrow's mom) and his mother-in-law played by myrna loy (one of america's greatest leading actresses in film of our time). anyway i disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film. this episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing. i love watching columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series. this time, the episode focuses in on classical music at the hollywood bowl, one of l.a.'s attractions. of course, columbo becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime.
