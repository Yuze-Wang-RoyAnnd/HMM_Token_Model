i wish there was a category to place this in other than horror. it simply isn't. granted it has it's horrific moments, however i don't feel that makes it a horror film. i will give that this movie could have been better. a million little things could have been changed to make it better.<br /><br />that having been said i love this movie. i'm often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it. it has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say... things aren't always what they seem. sometimes 'evil', isn't. <br /><br />barker was at a con i went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing. it was very interesting. many things he wished to put in the movie couldn't be, and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost. this was a chunk that helped shed light on boone and his girlfriend, as well as some other details.<br /><br />i know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the 'breed' in the background, however i always felt that gave the movie a more 'real' fleshed out feel. i have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics. because of this, the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story. a much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live. <br /><br />despite all of the flaws this movie might have i believe it has a lot to offer. the 'monsters' are wonderful, very imaginative. while the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines. whenever i watch it i find something new. keep and eye on boones chest toward the end. at one point decker stabs him and shortly after boone falls on a card table. he ends up with a card stuck to his chest. this card stays there for a while even after lori pulls the knife out. it stays there until boone casually removes it. i love that. that was a lovely little detail i thought.<br /><br />basically what i want to say is that... if you are looking for a horror movie, don't watch this. if you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up. this is the movie for you. this is a movie about how men destroy what they don't understand or fear.
