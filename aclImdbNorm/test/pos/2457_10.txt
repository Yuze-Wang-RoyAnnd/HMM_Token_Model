this movie is powerful. i watched this movie at 3:00 am and i was suppose to be at work at 6:00 am, needless to say i was late to work. i could not bring myself to get up off my bed to go to work. this is the most powerful movie that i have seen in a long time. and that made me cry and feel the pain of the family. i think emilo did a wonderful job of directing this film. i agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie that i have seen that has brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, what a veteran went through. it is almost heart breaking to think that back then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. kathy bates reminded me of my mother in a way. i believe she really showed how women felt and acted back then. i am surprised that this film wasn't up for more awards.
