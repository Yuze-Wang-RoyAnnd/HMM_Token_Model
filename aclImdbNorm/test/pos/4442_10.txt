lucio fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'the godfather of gore'. while don't torture a duckling was made before fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that fulci ever made! don't torture a duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of fulci's later films, everything about this giallo is great. the plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up. the murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes, a reporter named andrea martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own. martelli soon encounters various suspects, including a sexy young lady named patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into them.<br /><br />while this film may not feature loads of gore, it does have two of fulci's nastiest sequences to make up for it. the nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs. don't torture a duckling features an absolutely great italian cast. barbara bouchet (a personal favourite of mine) is incredibly sexy in her role as patricia, and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films. tomas millian is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of irene pappas, florinda bolkan and marc porel. the cinematography on display is stunning and fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene. the story plays out slowly, and it's always interesting as fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line. there isn't a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer; but fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and don't torture a duckling does climax on a high. overall, it's a shame that fulci didn't make more films like this. don't torture a duckling is his out and out best work and i insist that every giallo fans sees it!
