we open in a doctors room of some sort. a girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor. he asks her questions. silence follows. he continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere.<br /><br />the story is about two girls who are taken home, after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before hand. they are greeted on their arrival by their trying-way-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-so-totally-evil stepmother, who the girls obviously hold resentment for. as time goes on at home, the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. and, to top it all off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' recovery...<br /><br />this film is amazing. it has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. the relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming, it almost makes you cry at some points (i know i had a teary moment of two, specifically 'the cupboard scene'). but what i love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits. the soundtrack is faultless, the furnishings in the house, and the use of colour are fantastic. a pure joy for the eyes. this is a definite must-see for all asian movie fanatics. or any sort of movie fan! an easy 10/10.
