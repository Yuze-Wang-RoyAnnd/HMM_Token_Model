glorifying not glamorizing world war ii.<br /><br />we've had quite a few documentary series about world war ii on the regular television programming. without looking up any information in some encyclopedia or film book, it seems that this old memory can recollect most names entirely on it's own.<br /><br />there was crusade in europe,which was the title of the war memoirs of one general of the army and later the 33rd president of the united states of america, dwight d. eisenhower. it told the story of the conflict in europe as viewed by the supreme allied commander.<br /><br />then there was a crusade in the pacific(subject matter self-explanatory),which i don't remember much about. newspaper man/author, jim bishop was the host/navigator of battleline.<br /><br />and there was the excellent winston churchill, the valiant years.* the series was a co-production of the british broadcasting corporation and the american broadcasting company. it first aired in 1960-61 season here in the states and boasts of having richard burton's speaking the words of sir winston.<br /><br />it is the 1952 nbc television network's production of our subject matter today, this victory at sea that wins the cigar, hands down.<br /><br />to begin with, this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally sorting through thousands of hours of film. the movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the armed forces of the united states, independent newsreel film, motion picture record of our other allied partner nations,as well as captured axis pictures from nazi germany, fascist italy and imperial japan.<br /><br />once that was accomplished, the various corresponding film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1/2 hour installments. this was done with great skill, being that there were so many scene changes, whether done abruptly or as a dissolve. the look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project.<br /><br />the writing of the spoken word to accompany this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique. the highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes not a word and at times even understates the description of action, rather than exaggerating it. the narration goes to mr. ralph graves, who was a talented actor of stage, film, radio and television. he certainly gained a measure of immortality by way of his golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions.<br /><br />lastly, victory at sea enjoys the luxury of having an original score, both opening theme and incidental music, penned by richard rodgers of broadway fame.(rodgers & hart, rodgers & hammerstein) his compositions are intricate, full, variable and even "classic" in the true sense.<br /><br />the classical arrangement was played by the nbc sympphony orchestra under the direction of robert russell bennett and as a soundtrack record/cassette tape/compact disk, it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release, 55 years ago! and, really small wonder, for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer/listener. it truly puts the frosting on this cake.<br /><br />* sir winston churchill, the valiant years also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score. this also was composed by mr. rodgers.<br /><br />** we had in additional "ace in the hole" in our house in the person of our father, the late clement j. ryan(1914-74). dad had been in the u.s.navy during the war, being inducted in 1943 or'44. our pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were depicted in the series.<br /><br />he and our mother the now 90 year old bertha (nee fuerst)ryan already had my older sister, joanne(1942-90)as a dependant.
