aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence, this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours.<br /><br />it starts with an interminably long intro where the leeds family is introduced, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely clich'ed pa and ma, and incredibly annoying grandpa (played by charles "chic" sales). while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street. the mobsters flee through the family's house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime.<br /><br />the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the crusading da occasionally interrupting long anti-crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob. it all winds up in a predictable manner.<br /><br />good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating, nat pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the gorgeous sue blane in a small role as the leeds daughter. <br /><br />if you want to watch huston play his early trademark crusading lawman, try 1932's "beast of the city." avoid this one if at all possible.
