robert montgomery-myrna loy farce about loy (irene) and her fianc'e, played by reginald owen, stranded in labrador when their plane crashes. (that's really what should have happened to this highly predictable film.) montgomery lives there while he is waiting for his fianc'e.<br /><br />surprise! montgomery and loy are soon attracted to each other. the scene with the bear is so contrived. we knew it was a tamed bear all along.<br /><br />complications ensue when clara shows up. loy wants montgomery to tell clara that they should part ways, when he refuses, she wants to leave at once.<br /><br />you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end. out with all that snow, it's just too cold for anyone!
