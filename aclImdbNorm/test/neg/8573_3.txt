i thought this movie'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher. well i was totally wrong. there's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd. i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but i didn't expect to see a fake hollywood film. they certainly faked it pretty well though. why'd they make a movie without any new aspects? this is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination.<br /><br />i thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie'd be something really original. it turned out to be a teen slasher. if this'd been done ten years ago then it'd have been something new.<br /><br />i can't recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value! it's like a horror parody in some points.
