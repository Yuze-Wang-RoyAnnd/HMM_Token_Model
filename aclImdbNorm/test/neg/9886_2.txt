the movie blood and chocolate is nothing like the book. the plot has totally changed and whoever chose the cast needed to read the book. first the girl is not an introvert aden is. vivian was the one that chased aden. her mother was to have survived and be the one after gabriel. astrid was the one that did all the murders along with ralf an ex of vivian's. gabriel is not old. he is old looking. and aden did not get vivian in the end, gabriel did. the title came from vivian comparing kisses from aden (sweet like chocolate) and gabriel(delicious like blood). she picked blood because it promised more and he understood her more. that reminds me, gabriel is not against humans like in the movie. he just avoids intimacy with them because they hurt him in the past. really the book is sooooooo much better than the movie. but if you want o see running, a dating montage, and a lot of jumping. then this is the movie to see.
