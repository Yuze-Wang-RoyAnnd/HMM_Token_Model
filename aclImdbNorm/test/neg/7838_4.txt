jean claude van damme's movie career seems to have gone to hell in a handcart so how ironic to see him playing a character who meets the same fate in a literal manner at the very start of the movie ! it's also interesting to note how very , very similar the plots of his movies play out regardless of who the producer , director or screenwriter are . van damme usually plays a character who is living in france then due to a set of circumstances finds himself in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies and it's up to van damme to get revenge helped by a character he's just met . look at awol or legoinairre or many other films that feature the headline " starring jean claude van damme " and they all feature nearly the same type of story structure . this doesn't mean they're identical of course , just very similar and if you've seen one van damme movie you've basically seen them all . it's the same with maximum risk
