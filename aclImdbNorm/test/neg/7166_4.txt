i saw bits and pieces of this on tv once, and when a friend recommended it, i began looking for it even though it seemed no place nearby had it. i finally got a hold of it in an antique store, and couldn't wait to watch it...oh, that i had seen it a couple years earlier and could've really enjoyed it. i was surprised that this movie was only 80 or so minutes long, and i think this is what made the plot and story so lacking. the plot really does sound like a good one, both on the trailer and the movie comments: a teenager, angus (jesse bradford) and his newfound stray lab yellow are marooned on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father (bruce davison). together, they manage to survive the wilderness and wait to be found and rescued. still, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very rushed. there is a possible love interest between angus and sara, but they're never shown together for more than a moment. yellow is a mischievous dog the parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days he seems to be appreciated enough to join a boat trip. the scene of the mother (mimi rogers) mentioning vaguely what death is like to the younger boy (joel palmer) doesn't go anywhere. in no time, we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island, then suddenly it's 14, then 19. of all the animals a castaway could be exposed to in the wild, only 1 kind - a wolf - attacks them. why couldn't something else have been a problem instead of having the same type of animal - maybe even the same one - strike twice? there are few views of how angus prepares food, except when he discovers fruit and roots, and when he roasts a trapped rat. if he knows so much about survival skills, why weren't more scenes with it shown? the one thing that made me blank was why the dog didn't have much part alone. when he is rescued, and the dog is left behind on the island, there is no scene showing how he survives without a human's help. i wished i was more open to this when watching it, but i did enjoy some of this. the acting was good, and the score was enjoyable. though, i found myself wondering why the father looked so much older than his family, and why he and the main search and rescue conductor share names. this is a good movie for kids, but though the protagonist is 14, nobody over 10 would be interested with this.
