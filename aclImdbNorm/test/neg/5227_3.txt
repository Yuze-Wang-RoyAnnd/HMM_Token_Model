i am a fan of ed harris' work and i really had high expectations about this film. having so good actors as harris and von sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do? i really think that needful things is the worst movie of harris' filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake. anyway, i've seen much worse movies in my life but needful things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. the story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake. i don't know if that is because of the book, 'cause i haven't read it. but if the script was so bad, i can't see the reason for filming it. maybe it was the commercial success of king's books, or the need for low-quality movies for the vhs era of the 90's. whatever the reason was, though, this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved.
