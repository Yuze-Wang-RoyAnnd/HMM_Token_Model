"stealing time" actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled "rennie's landing". which explains how director marc fusco was able to afford this cast of now established television/movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. about ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago. <br /><br />its recent distribution by franchise pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be milked to recover some of the modest production costs. although not a great addition to anyone's resume, young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind.<br /><br />peter facinelli, ethan embry, scott foley and charlotte ayanna play college friends who do an early "big chill" reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams. <br /><br />unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. yes alec (facinelli) dreams about a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery, which are then "cheaply and lamely" staged to completely inappropriate music. it is the least suspenseful bank job since w.c. fields was the guard in "the bank dick". <br /><br />if anyone can point to any moment in "stealing time" where something "actually" happens i would like to know about it, because as far as i can tell, not a thing happens in the whole film. perhaps fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of one's life before it is too late. like "st. elmo's fire" the movie is littered with every profound thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time.<br /><br />i felt fusco was going for a kind of howard hawks young professionals in action "only angels have wings" motif. then again, i'm sure i was reading much too much into the film. after all, things actually happen howard hawks films.<br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
