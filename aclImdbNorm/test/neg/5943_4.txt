"midnight clear" has a great premise. a group of over-educated, overly bright gi's are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm house on the eve of the battle of the bulge. the gi's encounter a group of battle-weary german regulars, and it becomes clear that they don't want to fight anymore.<br /><br />therein lies the problem. it's really pretty simple. if the germans want to surrender, they do so and that's the end of the movie. if the germans want to fight, they do so and that's also the end of the movie. so instead of doing either the gi's and germans play games with each other, even throwing snowballs at one point. interesting for one or two scenes, but it soon becomes very annoying. after all, these are germans. the enemy. nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot. the film does noting to make them more human. in fact, much of what the german characters did made me want to shoot them, including one scene where the german officer refuses to deal with a jew or to surrender to a mere enlisted man! why should i care about such characters? just shoot them and let's move on to the battle of the bulge. it's much more interesting, anyway.<br /><br />one good scene: the gi's are returning from a recon of the german position, where they had the germans in their sights but did not fire. while walking across a clearing, they realize a group of germans have their mausers leveled at them. the germans are about 100 yards away. the gis then do something i've never seen any gi's do in any sillywood movie. they throw down their rifles and throw up their hands! unusual as this may be in films, it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance. though it seems far, in reality it's point-blank range for those rifles. i'll lay odds that someone working on this film was a cruffler!
