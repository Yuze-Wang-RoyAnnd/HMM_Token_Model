oh how i laughed....this has it all...an asian/white family, a disabled asian boy...everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the bbc.<br /><br />what utter tribe: this was a total insult to my eyes that viewed this rubbish for one episode and one episode only.<br /><br />when you think of some of the quality the bbc has put out over the years (fawlty towers for example) and then this comes rolling in...its a disgusting disgrace.<br /><br />its all geared on political-correctness and is devoid of any humour whatsoever.<br /><br />this is straight from the bowels of hell: but what would you expect from the ultra left-wing bpc...i mean bbc.
