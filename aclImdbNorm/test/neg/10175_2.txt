this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda. it started off like a good sci-fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated. i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it. the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not contradict belief in god.<br /><br />the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable, writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all, this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided.<br /><br />there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject. if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels , you will love this movie.
