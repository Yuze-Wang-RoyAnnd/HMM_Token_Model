this is a snuff movie. i'm shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library. and, bill, julia, and all other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. i thought i was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. this ending was not creative. it was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie. i am shocked it was edited to this ending, and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of june 2009. it should not be shown in a theater. it is harmful to innocent minds on many levels....watch the movie, the ending, and you will understand this statement. plus, included in the plot is a sweet little girl "not yet 9" her character says. she is not in the snuff ending, but she is an integral part of the movie. why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition? the director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film.
