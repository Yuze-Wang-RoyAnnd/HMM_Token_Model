new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in this<br /><br />debacle of a film. quaid's attempt at speaking with a cajun<br /><br />accent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks that way in new<br /><br />orleans) is terrible. plot = elementary and mindless. this<br /><br />picture refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves a<br /><br />gradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film. there's none of that here. "big<br /><br />easy" tries to get by on trite new orleans stereotypes. <br /><br />don't be fooled - the real big easy is nothing like the town<br /><br />that quaid & barkin bumble their way through.
