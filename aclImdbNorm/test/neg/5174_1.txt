watching this movie all i could think of was, maybe it gets better, but after 20 minutes i couldn't watch it any second longer. i don't want too wast to many lines about this, but really its a complete wast of time. all the actors say is c*nt this cont that. if you are still going too watch it, don't say i didn't warned you. maybe if you are an hooligan or something, you might think its a tribute to your hobby. again.. film is a term that encompasses individual motion pictures, the field of film as an art form, and the motion picture industry. films are produced by recording images from the world with cameras, or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects. .
