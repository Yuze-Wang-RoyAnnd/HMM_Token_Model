like anyone else who bought this, i was duped by the "20 pieces of extreme gore" and "banned in 20 countries" or whatever it says in the box. i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. tom savini, rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business. the revolutionized make-up effects in the 80's. today, you don't need them as everything is done on computer. but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. but i digress.<br /><br />watching fantastically gory films like fulci's gates to hell or even savini's crowning achievement, friday the 13th the final chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. you can't tell the difference between reality and magic.<br /><br />i can't imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. if that is the reason you seek this film, then you are wasting your money. as many other reviewers in here have noted, most of the gore is an aftermath. you don't see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see whatever it looks like afterwords.<br /><br />the gore? well, it's here, but not as much as one would hope, or expect. a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts, but other then those two scenes, and one involving a scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned, are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but i was expecting a bit more. call me sick or twisted, but isn't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places.<br /><br />cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film, it is much better than this tripe. if you go out of your way to buy this for $20.00, you will feel cheated.<br /><br />3/10
