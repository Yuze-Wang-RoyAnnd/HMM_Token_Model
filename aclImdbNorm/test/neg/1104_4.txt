j.s. cardone directed a little known 'video nasty' in 1982 called "the slayer" and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films; including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie the forsaken. his latest feature film, wicked little things, boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that i seem to remember surfacing a couple of years ago in relation to a film that tobe hooper was meant to direct. well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie 'mortuary' and so turned this one down. i don't blame him for it either. the plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. however, what they don't realise is that around a hundred years earlier; a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a mineshaft. naturally, that's not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of revenge
