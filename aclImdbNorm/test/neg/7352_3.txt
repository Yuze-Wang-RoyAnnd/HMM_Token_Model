this could have been a good movie if more things were explained. way too many plot holes to find this enjoyable. the ending in particular is off left field. spoiler alert: how did the kidnapper get back to dundee so fast and dundee shows up at the house in a matter of two minutes? way out of wack here. how did anna get hold of the money? no explanation at all. if the pete the cop knew lancaster was in danger, why didn't he have a cop at the door in the hospital. this and many more questions remain. too bad because the premise was there, just bad writing and execution.<br /><br />good cast is wasted here. decarlo goes from bad to good to bad? lancaster's character lacks development and dureya is just blah as the "bad guy".<br /><br />this could re-made with a cohesive story line and better writing. of course it would be much more violent with lots of gratuitous sex and everything. the editing would be jerky as well i guess, so let's leave well enough alone.
