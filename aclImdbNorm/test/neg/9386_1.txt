this show is terrible. i cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. this is not entertaining improvisational acting, it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene. i have actually done improv work as an actor, and this show is not improv.<br /><br />what the audience is actually laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show at all, it looks quite fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights. the dumb, completely unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at. and if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them that it's wrong! i find this show is disgrace to the art, and makes me cry for shows like whose line is it anyway, which had great talent, great improv games, and on top of everything else, didn't make me want to change the channel.
