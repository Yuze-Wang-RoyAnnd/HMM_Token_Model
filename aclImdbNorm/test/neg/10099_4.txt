enjoy the opening credits. they're the best thing about this second-rate but inoffensive time-killer which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove. the main part, however, goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who, nevertheless, occasionally manages to project a banty-rooster kind of belligerence. the first time we see him he's bare-chested, sweaty, and engaged in that favorite "beefcake" activity -- chopping wood. after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in "lethal weapon." he could use a better script, however, since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing. there's also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained. there are a few pluses, though. sending "john woodrow" undercover as "john wilson" is an amusing play on a presidential name, and co-star jody (ross) nolan shows promise as an inmate who, early in the proceedings, is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard. one final note: the movie's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras." despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to hold about 12 inmates! (note: the cast credits at the end aren't too helpful. for the record, the burly, bald-headed guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill fishback, and the young, fair-haired guard who administers electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc chenail.)
