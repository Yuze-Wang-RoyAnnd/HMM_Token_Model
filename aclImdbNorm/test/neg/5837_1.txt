i like science-fiction movies and even, low-rated, made for tv, bargain bin, movies i may still find interesting. well, i found this one in a bargain bin and brought it as a selection to a movie night with a group of friends.<br /><br />i was, literally, *emabrrassed* that i brought this movie.<br /><br />right from the beginning, the acting is bad, the story is bland and the plot is almost non-existent. all this leads right to what the movie really was: a soft core porno graphical movie.<br /><br />the movie started with a woman prison where the prisoners are all sexy women working in some sort of mine. first clue that this movie is not serious: attractive women in a prison being forced to do physical labor. yeah, right! whatever. :p once the "plot" continued, it was overshadowed by pointless scenes of people having sex. halfway through the movie, my friends and i stopped watching, it was so stupid. the next day, i thought that i would give the movie another chance and watch the rest. i watched about another 15 minutes and gave up again.<br /><br />if you are looking for a decent, science-fiction or even a sci-fi monster movie do not watch lethal target! if you want to see a low-budget, soft core porn that is light on plot, then see lethal target.
