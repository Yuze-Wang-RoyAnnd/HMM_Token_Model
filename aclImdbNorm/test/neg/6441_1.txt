eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now. it's such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings.<br /><br />the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat. the first two out (regardless of their sex) will sleep with each other, the 3rd & 4th out will have a fight in the vic, the 5th one will be arrested, the 6th develop an addiction, 7th get pregnant etc etc.<br /><br />the producers are clever though. the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines.<br /><br />1) someone will walk in the vic & say "what's goin on?" 2) someone else will stand up say "leave it aht" (out) 3) then a woman will say "doan choo come in ere 'n' insult mah fam'ly"<br /><br />that's it. that's every show. apart from the occasional "get it sort-id / is it sort-id?"<br /><br />the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk & their way of life. the buffers came off when 1) they extended it from two nights a week & 2) the slater family turned up. how they attract viewers is beyond me. the kat character symbolizes everything that's gone wrong with society, treating anyone else like something she's pulled off the bottom of her shoe.<br /><br />the people who vote her the best character, in these polls, must the same as the ones that vote jamie redknapp 'best sportsman' despite the fact he hasn't played a game for 3 years.<br /><br />what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave? ross kemp, martin kemp, the list is endless.<br /><br />how long has the longest couple's marriage lasted, with them being faithful to each other? yes, people leave, but until the script writers realise that characters, couple can be interesting & likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate. an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that. and zoe & the doctor top even lofty & 'shell' as 'most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv.'<br /><br />yes, eastenders is the most watched show, thats undisputed. but many external factors contribute to that. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures, it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours, and more than that, millions of the viewers watch it, out of nothing more than habit, but if they were completely honest to themselves, they would admit that (in 2002, more than ever), it can be absolutely pitiful.
