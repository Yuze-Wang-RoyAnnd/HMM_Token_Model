this was an 1970s-type irreverent comedy, poking fun at the psychiatric profession and at beverly hills. i didn't mind that but i did object to more that irreverence regarding marriage and religion: two topics which secular filmmakers (meaning about everyone in hollywood and elsewhere) just can't stop trashing. <br /><br />walter matthau plays a scuzzy character, "donald becker," who walks around with a cleric's collar on, which offends me but when has hollywood ever been worried about offending christians?<br /><br />anyway, despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it. dan aykroyd is good at paying a nut-case and donna dixon ("laura rollins") is a knockout. i am sorry she didn't have a bigger role.
