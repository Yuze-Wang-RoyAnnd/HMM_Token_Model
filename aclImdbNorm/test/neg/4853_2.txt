this game is from a genre of games that tried to capitalize off of the whole myst-inspired trend--walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. the puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible, but i'll stick to the acting itself, which is only slightly better. if you're looking for a convincing performance from any one character, you won't find it here, but this game is worth buying if only to witness the truly hilarious performance of christopher walken. his acting is so horrible in this game that it seems like he's imitating someone who happens to be impersonating him. he's a caricature of himself.<br /><br />so buy this game if you're masochistic, a walken fan, or simply want to hear the f-word a lot.
