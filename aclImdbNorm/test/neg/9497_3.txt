i love ustinov's distinctive, literate narration. and the photography is quiet nice. we put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. so for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed. when we re-watched, sitting down for family time,we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into. about halfway through the movie, there's a rack of dead, bloody furry animals. lots of blood, not just a little. then at the end, there's a wild struggle with a dog, then blood clouds the water. you'd think, given the g rating, that's all you'll see...that they will imply one of the animals died. nope. they drag the carcass out of the water and show it plainly for several traumatizing seconds. personally, as an adult i love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala scorsese, cronenberg, tarantino. heck, i love the ultra violent battle royale. but those aren't kid movies and don't advertise themselves as such. if you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals, then this is the movie for you. if you are like me and my wife though, you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one.
