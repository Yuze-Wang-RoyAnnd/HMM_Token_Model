although i am sure the idea looked good on paper, and it appealed to me when i first heard of it, this movie often lumbers along and falls flat, and when i watch it, i just want it to end. the bookend beginning and ending of the film about lou having to babysit a troublemaker is contrived at best, although i found the tall cop part to be humorous. however, i found little to laugh at with the bottom of the barrel script that was thrown together for these two great comedians. i thought that it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it reeks of "wizard of oz" rip-off (with the songs and black and white to color format). i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but die-hard a&c fanatics. anyone else will be disappointed, and they have many better films.
