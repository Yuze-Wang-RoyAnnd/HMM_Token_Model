this is the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i've sen a lot of bad movies. i love cheeesy horror but this was just terrible. there was not one scene in this film where i felt scared. all the actors must have been people that they found at a bus stop 20 minutes prior to shooting. i wish that blockbutser would have given me my 99 cents back. the acting was terrible. the writing was incredibly bad. someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know that it was terrible. i'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this monstrosity. don't rent this movie. if you do, don't return it so no other poor souls will ever make the mistake of renting it.
