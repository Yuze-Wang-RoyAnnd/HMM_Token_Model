i'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice. the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. the script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why vidal tried to disown it). the direction is worse. most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the "uncut" version). the cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. the movie should've looked a whole lot better. the overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an x-rated movie (guccione called it "paganography") wears thin after the first hour after peter o'toole and john guilgud exit. bob guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid-79's bbc production of i, claudius instead... and if you want porn, jeeze-louise, look somewhere else.
