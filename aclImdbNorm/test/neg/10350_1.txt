the original australian kath & kim is brilliant. why do american producers need to remake & ruin yet another classic show? remember the original version of "the office" with ricky gervais, it was an absolute masterpiece, and there was no need to remake it. the producers said that the british humour from "the office" and the australian humour from "kath & kim" would not translate to an american audience......... what??? so basically they are saying that americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes, so they need to remake the shows with over-the-top childish gags, so that the americans can understand the humour. the original australian version of kath & kim is fantastic and very funny. avoid the american version like the plague!!
