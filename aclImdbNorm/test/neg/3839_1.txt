a blind person could have shot this movie better...seriously! the director is clearly a novice. he must be dennis hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie. i felt so embarrassed for dennis.<br /><br />to john, the director...please retire from directing. your contribution is not needed nor wanted. the medium of film is stronger without you. you are terrible at directing. stick to bagging groceries or something.<br /><br />this movie should've bypassed "straight to video" and gone "striaght to the trashcan." i'm a dumber person for having seen this movie. do not see this movie if you respect yourself and respect the artform of film!
