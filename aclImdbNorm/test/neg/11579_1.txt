****spoiler alert**** my boyfriend, some friends, and i rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. we sort of knew what we were getting into. but the lack of plot, direction, and special effects actually left us hoping for a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (that ate people like scooping ice cream)... we sort of get this in the end, but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints? its one redeeming quality is that its laughably bad, with many salient details pointed out by other readers. i recommend this movie if your into cutting onions to make yourself cry.
