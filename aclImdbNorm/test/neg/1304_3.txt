the digital effects were done on the cheap and the action sequences lack suspense. this was essentially made for tv and it shows. david suchet looks bored and nigel planer looks down right embarrassed! and as for robert carlyle's dick van dyke london accent, no comment! if you want to pass away an hour or two when you've nothing on then it will do. if your going to buy the dvd wait a few weeks and pick it up in the bargain bin at asda, cos thats where its heading! if the budget was bigger and richard doyle's book followed more closely, then it could have been something special, but as it stands its a bit poor. watch the trailer instead! or read the book and see what could have been.
