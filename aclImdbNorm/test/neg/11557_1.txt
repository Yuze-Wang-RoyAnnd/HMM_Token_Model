i think i can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had no robots in it. the guys in "robot" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole "plot" isn't a robot either.<br /><br />the whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere, with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set. i can't even use words to describe the acting...<br /><br />this couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of "star crystal". in short, it is clearly one of the worst sci-fi movies of the 80's and i would be so bold as to say "of all time".
