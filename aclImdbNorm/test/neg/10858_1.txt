larry bishop, the writer/actor/director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. the actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film's start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. the hell with the ride. the film is a bomb.<br /><br />the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. they are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists. pistolero, played by larry bishop, is the revengeful leader of the pack. the gent (michael madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. <br /><br />comanche (eric balfour) is loyal, but mysterious. deuce, performed by david carradine, should have passed on the ride, and so should the ticket-buyers (if you decide to see the film, you'll be sorry, but you'll find out why). billy wings (vinnie jones) is a lewd and venomous character, completely filled with disdain.<br /><br />what puzzles me is how this film, with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity, ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere. ticket-buyers, take my advice: don't pay for the ride. please don't make the same mistake as the investors.<br /><br />the first fifteen minutes, or so, of the movie is confusing and unintelligible. the dialog, which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues, doesn't make any sense. the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere. poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. he, too, should have passed on the ride. there are decapitated heads, slashed throats, and nude females wrestling. it is clear that bishop doesn't know where he is going with the film. he gets entirely lost. but, by the end of the ride, you just won't give a damn. mama mia! stay home. and, by all means, don't take the ride. i rate this film a 1 out of 10, but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero.
