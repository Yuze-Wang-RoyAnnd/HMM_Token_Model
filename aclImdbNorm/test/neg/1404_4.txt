this was a character's movie. the plot wasn't that hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well-acted. the story focuses on the travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide. i say that loosely, because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too, they edited the movie pretty poorly. the acting on all parts was very good, particularly emile hirsch as the surviving, confused son. the characters were all very interesting and i didn't mind watching them until late in the film, when it just seemed to drag. <br /><br />my big complaint, however, was the story. the son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot. however, it really wasn't. it was something that happened at the start of the story, but then everything went every which way. then they'd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread. the other thing was that the big plot twists, of which there were plenty, were never really explained or built up to, but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field. in fairness, the ending was very, very cool. but it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (the half that wasn't padding) was pretty much lifted from the story in the pearl jam song alive. which reminds me... <br /><br />there was a "poem" in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed themself. i could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted, word for word, from that very same song. i dunno, this was a movie i had hope for, and they really, really dropped the ball.
