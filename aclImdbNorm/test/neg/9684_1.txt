how offensive! those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible. i can imagine those at nbc saying, "ok. let's make a movie to appease those pesky christians, but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order." well, they were wrong. anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. i only gave this movie a 1 because i couldn't give it a 0.
