this movie is one of the worst remakes i have ever seen in my life! the acting is laughable and corman has not improved his piranhas any since 1978. 90% of the special effects are lifted from piranha (1978), up from the depths (1979) and humanoids from the deep (1979). it makes piranha ii: the spawning look like it belongs on the american film institute list.
