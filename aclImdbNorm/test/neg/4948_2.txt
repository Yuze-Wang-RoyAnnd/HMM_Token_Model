this is a terrible film. angie dickenson is a class act and always does well, but she does not get many roles any more and she must have needed some money to do this film. by the way, she is on screen less than 10 minutes. oooh, wait, there is one redeeming feature in this film: meg foster has a small part in this film. now, meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly great but she has the scariest eyes of any actress i have ever seen. by name, you probably don't know her, but one look at her eyes and you will recognize her. to summarize: the acting is horrid, the story bad, and even the filmography is dreadful. a screen going to black every time the director wants to change scenes is pretty moronic. watch any thing else but this, even mr ed reruns!
