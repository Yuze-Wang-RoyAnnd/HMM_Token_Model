this series continues to frustrate and annoy. how are they going to drag this out for another year? each episode offers up more and more questions, whilst providing the answers to very few. to quote another very popular website, i believe that this show has now jumped the shark!<br /><br />will, i keep watching it?<br /><br />probably,<br /><br />will they manage to keep the show on-air till it ends?<br /><br />probably not...<br /><br />how did two qualified doctors fail to notice that naomi was still alive? how did 30 plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back? how did someone have enough strength to create two trails and climb up a tree to ambush kate?<br /><br />we've now introduced a ghostbuster...<br /><br />same time next week? yep!
