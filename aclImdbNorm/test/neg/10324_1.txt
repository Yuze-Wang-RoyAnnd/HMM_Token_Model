i walked into blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. so i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter sandra bullock. an action movie with sandra bullock in it and it's rated r!? yay! although i will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'speed' then i was sold. sadly sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: "panicky kidnapped girlfriend" (she is in fifth place on the actors listing for jeebus shakes!) apparently this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie, i figured as much) sandra is the only living human in this movie, everyone else might as well be a zombie in a b-horror flick. this movie deceived me saying sandra was the lead . . . i fell for it like biff from 'back to the future' when marty yells "what's that . . .!!!" god, i wish i watched that instead of this.<br /><br />sandra is the only bright side of this movie, every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock paddles and yelling "clear!" to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries. more on sandra later . . . <br /><br />the movie is dull. very dull. think of the dullest moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for 110 minutes (for me, it is this movie). this movie even somehow makes gun fights and bullet time effects boring, so boring that elephant tranquilizers are put to shame. and this movie's idea of bullet time is a close up of an ak in slow motion which mocks you as the caps spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly ticks away. and i knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast forwarding "through-the-action!" the plot? . . . there was a plot? music? . . . even by 80s muck standards is bad but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake. acting? sandra bullock was good and . . . ummm . . . moving on. is it any good since it is rated r? no, unless r stands for ridicules-snooze-fest.<br /><br />and it is really 80s clich'e when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city (rocking guitar licks or power ballet) and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes. both of which this movie satisfies. at least this movie establishes what era it's from which was unnecessary since sandra's hair was screaming "1980s!!!!" and a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box, which you respond to sadly saying: "that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got." another hammy moment is at the beginning when some-secret-agent-dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die. all that scene needed was the mario death ditty or maybe contra sound effects but nintendo might have sued.<br /><br />and it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other better movie icons. before the big gun scene, da hero is found standing in a boxing ring ('rocky' anyone?), sporting a leather fedora (not 'indiana jones' too) with an ominous spotlights behind him (terminator the 2nd before owning t-1000) what is really really sad is that people on youtube or dailymotion can film better quality videos (with a crappy webcam no less) then this movie. i'm serious, most rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie. i cannot even call this movie by it's given name for it's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a freaking violation against human rights!) the only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is sandra's career started taking off thanks to this movie. but oh sandra . . . why did you have to be in such a nightmare? the paycheck better been worth it. the dvd also graces you with a little back story on sandra as an extra, seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name. which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs, crafty little critter.<br /><br />i don't have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it. i could bounce back from 'mazes and monsters' with a good old campy bruce willis comedy. but not even bruce could cheer me up after this movie. i have yet to see any ed wood or uwe boll but i think i'm amped for them now. for i can't even fathom a movie worse then . . . "gag" . . . 'hangmen' . . .
