the beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. it was just one of those movies that i came across in my netflix instant queue and i thought it would be interesting to see brad renfro and bijou phillips team up together again since bully. unfortunately "interesting" never happened in this movie. swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (phillips). but swain likes one of the boys (renfro) from the "in crowd" and eventually starts hanging with them. and, of course, like all other movies things are good (or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good) and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids.<br /><br />the problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. it is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it, you feel you could have done anything better. some scenes (the ones with renfro's parents) don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it, at all.<br /><br />all the interesting things that could have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode (mischa barton and rachel bison from the oc). <br /><br />the only shining light in this movie, and the reason it doesn't get a one rating from me is phillips. they needed more scenes with her in it. renfro just look like he brought over a bit of his character from bully. and, for pete's sake, the title is bs, change the name.
