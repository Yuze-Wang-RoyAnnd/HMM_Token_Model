how does david lynch do it? unlike the legions of thick-black-framed-glasses-wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise his name, i just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such tripe. how can lynch sloppily cobble together leftover footage from a failed tv pilot into a nonsensical, poorly-acted mess & have critics rave about it & actually include it on year's best lists?<br /><br />i'm baffled. if you're looking for a good film noir, rent "bound" instead. if you're looking for a good "puzzle" movie try "memento." but beware of this over-hyped stinker unless your idea of a fun night is throwing away 2 1/2 hours of your life & $3.50 of your hard-earned cash.
