i have watched this movie quite bemused. i am not sure whether it was attempting to be a horror gore fest in a rob zombie type affair or an exploration of real events.<br /><br />in either case it missed its mark. it's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story. <br /><br />the performances were neither compelling nor bad.<br /><br />for me, i would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have gone down this route without spoiling the overall effect.
