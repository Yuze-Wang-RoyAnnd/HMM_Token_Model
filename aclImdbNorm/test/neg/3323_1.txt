why did they unleash this movie upon us? it seems as though they set out to make this movie a total slap in theface to anne rice and every self respecting vampire chronicles fan. it ignores the ground work laid down by interview with the vampire,mutilates the plot of the novel and has stuart townsend stumbling around drunk.<br /><br />stuart is not our lestat! our brat prince, our adventurous rebel with the damndest sense of humor. stuart is a second rate, boring rip off of dracula in black leather. he did not read the books or know the character...is he illiterate? tom cruise is dyslexic and still he made a point to read the books and know and love lestat.<br /><br />don't kid yourselves, it is not a "stand alone" vampire flick it's trash plain and simple.
