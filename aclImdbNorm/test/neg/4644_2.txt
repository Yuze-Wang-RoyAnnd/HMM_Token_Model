it is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie - this one is no exception.<br /><br />i am no lover of yanks but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white as well as make events (even fictional ones in novels) fit an agenda that bears little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme.<br /><br />wilbur smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than has been delivered by this awful mishmash of a movie.<br /><br />sad really for those who will never read smith. they will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his egyptian series, which has to be said is gigantic in its exposition.<br /><br />the indiana jones movies were snappy. to attempt to replicate that by manipulating smith's novels into this production misses out by a country mile.<br /><br />pathetic except for the photography and art malik.
