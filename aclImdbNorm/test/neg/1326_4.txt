do people rate this movie highly because it's a foreign war movie???<br /><br />to me it's nothing more than a bad hollywood war movie in german.<br /><br />this movie is so bad on so many levels. to even mention it along with platoon or full metal jacket is absurd. the battle sequences are pathetic, the dialog and acting atrocious.<br /><br />this so called group of "storm troopers" are regulars in the wermacht. not ss troops. there is so much wrong with this movie it's sad. bad editing, bad acting. it's got it all.<br /><br />the movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did.<br /><br />i read in a review that the this film had a $20 million budget.<br /><br />for real? where was it spent? in the fake train car sequences? in the pathetic "special effects"? ugh.<br /><br />as a wwii history buff, and wwii movie fan, i found this movie to be a serious disappointment.<br /><br />for an excellent alternative war movie check out "the beast". (not a wwii movie, but still outstanding)<br /><br />don't bother with this one.
