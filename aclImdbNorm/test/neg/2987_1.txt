no idea how this is rated as high as it is (5.8 at the time of writing) but this movie was absolutely horrible. the acting wasn't entirely bad but it really had no point whatsoever and the overall quality was poor. its obviously a b movie (or a c if such a thing exists) and it looks like it was made over a weekend at a friends house or something. im all for low budget movies and i generally watch any i come across but this one is really really bad. i mean like "the fanglys" bad. i don't know what else to say but trust in this as i have indeed sat thru this horrible horrible movie and i can save you the effort... don't bother. seriously... just don't.
