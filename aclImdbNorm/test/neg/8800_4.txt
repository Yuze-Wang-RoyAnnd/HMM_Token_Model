"the man from utah" opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback. this is how we're introduced to john weston (john wayne), heading into town and looking for work. when he helps marshal higgins (george pre-gabby hayes) foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting, the marshal offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the dalton valley rodeo. apparently, the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are a tight knit band of bad boys in the employ of spike barton (ed peil), who also happens to head up the rodeo committee. serious challengers to the supremacy of barton's top henchman cheyenne kent (yakima canutt) wind up severely ill or dead. <br /><br />even back in these 1930's lone star westerns john wayne had a charismatic presence that hinted at future star quality. if for nothing else, seeing wayne so young in these films is a real treat. the movie itself clips along at a quick fifty three minute pace, much of it taken up by stock rodeo footage of roping, bulldogging and indian parade and dance. in the deciding rodeo event, weston avoids disaster by discovering a poisoned needle inserted into the saddle of "dynamite", a formerly unridden bronco on which he must outlast cheyenne. <br /><br />the ending is no surprise, as barton's bad boys forsake winning the rodeo events and go for the whole thirty thousand dollar pot of prize money deposited in the local bank. but the marshal and weston are there to foil their plans and save the day for the dalton valley rodeo. and as we've seen before in films like "neath the arizona skies" and "randy rides alone", wayne's character closes out the film in a clinch with a pretty young lady, this time the judge's daughter marjorie carter (polly ann young), who pined for him throughout the film.
