three young college women, simona (iva krajnc), alja (tanja potocnik), and zana (pia zemljic), go on an adventure canoing down the river kolpa, dividing their slovenia from neighboring croatia, in this 2002 slovenian film by maya weiss. what could have been an eastern european version of the well-known and exciting 1972 "deliverance" turned out, for me, to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the characters.<br /><br />alja and zana are not convincing as students at all, though alja expresses a desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language. alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life. zana, even less scholarly, is a self-absorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women. i had some sympathy with relatively innocent simona, conservative and starry eyed. the very idea of these three traveling together just doesn't work for me. the disdain that zana and alja show toward simona makes no sense - why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes?<br /><br />the three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes, undeterred by a news story of a woman's disappearance along the river. things become more somber with the mysterious appearance, sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory, of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician (jonas znidarsic).<br /><br />i did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit. it may be because of a lack of cultural understanding, but the film didn't move me otherwise. i was surprised to see that the film has won some awards.
