there seems to be a whole sub genre of cheap, tired old sex "comedies" out there, that say the same old things about middle class couples. sort of like friends, but with more soft porn and no wit. this film is no exception- it had situations so familiar i died from deja vu. people sat on couches, spinning out clich'es about sex and relationships? check. monogamy versus cheating with some woman/man who would never look twice in reality at some other woman/man? check. porn the baddies!!!!111? check. some guy/girl in it who happens to be the only reason you're watching this rubbish? check. the lesson seems to be- when it doubt, make a tired old sex "comedy" about people no one cares anything about, in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand times before. that'll get your film made. it'll even attract some sitcom nobody in a bad wig!
