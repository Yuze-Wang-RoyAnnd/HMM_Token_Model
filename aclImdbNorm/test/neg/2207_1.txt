i would rather have someone cut out my eyeballs with a razor blade than have to watch this movie again. i watched it from start to end thinking it couldn't get any worse....but it did. the writers and producers should be slapped for putting this kind of crap on television. the actors are all terrible. get out of hollywood you fools and go work at mcdonalds sweeping the floors and emptying the trash. anyone that thinks this movie is even remotely decent should be hung. they are an embarrassment to humanity. to think we have soldiers putting their lives on the line for anyone that produces this kind of inane garbage. makes me embarrassed to say i'm an american.
