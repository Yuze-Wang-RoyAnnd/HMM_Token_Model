andr'e roussin was a specialist of what the french call "theatre de boulevard" : plays where you find the eternal triangle:man/wife/(male or female)lover .many of his plays gave elvire popesco some of her best parts on stage....and the great actress was the main reason to watch them,for roussin is not sacha guitry ,by a long shot.the french audience remembers "au theatre ce soir' .<br /><br />still with me? roussin's plays were not made to be filmed.and this one is pretty mediocre material ,even if the screenwriters call lewis carroll to their rescue .i like stewart granger and david niven ,and ava gardner is eye candy .but this might be their worst film ,being crude, predictable -even the native's (bola -bola )intervention is ludicrous- a knockabout farce around a menage `a trois on a desert island where granger would be some kind of robinson,niven ,his friday and gardner his girl friday.
