i must admit that this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i thought dennis hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of yeeeecchh. if this is supposed to be funny then i gotta look around for a new sense of humor. if you're thinking of buying this movie you'd better think again.
