i cannot believe anyone is giving this film a good rating. in addition to the terrible acting, thin (nonexistent?) plot line and slooooooooow pace, this would be the movie to watch if you were really trying to fall asleep. the writer's and director's brains must have been fried eggs to ever have concocted something as abominable as this. based on the plot summary on the dvd case, the premise really sounded promising. but within the first ten minutes i knew it was a lost cause. if you want to see a really creep take on the area 51 idea, check out the remake of "the hills have eyes". dreamland will soon fade away as all pathetic films of its ilk do. next!!!
