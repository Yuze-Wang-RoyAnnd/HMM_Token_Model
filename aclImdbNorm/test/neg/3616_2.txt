i really don't think it's necessary that i write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as "snake island", but even in the abstract confines of its own genre, this hit a new low, so my anger must be known. the only reason why i even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because i knew it was going to be bad, it was really late at night, i could not sleep, and in the past, really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber. it became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful, but it condescended below even those expectations.<br /><br />the movie was directed and written by wayne crawford, who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the african river, who ends up having to strand his team on a remote island called snake island until another boat comes down to pick them up. they hang out, get drunk, and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings.<br /><br />if your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't bother to reread it, you got it right the first time. frankly, i prefer my creature features when the creature(s) just attack the nonsensically dumb humans out of hunger, not because they have some kind of a mission. these aren't mutant snakes. they're not giants like what you see in "anaconda." they're just ordinary, everyday african snakes like mambas and vipers
