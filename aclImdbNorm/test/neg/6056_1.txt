i survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes, just to say i saw the end. if you want *real* mythology, flawlessly executed, look for armand assante's "the odyssey." great storytelling doesn't need to be tweaked - the stories are fantastic on their own. i only hope sean astin needed the money. and sophocles and ovid must be whirling in their graves - wherever those may be.<br /><br />at least with sorbo's version, the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library.i'm surprised halmi could turn out something so amusing (the tv series), and follow it with something so devoid of quality.
