jason connery is not an actor; he is the son of an actor. his macbeth is the worst i have ever seen. oh yes, he murders king duncan, but he also kills william shakespeare. his wife is even worse. please, give me polanski's version on dvd, so i can forget this monster. jon finch, orson welles, laurence olivier, there you have actors!
