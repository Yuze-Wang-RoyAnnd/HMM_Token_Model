i purchased this film on dvd for lb4, but it was a waste, the film is very bad. the plot is your average monster film, where it kills a few people, the mayor/chief doesn't believe it, and they fight it at the end.<br /><br />on the plus side, the film quality is very good, and the setting of new york is impressive for a budget film - as opposed to a small coastal town. the acting is reasonable too.<br /><br />however, the special effects, mainstage in a monster film, are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird. the ending is just bad.<br /><br />in summary, whenever you have a chance to see this, don't - there will be something better on.<br /><br />r-t-c "true horror films don't have a pg rating"
