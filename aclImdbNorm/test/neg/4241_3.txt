the female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking. they can also talk like there's no tomorrow. otherwise, this show would go into the toilet quickly. how much money do they make on all the people who text in, with that hope to be called back to win, $100.oo, or whatever. boy, now that's a scam!!! can i buy stocks in this money maker??? let's face it, with the technology of now, thousands of people could be calling every minute. and, with ten thousand channels and nothing worth a crap on, thousands of people watch this show. "oh, i know this answer!", is probably a super common line among the listeners. with these super hotties constantly saying the 'lounge' needs callers, i think it's a bunch of b.s. frequently, someone who does get through, sounds amazed that they're actually talking to the host. many of them sound depressed and worn out by probably waiting so long and trying so many times to get on and score some pocket change. wow, the producers must be just raking it in. no wonder there are so few commercials. commercials are only on to give time for more (primarily losers) to text in and wait, and hope, and dream, and fantasize about--- what? --- winning enough money for a tank of gas and a dinner at mc..something? i only watch it now & then on my brothers tv, because he likes to watch it when he's on the computer. i'll sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and look at mel (one of the tastiest looking women on tv) and laugh at the scam that's in front of me. then, i have to leave; even if i don't! people who have an active life, can only take this show in extreme moderation. mel, get yourself into the movies, or tv sitcoms, or something. many of us are infatuated with you! even with the super cu-ties, i'm amazed this show is still on!
