you just cant touch nrfptp! the new crop is just awful. the jokes are not funny. some of the troupe make me want to stop watching tv all together. lorne - you have let your creation go down the toilet. the guests sometimes are good, the bands are mostly garbage. weekend update, seth has to tell the audience when to laugh.....seth would get a proper reception in a baghdad cafe though...make sure andy goes with him... the show has about 10 jokes in all and they just keep rehashing them over and over. even the segments that are obviously not funny. offending people has become the name of the game, but they cant even do that right. just offensively. i am so disappointed with what has happened to the show, but now i also know it is safe to go out on a saturday night!
