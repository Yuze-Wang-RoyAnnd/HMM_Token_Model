what a despairing film. dress actors in furry rags, place in suburban wasteland, set cameras rolling and hope for the best. one can only imagine e the thanks the cast gave when their characters were killed off by sockpuppets, thus sparing them further humiliation in this dullfest. this rivals monster a go-go as the best cure for insomnia ever made. oh god - how can i fill up 10 lines explaining how overwhelmingly bored everybody looks in this movie? whiney crappy plastic bungling robot who annoys everybody both on and off screen, giant spider reduced to a single giant hairy leg pulled by string, actors desperately trying not to look at the camera while mumbling off dialogs...
