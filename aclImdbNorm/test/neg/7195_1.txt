this showed up on a dvd a buddy of mine bought for me. they had it listed as "the savage guns" which was an entirely different movie. obviously the folks who packaged the dvd never bothered to look at what they were burning on the disk.<br /><br />anyway, this movie is about as bad as they come. the sound track is a combination tv batman/early james bond/spaghetti western. lots of galloping around to this music. it appears that the guy has to gallop between scenes to burn up some time and give the sound track folks something to do.<br /><br />english is dubbed over the italian and it really shows. i wish it had been just a little bit worse and then it would have had some of the campy feel of the ed wood films. as it is, it is just plain awful.
