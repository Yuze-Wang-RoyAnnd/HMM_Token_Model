rourke does his usual bit part,as a sinister,rancorous,neanderthalian,ferocious,evil jerk,in the same mold as in "picture claire","out in fifty","get carter","double team" and the rest of the garbage he happens to be in.<br /><br />he has very few lines.<br /><br />of course,all this is just junk,undervaluing rourke,abasing him,and doesn't matter for his characterization as an actor.still ,after seeing "a prayer ...","johnny handsome","barfly","9 1/2 weeks","year of the dragon",etc.,etc.,for many years i considered rourke an outstanding,smart,intelligent man.i think he has changed since.<br /><br />he looks callous,calcined.<br /><br />"he went about with gloomy looks;/despair inhabited his breast/and made the man a perfect pest."(belloc,"the example").<br /><br />i had absolutely no other reason to watch this dull movie except that rourke was in.
