*spoilers herein* <br /><br />where do i begin with just how silly this movie was? 'mole sized people, living under the garden attacking residents of a big house'!!! when i first sat down to watch this movie i was unaware that the protagonists where not poltergeists etc but 10 inch high goblins that looked mighty easy to kick hard and far. i carried on watching it because i like to see movies through to the end even awful ones. this movie was terrible. my girlfriend, who went to sleep inside the first ten minutes, apart from finding it a good aid to sleep thought it was hilarious that i had bothered to watch it all.<br /><br />tiny goblins even in large numbers (the thought is silly i know) are about as scary and menacing as flat cola. they only managed to trip one guy up 'fatally' and kill a cat before they were blown up, the end. i did mention it sucked right?
