i let a friend talk me into viewing this movie, and all i can say is--i want to kill that friend.<br /><br />that is an hour and a half of my life i will never get back and i will forever regret it.<br /><br />if you've also had the bad luck of seeing this movie you will agree with me that this is absolutely the worst movie ever made, ever!<br /><br />if you've never seen this movie and are thinking of seeing it-- let me save you a waste of time and warn you: do not watch this movie, it sucks!!!!<br /><br />everything in this movie fails, the attempt at comedy and sexiness--it just comes off as stupid, trashy and disgusting. try having women in the movie who are actually attractive and sexy and not fat, ugly and gross to look at!!<br /><br />the acting is laughable as is the writing. obviously, this was made by total amateurs, i can't believe these people were allowed to make such a stupid movie, isn't there a law against that? there should be.<br /><br />there are a whole slew of good "b" movies if you are into that sort of thing, but do not waste you time on this crappy wanna-be movie.<br /><br />peace
