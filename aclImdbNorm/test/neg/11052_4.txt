fortunately, i haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. after watching the first 30 minutes, i became both disappointed and curious.<br /><br />disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - i still don't know why i had been shown the daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue. and also curious, to see what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the ending summary of all this brutality.<br /><br />unfortunately, though the movie was not boring, i didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that i had to watch from the beginning to the end. to my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is kill bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. afterwards i will take the ratings from the cannes film festival with more precaution, as while oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury, it had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale.<br /><br />i am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.
