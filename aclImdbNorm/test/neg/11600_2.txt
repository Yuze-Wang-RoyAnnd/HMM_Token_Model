first: a warning.<br /><br />i recently saw this movie on dvd in the universal 'hitchcock collection' series. the source print looks to be in immaculate condition, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video. the framing is far too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. even the title of the movie is cropped. i gather from other imdb reviews that there is a much better version available.<br /><br />mr and mrs smith is just a footnote to hitchcock's career.<br /><br />in his lengthy interviews with francois truffaut in the sixties, hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work, but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to carole lombard and that he didn't understand the characters so just photographed norman krasna's screenplay.<br /><br />in truth, there is not much more that needs to be said.<br /><br />it is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as it happened one night, his girl friday and philapdelphia story. carole lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of pretexts and spends most of the picture being 'adorably' unreasonable.<br /><br />robert montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband, but it is hard not to lose patience with him. long before the end of the movie the audience is saying: "dump the silly cow, she's not worth it."<br /><br />gene raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged. he is supposed to be a courtly, 'old family' southerner, although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene (which he otherwise plays very well). he is an honourable, generous, teetotal gentleman, so of course he is bullied and patronised by robert montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes - although he is not as badly treated as the similar ralph bellamy character in his girl friday.<br /><br />this movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation, but hadn't actually seen one. for example, a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of on-going comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap. here, all the comedy elements are just strung out, like beads on a necklace. this is screwball comedy by the numbers.<br /><br />it is the same with the direction. typically, these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end. hitchcock doesn't get this. his direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly over-written (but under-nourished) and slightly too long. he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it. they do ok.<br /><br />hitchcock had a good sense of humour, which he frequently used in his thrillers, but he had no feel for comedy as a genre. his later trouble with harry was also a misfire, for similar reasons to this movie, but at least he was involved in that picture. here he is just going through the motions.<br /><br />all the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad. it just feels a bit derivative, over-familiar, over-long and ultimately rather flat.<br /><br />mr and mrs smith is one for carole lombard fans and hitchcock completists only.
