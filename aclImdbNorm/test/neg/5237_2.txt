christophe lambert once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money. when i see his latest releases, i can believe that.<br /><br />beowulf is, all in all, in the "good" part of the crap movies : there are some good thrill scenes, indeed. the actors themselves aren't too bad. but the plot is silly, the "mortal kombat"-like music has nothing to do here, the ending is really s****y...<br /><br />really, the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was. i even wish i wasted my money on something else.<br /><br />
