i couldn't help but laugh when i saw what the public could be made to think was email back in 1996. apparently email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with lame voice synthesis reading every comment out loud. and some of the other "tech" aspects are also laugh-out-loud funny. i'd swear the "high tech" communications centre she has actually has a few commodore 64 monitors in it. almost like watching the movie hackers nowadays, i guess.<br /><br />despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow i can't ignore. i mean, why include something so stupid? <br /><br />anyway, to sum up: the plot is pretty predictable, the acting bad, the killer quite guessable. but it can be amusing in a mystery science theatre 3000 kind of way i guess.
