i watched this video because i like malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. the movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. you had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. it had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.<br /><br />in short, i'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again. it was so bad, i actually couldn't fall asleep. there are quite a few "eurotrash" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. this is one of them. on the bright side, who is nadia cassini? never before have i seen a more beautiful set of legs. she is the one saving grace of this movie.<br /><br />disturbing, too, was the cruel boar hunt depicted in the closing credits. a boar that was released on someone's property (malta has very few native mammals; all of them small - rats, bats, etc.) and then set upon by dogs before it was shot. oh, well - go visit malta anyway despite this film - it's a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.
