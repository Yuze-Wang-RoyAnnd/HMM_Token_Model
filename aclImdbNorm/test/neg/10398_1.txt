this demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the eighth circle, tenth bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. sandow birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.<br /><br />stocking hell with republican political figures, fox news helicopters and christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. it is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite. nothing in birk's unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite his smug pretension to the contrary. <br /><br />i could have eaten a reel of video tape and puked a better movie. i regret the two hours of my life that i lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry. calliope will weep forever.
