utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process. while it is true that the sat's is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college, what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewing.<br /><br />college admissions officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process. the film is an insult to hard-working high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have applied for. <br /><br />this movie certainly deserves rejection on all levels.
