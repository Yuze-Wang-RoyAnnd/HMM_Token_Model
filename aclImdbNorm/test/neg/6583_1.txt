much like final fantasy, if you look at a still shot - it doesn't look so bad. but when the people start moving, it's utterly horrifying. uneven jerky motions, frightening lack of emotion, and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps. the characters do not even appear alive/organic.<br /><br />i saw a preview screening with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! she was not at all engaged. for the record, i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixar-esque films as well as a number of the 'bad' 2d films like sinbad.<br /><br />the lighting is painful, giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. the lip syncing is bad - worse actually than final fantasy. <br /><br />i also seriously question having hanks play five characters.... this was a major distraction throughout the film. the role of the conductor is eerie - although in a way i just can't pinpoint. it reminds me of my father's fake "phone" voice when greeting clients.<br /><br />i think this is why the multiple roles are distracting - you are accutely aware that the voice is the same, but yet distinctly different. it gives each character the feel of being acted, as opposed to being real human characters. the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks. i've seen the technique work - a la eddie murphy, but hanks just can't come close to pulling it off with a voice alone, given the horrifying animation.<br /><br />i would not waste my money on this - wait for the rental.
