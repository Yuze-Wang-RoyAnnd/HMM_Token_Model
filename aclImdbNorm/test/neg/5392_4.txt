dear scifi channel: how have you been? how was your summer? i've been ok, but i feel like our relationship isn't the same anymore and we're growing apart. i don't understand why you don't love me anymore. i've just finished watching your scifi channel original "skeleton man" and, once again, you've shown a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by killing off every hot girl in this movie!!! i mean, i understand that you're just in this for instant gratification. all you care about is producing a movie where people get sliced and diced by a homicidal indian spirit/creature/legend/whatever. so you really don't have time to put some thought and effort into anything else -- like finding a costume for skeleton man that doesn't make him like the gay lover of skeletor from "he-man." seriously, his robe looks like a satin blanket sheet and his skull is smooth as a baby's behind, he almost looks like a killer halloween-costume-for-a-6-year-old as he marches through the wilderness on a homicidal rampage. so we throw you a bone, because we're not looking for oscar-winning performances, intriguing plot or realistic character reactions to the situations at hand. because we realize that even though michael rooker, caspar van diem and all the girls are supposed to be trained special ops agents, they are all mysteriously transformed into keystone kops who can't shoot or see straight whenever skeleton man appears. and we also fully expect that nothing -- bullets, explosions, electrocution, nothing -- can kill skeleton man until there is one minute left in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up neatly. we expect to see blood and guts. but you have a knack for taking the least attractive actress in the entire cast and making her the only female who survives. and quite honestly, i think you do it just to antagonize me. because this movie, as silly as it is, has the potential to be a "so-bad-it's-good" classic and just killing off all the hotties ruins everything -- and forces me to lower its rating. all i ask is that once, just once, you take my feelings into account and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. please.
