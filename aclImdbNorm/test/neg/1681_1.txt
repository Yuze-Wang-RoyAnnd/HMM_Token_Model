dull one-note characters with next to no development, unimpressive performances by people who sound like they're simply reading lines, and ludicrous special effects combine to make this a genuine stinker. the story begins with eminently bland commando russo and his fellow soldiers attacking an al-qaeda training base. the scene tells us that al-qaeda has recently come to seek an ultimate weapon, and also serves to illustrate russo's only character trait, a tendency to eschew teamwork. with the help of a collection of blank slates and walking stereotypes, including a russian spy, russo travels to chechnyan territory to catch a mad scientist working for the terrorists. along the way, they encounter vast hordes of flesh-eating bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason. from there, the movie becomes nothing more than a dragging morass of ridiculous action, including a scene in which a swarm of bats slices a soldier's arm off!
