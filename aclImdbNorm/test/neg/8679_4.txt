this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. henry may long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced merchant ivory-type features. <br /><br />i suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'brokeback mountain.' it features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life, but it is truly a dark and depressing film.
