a great gangster flick, with brilliant performances by well-known actors with great action scenes? well, not this one.<br /><br />it's rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well-known actors, that have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie, without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in.<br /><br />first of all, the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fancy in it. the way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is (when i thought the two hours should be almost over, i was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed).<br /><br />the action scenes look a lot like those from 80ies tv series - the a-team, for example. it's just that in the 80ies (esp. with the a-team) those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in "el padrino". it's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something (not to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through).<br /><br />the acting fits quite nicely to the action. either you get the same reaction to everything that happens (dolph lundgren style), or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody (but unfortunately it's not).<br /><br />my advise is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.
