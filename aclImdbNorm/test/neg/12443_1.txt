my mom brought me this movie on a dvd. a guy in a rental recommended it. but in fact, this might be the worst movie i've ever seen. you know, i didn't expect much from this film, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was senseless. i was looking forward to see christine lakin in this movie because i loved step by step. even she was a huge disappointment. the story was completely unreal. one of the party guys is dead (he wasn't dead in fact, he woke up later), the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. but then there comes a homosexual, policeman... there is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes??? come on, just be realistic at least. waste of money. really...
