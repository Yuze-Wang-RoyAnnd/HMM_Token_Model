the opening scene really got me into watching the movie. however, not more than 5 minutes later, i was already gouging my eyes out. not only could i not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. the one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. however, i didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two african americans. but i guess anything is possible. also, why the hell was robin in the movie? i'm not sure that it added anything artistically. overall, i would strongly recommend you jump off a cliff before you rent this movie.
