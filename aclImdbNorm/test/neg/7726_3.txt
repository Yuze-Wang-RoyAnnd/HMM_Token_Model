i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that. the first one i saw, bloodrayne, was not a complete loss. i liked it more than most people, and actually rated it a 4 out of 10. next up was the first house of the dead movie. now that was horrifically bad. i could stand watching ten minutes of it, and fast-forwarding a bit, and that was it. i could see where it was going and i didn't need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10.<br /><br />but i had access to the sequel, too (which however is not by uwe boll, but, mysteriously, written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first one), and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original, i thought i'd give it a chance. and i actually managed to watch all of it. it started out with some funny references and cool lines (like how the president got his orders from the vice-president!), and acting-wise it is light-years better than the first. here we have cool muchachas like the ultra-hot emmanuelle vaugier, whose coolness is in league with carrie-anne moss, claudia black and evangeline lilly. man, i hope some matrix-style movie comes along for her sometime. and the always delectable, super-aerobicized victoria pratt. i love athletic women. and, there was also nadine velazquez (catalina on "my name is earl"), who performed quite well.<br /><br />the story wasn't much, and the action wasn't great, either, and the ending was a disappointment, as they didn't succeed in their mission. oh well, at least the two mains survived. guess that's some small victory, too.<br /><br />good cast, but a pretty bad movie. the actors make it watchable, but there's no real substance there.<br /><br />3 out of 10.
