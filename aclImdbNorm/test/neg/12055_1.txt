but i can't say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung. where to begin. the film quality, there isn't any. i've seen clearer pictures on america's funniest home videos! the acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. the clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. the same thing over and over again. at least in a friday the 13th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part. there is no main characters, just victims. man, now we come to the worst part of all. the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends. then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room. what kind of ending do you call that, crap, that's what. in my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, that was just sloppy writing. the excuse, "it has to ending badly, it's a horror movie." or "we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel" are just lame excuses and that is all. i must give the camp blood the thanksgiving turkey.
