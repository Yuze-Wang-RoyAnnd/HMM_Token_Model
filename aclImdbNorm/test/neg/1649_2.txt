perfect double bill for the horribly corny "beverly hillbillies" is this equally atrocious, lame brained 'comedy', "son in law". country girl rebecca goes to wild california to attend college, only to be assaulted by the lifestyle. 'resident adviser' "crawl" helps her settle in, and soon the two are good friends. bec decides to bring the wacky "crawl" home for thanksgiving, with obvious "fish out of water" results.<br /><br />the only other comic angle steve rash (aptly named ) achieves here is a sexual one. this he bludgeons us with, but to no avail. both comic aspects fail dismally, and you know the film is groping when "crawl" hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn field.<br /><br />dramatically the movie falls short too, with several attempts at family and personal counselling from "crawl" misfiring. between them pauly shore and carla gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are mere fodder. the problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like "crawl", and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why rebecca would want to spend a moment with him. however, if you're a fan of unintelligent comedy, "son in law" is right on the mark.<br /><br />sunday, november 10, 1996 - t.v.
