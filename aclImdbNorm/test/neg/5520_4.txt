oddly enough, it's fred macmurray who plays the more "screwy" part in this screwball comedy. carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness.<br /><br />as usual, fred macmurray remains a mystery to me. the camera is no fan of his, he's not that attractive, and he doesn't have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grant-like role.<br /><br />ralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombard's character. one can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle, reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurray's ineptness. but that's hollywood!<br /><br />the picture almost works but misses the mark, primarily due to macmurray's performance. it would've been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role. lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable; macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length.
