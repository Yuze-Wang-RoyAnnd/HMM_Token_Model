writer-director patrice leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite a-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. it's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. "teach me how to be likable", art dealer francois coste (daniel auteuil) tells a random stranger (dany boon), and that about sums it up. we learn next to nothing about friendship, and daniel auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. just as we hope the travesty is over, leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. like francois's treasured greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. leconte's only asset is julie gayet in the part of coste's business partner catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut.
