maximum risk is quite surprising to a person that has seen more then on of his movies. director ringo lam made an average action-movie, that can be compared with most of the other mid-quality action movies, what is a special predicate to a `muscles from brussels`movie. it has a quite classy style, an interesting atmosphere and, last but not least, the beautyful natasha henstridge. even vandamme doesn't make you crying by his acting, he does a relatively good job. of course you may not compare maximum risk (oh, what a creative title!) to `ronin`, but after watching `knock off` it's the hell of a good movie... in special standards, of course.
