i didn't think this movie was very good at all. basically they took a bunch of one-liners from various shirley temple movies, threw them together, and had orr act like shirley temple acted on-screen. "oh my goodness!" was said quite a number of times. if you are familiar with shirley temple movies, you will recognize several lines direct from her movies. the trouble is they have orr saying these in shirley's everyday life. in the end, what we get is a hodgepodge of re-created shirley temple movies, instead of any sort of real look into shirley temple's life. save yourself the trouble and rent shirley temple movies, it's a lot better than watching orr try and recreate shirley's acting style.
