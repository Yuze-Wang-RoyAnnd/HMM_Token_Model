this is another sci-fi channel original movie staring rhys davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (john sheppherd helms all three.)basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. clich'ed sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn't believe a monster story.)no dramatic helicopter drop of the navy seals here. budget only allowed for entire force force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ships wench aboard. puleeze. also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer. i also loved when the seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten miles away was able to see three people jump of the ship. if the sci-fi channel is going to continue original movies i hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better scripts and directors. if this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 cent bin.
