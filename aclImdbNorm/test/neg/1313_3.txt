'flood' is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script. the basic premise is fine: what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the thames flood barriers and engulf london so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time? it's basically the new york segment of 'the day after tomorrow', but that shouldn't make it any less of a film. however, the script just isn't there. it's merely functional, flat, and lacking in depth. great british talents like robert carlysle and david suchet to name but two do their level best with what they've got, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like something out of an old marvel comic. and it'd be frankly easier to turn back the tide. not that every actor gets let off the hook - tom courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film, but then he wasn't given much of a challenge.<br /><br />i applaud any opportunity to see some non-hollywood disaster flicks for a change, and i don't expect zillions of dollars spent on rendering ultra- realistic graphics. however there's no excuse for shonky writing - especially from a country that has produced some of the best science- fiction ever made on next to no budget at all. this is the kind of half- hearted b-grade fluff the sci-fi channel produces, and that's hardly a target to aim for. if like me you are such a fan of disaster films you're still tempted, do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends. better still; don't bother.
