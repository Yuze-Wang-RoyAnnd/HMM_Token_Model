awful in a whole new way, anything but love probably should be seen by movie buffs--if only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a "vanity" production. i am guessing a vanity production, since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent-free and not particularly attractive non-singer/actress as isabel gold in the leading lady role--vied for yet by the likes of "lookers" like cameron bancroft and andrew mccarthy--except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie. her singing leaves much to be desired, and yet, unbelievable as it is, all the other characters in the film think she's terrific. there are a few moments here of actual charm or humor, but very few. otherwise this is a silly, sad fiasco that veers from paint-by-numbers to paint-by-wrong-numbers. you know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says, "my kid could do better than that!" well, this is a movie, the likes of which your--or anyone's--kid might do better.
