the photography is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is bad. the various scenes are cut, or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are s-l-o-w and tedious. this slowness continues the entire show. it is a very tedious show to watch. . . . i believe that more scenes should have been added, but that would make it a longer show. it is very slow-moving. the writers should have made it just a 1-night show, and not prolong our agony night after night. there is nothing else on, otherwise i'd change the channel (the first night). i feel bad for the indians of the time, and am angry at the white-men for what they did to the indians, but thats our history.
