dreadful! a friend of mine (who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour) recommended this.<br /><br />it's bobbins. i almost switched it off. it is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so.<br /><br />this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business. i struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie. less funny than global warming.<br /><br />i'm not normally so vehement, but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive.<br /><br />puerile, plot less, useless tosh.<br /><br />i'd rather eat my feet than watch it again.
