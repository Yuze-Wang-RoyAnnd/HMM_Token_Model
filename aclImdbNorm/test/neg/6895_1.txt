around 1980, the name godfrey ho was attached to a series of low-comedy action films starring an actor with the unlikely name elton chong". although no masterworks of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for silliness.<br /><br />it is altogether unclear why ho (or whomever) would want to make a film that would attack jackie chan's drunken master, the film that legitimated the making of comedy-action films in hong kong. but that's what this is, a savage attack on the chan film (the imitation chan who stars in this movie learns to cause his opponents to laugh themselves to death - a pointless gimmick in any genre).<br /><br />along with all the flaws one expects from a godfrey ho film of this period - no continuity, no motivation, incomprehensible plot line, irrelevant and unbelievable characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable faults that effectively make it unwatchable: the fight scenes stink, and the comedy isn't funny.<br /><br />pointless.
