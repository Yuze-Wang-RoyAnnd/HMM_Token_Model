star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />old detroit is back, with the giant omni consumer corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new delta city continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of cain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of christ-likeness, peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke. as he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him, the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal. with robocop out of action, a ruthless ocp business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping, snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which cain fits perfectly. after a brief glitch in his system, robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with cain.<br /><br />the original robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those films that just can't be done again. that said, it's not surprising a sequel was made- it's even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original. empire strikes back director irvin kirschner has crafted an unpleasant, slightly incoherent and overlong film that can't capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard it tries. and it certainly does that, the funny ads from the first film running none stop, the corporate satire aiming to be that bit sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before, but with blood/gore even meaner than the first film. the first film earned a name for some nasty, blood-soaked violence (including a man's genitals being blown off and a man being blasted to pieces) but while that was more memorable the violence/gore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature, with a very unpleasant and mean-spirited tone to it.<br /><br />but overall, the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy- why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead? **
