one of the many silent comedies stan laurel featured in before he teamed with oliver hardy, 'mud and sand' is a ho-hum hokum. the story is badly disjointed - though this could be because of the modern-day edit - and the humor itself is not at all inventive.<br /><br />potential plotlines are started and ignored; for instance, stan's promise to make fillet de sole pay for what she's done to him never comes to fruition. stan's character doesn't seem very centered, either, but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed 'stanley' of laurel & hardy fame, so it might be that i was just expecting to see this shortcoming.<br /><br />i strongly believe that all the silent films should be preserved and viewed, and i'm glad this one is still available. it's just not a great film.
