one of bolls better attempts. just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. the main difference between bloodrayne and farcry really is that the story from farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas bloodrayne had a strong story and thus boll had more chance to mess it up.<br /><br />the action in this movie is actually fairly good. occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.<br /><br />acting wise it was pretty decent. most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.<br /><br />while i think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. especially given the plot of the game was hardly oscar winning just a vehicle for fps carnage. would have liked it set in the jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but canada doesn't have a great deal of jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.<br /><br />why boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots i don't know but he does. and until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.
