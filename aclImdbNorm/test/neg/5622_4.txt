another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying "pulp fiction."<br /><br />if you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half, this'll probably fit the bill. fans of the debut episode of "aeon flux," wherein the title character slays literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers single-handedly, will really go for it.<br /><br />otherwise, it's not exactly a clever movie. in fact, all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. sometimes an entire scene goes by, and the only thing that happens is, you guessed it! someone gets shot. or, to spice things up, twenty people get shot. first, they're just sitting there, the next minute, they're sitting there dead. yahoo!<br /><br />rough plot: a young american goes to paris (an american in paris, get it?), hires a prostitute (the ethereal julie delpy), gets in touch with some old french buddies, one of which has aids, they plan and attempt a bank heist. of course, movie convention states that no bank robberies on film go off w/o a hitch, and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the running time (it's like "dog day afternoon" without the sidney lumet's wit, patience, or humanity). while at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), and the parisian with aids, goes wacko with his uzi several hundred times. no spoilers here, but suffice to say that you're at such an emotional distance from these characters that it's not likely you'll care who lives and who dies by the end of the film.<br /><br />some have called it stylish. perhaps it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's already been done, and "killing zoe" is trapped by convention. nowhere in the course of the movie does the director (roger avary, co-winner of the "pulp fiction" screenplay oscar) do anything really original, stylish, funky, or outrageous. unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count, there isn't anything else to set this one apart from the multitude.
