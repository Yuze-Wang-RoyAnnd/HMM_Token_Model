this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling, moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts. it just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />but it's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral. a vaguely plausible plotline (and that's being generous)becomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzarre events are never explained.<br /><br />this wouldn't be quite so bad if the scripting wasn't so cheesy, the acting so wooden (despite a strong british cast) and the direction so uninspiring. this is not an example of good british film making nor indeed should it make tarantino bat an eyelid, at least not in comparison to his earlier work.<br /><br />my advice in this case, if it's hard to get hold of, don't waste the effort. if you're a brit like me and it's in your local video shop, steer well clear. perhaps head to the video entitled "american beauty" - now that's an example of great british direction.
