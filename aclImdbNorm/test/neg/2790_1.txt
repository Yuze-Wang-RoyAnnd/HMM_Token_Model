the first opening scene that lasted around five minutes showed the potential of becoming an instant classic, with moderit to good acting, good film, a story that keep the volume up, and an in the corner the of screen a spooky "did you see that!"(the scarecrow moves).<br /><br />after the quick set up of history that would come into the present, it was like someone else had written and directed the rest of the "film". the next scene is a basic outline of how the film goes downhill like a runaway truck. it looks like the rest was shot in video, with crappy "porn style actors", the set design was a lawyers office with practically nothing on the bookshelves or anything in the office at all. <br /><br />i remember only watching crap horror films for a chance of seeing some naked "teenage" girls, back then there weren't victoria's secret mags everywhere, and not watching for things that make great horror films of today like acting, terror, suspense, intregue, and so on.<br /><br />it took nearly fifty minutes for the first person to die. when it did, me and and my friends were so shocked by the worst costume of a "monster" ever, we through our popcorn at the tv screen booing.
