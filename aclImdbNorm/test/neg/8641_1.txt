this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the, very protracted, end! <br /><br />the plot is confused and laboured, the actors have a couldn't care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they weren't going to get paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap.<br /><br />i fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then. more unrecoverable life time wasted!<br /><br />if you must watch it, then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once. but maybe you'll need an antidepressant instead!<br /><br />sometimes it's good if celluloid degrades.
