ok, last night i saw the world premiere of paul schrader's the exorcist: the beginning at the brussels international festival of fantasy films. with all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated.<br /><br />the director was there and so were most of the stars (except skarsgard).<br /><br />unfortunately the movie sucked big time. it was a real disappointment for me because i'm a huge fan of both shrader and friedkin's (rip) original 1973 film.<br /><br />what was wrong with it? most of it actually. the fx (you would think that the matrix and lotr digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!), the editing (no real pace or rhythm), the acting (only skarsgard at times could convince). the script was a, imo, set up to explain the african scenes in the original film. so the movie had the feel of a set up scene only it contributed nothing.<br /><br />the only thing that i did like was vittorio storaro's cinematography although i've seen better from him (apocalyps now).<br /><br />all of the time i was thinking this was just a rough cut, a work in progress. and that, given the (well known) circumstances, is probably what it is. but that doesn't change the obvious problems with the script.<br /><br />i had the chance to meet schrader (very briefly) but i didn't have the guts to tell him what i thought of the film and i was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote taxi driver for christ sake!!) that i forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his taxi driver script...
