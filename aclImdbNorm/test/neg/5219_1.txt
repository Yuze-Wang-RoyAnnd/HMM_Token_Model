ok, chuck norris has shown up in many an entertaining movie over the years. this is not one of them. i won't even bother trying to get into the plot about a bible shipment gone wrong. the "acting" of the main characters is so wood like, pinocchio would have done a better job! the synthesizer based soundtrack is even worse than the one in deathstalker. whereas traditionally low budget spooky movies are often trying to catch their audience by adding plenty of graphic violence, this one is trying to catch an audience by throwing religious mambo jumbo at the spectator. the plot boils down to different versions of the bible.
