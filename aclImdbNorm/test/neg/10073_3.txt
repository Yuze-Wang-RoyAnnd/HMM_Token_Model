how sad it is when a film as wonderful as "jurassic park" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. the newest sequel, jurassic park iii, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. the dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of cgi advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name. the introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make.<br /><br />go see "shrek" again.<br /><br />
