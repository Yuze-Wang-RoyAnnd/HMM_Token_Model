i liked the whole set up with ceasar's palace, the roman guards, and announcers in togas. this event also marked "the passing of the torch" as far as the voice of the wwf goes. gorilla monsoon who had done the play by play for every wwf ppv up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he's there to announce another ppv. but then introduces jim ross who is making his wwf debut and jr continues to do the wwf commentary to this day. but outside of that, this event is pure garbage. good ol scientific wrestling has been thrown out the window and enter the birth of gimmicks. this to me was the event that the wwf started to go down the toilet, and didn't recover until the attitude era of the late 90's. here's a review of the event.<br /><br />ic title match: tatanka (challenger) vs. shawn michaels (champ): an okay opener, but given what shawn is capable of, it was very disappointing. i have no idea why the wwf was hell bent on putting tatanka over. they should of realized that shawn was the future and tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in an indian gimick. the ending of the match itself was very lame. shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out, then gets called for a count out. while it was fun watching sherri get beat up afterwords, this match just was forgettable. shawn had to carry this match and had trouble doing it.<br /><br />the stenier brothers vs. the headshrinkers: steiners get the win via a franknsteiner. this match had it's moments, but the crowd just didn't seem into it. there was no heat behind it, i think it was a match just to throw two tag teams in.<br /><br />crush vs. doink the clown: terrible! terrible! terrible! this match completely sucked. two very lame gimmicks. a clown and a hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. the ending caught everybody by surprise. in the upcoming months, crush turned heel and doink turned face, but none of the fans seem to care. sadly, this was not the worst match on the card.<br /><br />razor ramon vs. bob backland: you got a brand new heel that is very over going against a wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago. the fans snicker and laugh when backlund comes out. and like hogan/rock in wm18 and hhh/owen in wm14, the heel wrestler gets louder cheers in the face. thankfully this match was short. the right guy won, but i wish they had razor totally beat the crap out of and squash backlund rather than winning by a small package out of nowhere.<br /><br />tag team champion match: ted dibiase and irs (champs) vs. hulk hogan & brutus beefcake w/jimmy hart i still would like to know the full story on what happened to hogan's eye. oh well. the crowd was really into this match, but it had no flow to it what so ever. hogan and beefcake were clearly suffering ring rust given that both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year. dibiase, being the great technical wrestler that he was, did help to carry the match from being a complete waste. the ending was a surprise with dibiase and irs getting the win via dq. but to please the crowd, hogan and beefcake did their usual playing to the crowd at the end like they had won the match.<br /><br />lex luger vs. mr. perfect: the best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied lex luger to the ring. other than that, this was completely forgettable. the mr. perfect gimmick was born for a heel role and he just lacked the heat as a face. and luger is just a waste of time no matter what gimmick he's in. luger wins via a backslide despite that perfect's feet were in the ropes. then perfect spends the post match getting his butt kicked. first luger knocks him out with the running elbow. then when perfect regains consciousness he goes back to the dressing room to find luger only to get the crap beaten out of him by shawn michaels, setting up an hbk/perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic but the wwf misused.<br /><br />the undertaker vs. giant gonzales: absolute crap!! what was the wwf thinking bringing in such a horrible wrestler as giant gonzales. sure he had size, but i'd rather watch the brooklyn brawler in a match than him. this isn't even worth commenting on.<br /><br />wwf championship match: bret hart (champ) vs. yokozuna (challenger) you have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time going against a guy who's only advantage is that he's a gigantic lard ass. bret was able to carry the match, but a rather predictable ending with mr. fuji throwing salt in bret's face.<br /><br />post match: yokozuna vs. hulk hogan pure crap right here. hogan comes down to the ring for no apparent reason and mr. fuji challenges him to a match after yoko just won the title. even the die-hard hulkamaniacs find this to be total bs.
