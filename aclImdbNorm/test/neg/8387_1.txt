i had the misfortune to see this film recently and have to sit through it. a friend purchased it for lb1 and insisted we watch it as it sounded good from the story on the back cover.<br /><br />10 minutes into the film it was apparent that the actors were amateurs and this was an extremely low budget effort.<br /><br />the scenes were very poorly acted, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes which seemed unnecessarily long, just so the movie would be of a reasonable length.<br /><br />for instance when the lead character rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene, with meaningless dialogue which serves no real purpose or necessity to the plot.<br /><br />the lead actor is supposedly carrying out revenge on a woman who sleeps with guys to give them hiv, he never once thinks to get tested. instead he turns into a crazed killer deciding to torture her before killing her and sawing her into pieces.<br /><br />if this sounds good and you are thinking this will have lots of gore, think again. this film has no real gory sequences and is quite tame for this type of film.<br /><br />it does not scare, it does not make you think, it does not offer fast paced fun. it may however put you to sleep, it is certain to bore you to tears, so please save yourself the despair and follow my heading.<br /><br />avoid this film 1/2 out of 10 (this does not deserve even 1)<br /><br />the film was 78 minutes but seemed as if it was 2 1/2 hours.
