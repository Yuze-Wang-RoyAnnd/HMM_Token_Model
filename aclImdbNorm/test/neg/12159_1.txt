as a genghis khan "fan" i was looking forward to this movie. after devouring conn igguldens epic novels about genghis and reading up on loads of historic records i feel i know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...<br /><br />that turned out a deception. this movie is practically made up from beginning to end. there are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. that does not have to be a problem, i like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring. nothing of the greatness comes forth in this movie.<br /><br />i would not recommend this movie if you know anything on the subject.
