hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone`s home movie . drama schools must be full of idiots ! , there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio . hey i think i`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it the greatest romance ever seen or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it the greatest sex ever seen . oh hold on i`m not married and i`ve never been on honeymoon ! not to worry i`ll send in a video of someone elses wedding/honeymoon <br /><br />!!!!! mild spoilers !!!!!<br /><br />you`d think with an opening like that shark hunter could only improve wouldn`t you ? as shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed , best written and best acted part of the film , alas it`s all downhill from here as the family go to sea ( in reality a fog shrouded swimming pool ) in a three foot yacht where mom and dad get eaten by a cgi fin and their son spencer swears revenge against the fin . cut forward to the present day and the french are using an underwater research base for oil exploration . only thing is - and it`s so obvious you can`t fail to notice this - it`s not filmed underwater !!! , the director hasn`t made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank . the underwater research base is blown up by the shark ( maybe it`s hired by greenpeace ? ) killing everyone inside and spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of frenchmen . what else happens ? no idea because i decided to watch something else <br /><br />no hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and i do hope matt codd becomes a big fish in hollywood . you think you know about sharks matt ? you ain`t seen nothing yet
