as many know, this is the feature film debut of edward d. wood jr. as as a writer/producer/director/actor. i have been a fan of ed wood for several years now. while i don't like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of wood during his life. everybody knows that he was a transvestite. this film is about changing one's sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. this film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it. however, the film still contains wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialog, meaningless stock footage, and hokey special effects. throw in wood's usual overdose of bela lugosi hamming it up and you have wood's first attempt at being a director.<br /><br />the plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines. the doctor tells him the story of glen, who is also a transvestite. glen wants to marry barbara, but can't bring himself to tell her about his secret. he also tells the inspector about alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman. bela lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on (lugosi's part really isn't well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for wood to have a star in his film and lugosi to get some cash).<br /><br />all in all, the movie shows the hallmarks of wood's career. it was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly. it definitely has the "it's so bad, it's good" feel to it. however, i do have to applaud ed on his progressive thinking in making this film. transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s. wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on cross-dressing.
