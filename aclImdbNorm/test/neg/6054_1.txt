"embarassing" is the only word to describe this laughingly awful production. from the blatant disregard of the source material (sure to infuriate anyone remotely familiar with mythology) to the predictably insufficient production value, this entire mini-series is a train wreck.<br /><br />the cast (which includes some good actors, whom i pity) delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic "european" accent so common to bad epics. worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and set design (blurring together styles from across time and space) to the score (which seems to poorly mimic many recognizable classical tunes as well as "lord of the rings"). most offensive of all are the visual effects, which single- handedly prove that if you can't afford to do them well, write them out.<br /><br />it pained me to see yet another legendary tale bastardized by a cheap "adaptation." maybe one day, someone will do it right.
