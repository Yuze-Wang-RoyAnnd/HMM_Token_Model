well now this strange movie. it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at. actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film. oh here i go. alex ferns is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change, but apart from that this has no great direction solidly two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama. i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray. i found it hard to empathise for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives. best avoided.
