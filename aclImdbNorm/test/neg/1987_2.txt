this movie tries to be artistic but comes across as puerile as a film school student's first attempt. next it tries to be erotic but comes across as clumsy as a virgin's first attempt. lastly it tries to be cruel & gripping, but aside from kinski's performance--which is powerful but conspicuously misplaced amidst the amateur melodrama--it's about as gripping as your hand around a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering how un-erotic this film is). it features a blowjob scene which is even lamer than chlo"e sevigny's career-burying performance in the brown bunny. run away now while you have the chance. go find yourself a victoria's secret lingerie catalogue instead--it's more artistic and more erotic than this tripe.
