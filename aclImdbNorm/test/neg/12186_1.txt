i watched this movie last night, i'm a huge fan of the book, and i was pretty happy with the version in which winona ryder and susan sarandon starred. but this one, it's just awful. oh my god, i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the switching of beth being the younger sister, and making amy the 3rd one. and jo interpretation, terrible, jo was a feminist, intelligent and kinda angry young lady, and the actress portraying jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl. and what's with the laurie going to war?. i'm ok with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made, but not re-write the whole story. very very bad done.
