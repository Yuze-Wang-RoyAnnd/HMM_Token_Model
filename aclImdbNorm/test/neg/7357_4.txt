when you get ahead of a film, you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question. that is exactly how i felt while i was watching "darkness." i could see anticipate every twist and turn easily. it is a combination of "the amityville horror" and a myriad of films that deal with the occult. it is so silly that i almost found endearing its naiveness. i cannot say i was wholly bored but i found the film way too derivative for my taste. director balaguer'o tries to redo his early spanish hit "the nameless," but he cannot pull it off. i admit, a few sequences were creepy enough but i just abhor when i can figure out what is going to happen next. also, i hated to see good actors like lena olin and giancarlo giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck. finally, anna paquin as the star of a horror film? this must be a joke. she is cute but she is one of those good child actors that have become a very monotonous adult actor. you can live without watching this one.
