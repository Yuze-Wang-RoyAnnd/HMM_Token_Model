this was one of the worst films i have ever seen. i'm still trying to get over how bad it was. just because it has godard's name attached to it, doesn't make it great. beyond the fact it makes absolutely no sense, we see one insanely long shot of a traffic jam that is not stunning, unbelievable or anything of the sort. while this long shot of the traffic jam is going on you will be feeling probably more like making a pastrami sandwich than continuing watching it. pieces of a supposed story, silly, stupid characters. what message are we suppose to take from this? it offers nothing and serves no purpose. the arrogance of the director in showcasing these puny, dull chain-smoking french people and having them sit around and converse for hours on end and then getting it passed off as art is truly astounding.
