and one only, in my opinion.<br /><br />that reason is margaret leighton. she is a wonderful actress, on-stage as well as on the screen. we have few chances to see her, though. i think that's especially true in the united states.<br /><br />here she plays a sympathetic role. not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a bombshell.<br /><br />walter pigeon does not hold up the tradition of drummond performers. he is always reliable but he's not much fun. he's not a rascal or a knave. consequently, this seemed to me a talky endeavor with little action or suspense. but check it out for leighton.
