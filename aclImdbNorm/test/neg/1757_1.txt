jude law, nicole kidman, and renne zelwigger. they are all horrible. especially the star, jude law. <br /><br />it's directed by the same guy who did the english patient and its based on a best selling novel of a man risking all to get back to his lover but unlike the wonderful english pateint, this movie sucks. it is really bad.<br /><br />worst dialogue ever. "but we've only know each other for a moment" "but they were a thousand moments, like diamonds in a bag"<br /><br />or <br /><br />"in some cultures you just have to say i marry you 3 times and you're married" lovey-dovey-"i marry you, i marry you, i marry you, i marry you..."<br /><br />i'm ashamed i sat through it all. <br /><br />the whole movie was awful, horrible....ughh no words, i'm sick.<br /><br />1/10 (the one is for the really loud bullet sounds, the sound crew did a good job)
