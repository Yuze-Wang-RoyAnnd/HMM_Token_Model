the premise of this movie is ugghhhh. the guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "yeah, this is funny, cute, and a good movie." what the hell?!?! what is funny about immature girls fornicating with a married man with a new baby? what is cute about the fact that he is cheating on his wife? what have been wrong with them finding some teenage boys to have sex with before starting college? noooo, that is not good enough, the guy has to be married, off-limits, off-the-market, that's the one we gotta have. dumb-ass girls! then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the guy. no, she just "loves" the way he makes her feel. two of the girls are having fun with it, they think it is funny and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they are doing. it just shameless, but yeah this is all good with everyone one this website. the dark-haired girl even has the audacity to have her dad pick her up from the guys house, under the ruse of baby sitting. this is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife? poor woman working and paying the bills while he screws the baby sitter.
