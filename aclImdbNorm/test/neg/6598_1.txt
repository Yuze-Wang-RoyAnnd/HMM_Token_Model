the writers and creators of this film should actually be sued... for polluting the world with this crap! "man in the mirror" is in fact beyond horrible! way, way, way beyond! <br /><br />...and people, i'm not just saying that because i'm a michael jackson-fan! or due to the fact that this is truly one of the most retarded depictions of his life i've ever encountered! <br /><br />i'm saying it because this is a waste of time, money and celluloid! i feel ashamed of myself just having seen all of it! that's 1 hour and 26 min of my life i'll never get back! i'm telling you; watching grass grow is literally more entertaining than this film! <br /><br />consider yourselves warned!
