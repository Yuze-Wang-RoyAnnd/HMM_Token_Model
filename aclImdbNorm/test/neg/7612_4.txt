i found this film extremely disturbing. treadwell is delusional and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness. the footage shown is him and not an actor, but yet it is showing behaviour that ended in death. is it appropriate to show actual footage of a suicide? let's not mince words. the film shows footage of behaviour that directly led to his death.<br /><br />for those who think that treadwell is some kind of hero, think again. the footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to be helping. he did no meaningful research into their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them. all he did was run around in the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else. reality is, by helping to desensitize the animals to humans, he exposed them to great risk. his self indulgent behaviour not caused his own death, but also the death of his companion amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm.<br /><br />but i'm also concerned about werner herzog's actions in compiling this film the way he did.<br /><br />a friend and i have had a long argument about this film who loved this film. he believes that seriously disturbed people make for interesting subjects and he cites the movie downfall as an example. but in downfall they use actors. we didn't see the real madga goebells put cyanide capsules into her own children's mouths.<br /><br />there was something about using the real footage in grizzly man which reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were being crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped, elected to simply keep recording the horror.<br /><br />herzog's film shows us that treadwell's footage is more about treadwell. but herzog has done the same. his own personality and opinions are aired in this documentary, which is supposedly about someone else. scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not necessary. we already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. we didn't need herzog shedding a tear with one of treadwell's former girlfriends. it didn't add to the film.<br /><br />the film showed us that treadwell was very self-indulgent, but it also showed us that herzog is as well.
