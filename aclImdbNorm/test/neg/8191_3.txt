i accidentally happened upon this movie when i was looking for something to watch while eating lunch. i actually turned to the we network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of "sticking it" for some gymnastics team -- i figured cheesy goodness. well, i got cheesy alright. <br /><br />first, i missed a good 20-40 minutes at the start of the movie. luckily, most of it was recapped fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist.<br /><br />i love jenny garth and will watch her in just about anything. she's just so pretty, and i want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers always does. she looks great throughout this movie, and doesn't really age over what seems to be more than a decade. <br /><br />overall, i felt bad for the actors as i watched this movie. all of them tried to sell their parts, but all were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle. frankly, i was surprised to see terry farrell and mitch ryan (greg's dad from dharma & greg) in this. <br /><br />but the writing was not the worst part of this movie. about a half-hour before the end, her mother dies, and when they show the headstone the death date is 1979. having missed the beginning, i had gotten the impression from the wardrobe that this was taking place in the 80s. not one leisure suit or bell bottom in sight. shame on the person who did wardrobe for this film! don't get me wrong -- all the outfits in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for the time period. it almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe person that it was a period piece.<br /><br />bottom line -- good for a laugh or to feed a jennie garth fix. :)
