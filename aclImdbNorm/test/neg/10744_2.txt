i can appreciate satire that goes against my own views but it must be witty and well-placed. this film is...how can i possibly explain it. it does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. in fact, it's hardly even horror. dead soldiers come to life but they're not interested in brains, only in voting booths. why? cue a never-ending stream of the most idiotic, banal, bloated windbag ravings of "bad president, bad conservatives, bad republicans." what a self-indulgent, schmaltzy, cornball piece of hog manure this was.<br /><br />even if they agree with the episode's "points," only the stupidest of liberals would say they enjoyed watching it. then again, assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazed, angry, hostile, anti-social and anti-anything-halfway-normal liberal spectrum is a tall task in itself.<br /><br />avoid like a liberal convention.
