why is it that such "romantic" movies that never actually go anywhere, always start (and probably end) with crappy jazz? it's not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tv-movie. this film was sappy, slow paced, boring, unoriginal, wooden and did i say boring?<br /><br />harrison ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude, but he was just a crawling, mumbling cop that seemed to walk into the congress-woman's home like everything was fine, when he behaved like a pervert - staring at thomas with a pervy glare, hardly ever bothering to speak.<br /><br />and why the hell do they always get british actors to put on crappy accents - they're casted because they're famous, and everybody knows they're british precisely because they're famous!
