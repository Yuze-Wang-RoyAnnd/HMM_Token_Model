i found super troopers only mildly amusing at best (seemed like a glorified police academy ripoff to me), and i rented this movie in hopes of it being better. it wasn't.<br /><br />the writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this film is even worse. it doesn't feel like a whole lot happens in this film, or that it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the characters.<br /><br />the actor who plays felix is totally uninspired, though possibly due in part to the dialogue he had to work with. in short, this movie just went wrong in so many places.<br /><br />i get the impression that since films like clerks, independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long, rambling scenes of dialogue where characters are trying to be funny. but, where dialogue in clerks pushes the story forward, in this movie, it hopelessly weighs it down. films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue, and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of snappy, funny dialogue, it just doesn't always work. especially if they're not that good at writing dialogue. i hate to say it, but even "extreme heist" was more interesting than this movie- and that movie was so low-budget it was shot on video.
