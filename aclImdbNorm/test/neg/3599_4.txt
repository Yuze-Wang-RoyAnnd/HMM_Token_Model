ewww! a disney sequel that is rubbish! who would have thought it? actually, quite a lot judging by the comments here, and they aren't wrong. i actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original. and therein lies disney's whole "cash-in" mentality. shovel out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it. don't think they are that cynical? ask yourself this, then....how many disney films have sequels? and then....how many of those sequels spawn a follow-up? a significantly lower number.<br /><br />kronk's new groove is just another example of this. the plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out. even more annoying was the increased number of "out of place" items and scenes - an old folks home for example and, god forbid an aztec version of the boy scouts! worse yet, kronk's opposing chippamunk leader has a completely bewildering over-the-top english accent for no reason whatsoever. an accent that was, after a very short while, intensely grating on the nerves.<br /><br />there are a couple of good things. the animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the sub-standard dialogue they are given - especially warburton in the lead role. but other than this there really is nothing to recommend it. sure, little kids may like it, but there is little to amuse mum and dad whilst they sit through this tortuous maiming of the original concept.<br /><br />avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you'd use in avoiding a pack of ravening man-eating lions.
