first, this movie was made in 1978. so that tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway.but i am not saying that all old movies are bad . second, the special effects we're terrible for even that time. finally, the acting was so bad, bozo the clown could have done it better. it makes you wonder how people get the money to make movies this pathetic. this movie sucks!
