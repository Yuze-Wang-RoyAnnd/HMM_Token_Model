fox is pretty lame. they cancel the wrong shows. it's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like "arrested development" and yet they keep this show and "war at home". i feel that fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy "married with children", but now it's just getting ridiculous. "the loop" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. in order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. "family guy" and "the simpons" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe. i mean, if you're going to invest money into making something entertaining, make it entertaining. also, stop using "no-named" actors. it's great to have up-and-comers, but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity. duh, fox.
