note, i only saw approximately the last half of this movie, so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate, that being said, seeing what i saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a one-star rating for this is enough.<br /><br />in short, it's a dismal-plot slaughter of the wonderful precursor (nl christmas vacation) with chevy chase, only it doesn't have chevy chase in it, and it takes place in a generic tropical island, essentially with no connection to christmas at all.<br /><br />ol' chevy probably didn't want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun, instead they got the screwy cousin eddie, who, again, was great in the original, but in this he is just over the top, and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting. the attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trumps it, and considering that this is supposed to be comedy, i doubt i need to say more.<br /><br />this is not to be seen for its qualities, for it has none, but for it's failings and again, how hollywood is spilling it's life's blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buck.<br /><br />i think i'll watch the original before the upcoming christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence, from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just high-budget, but mindless, garbage.
