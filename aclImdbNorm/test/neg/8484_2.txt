spoilers<br /><br />i love movies. i've seen a lot of movies. i didn't think i'd ever see a film that i actually hated. son of the mask ruined it. son of the mask is so bad i'm not even going to do a detailed comment like i usually do. in fact, i'm not even going to write a lot. i think all of you should know that this movie is horribly awful. and poor jamie kennedy. he was awesome in scream, but now this film! also, this film takes a smo-can film and turns it into this goofy kids film that not even kids will like. this film also consists of very rude humor. like the nose woman. she has a nose for a head and when she sneezes white stuff spews out of her nose. there is also an exorcist parody. yes, a kid film has an adult parody. maybe they thought the adults would like it. quite frankly, it made the film even more cheesier and crude.<br /><br />here's the basic, stupid plot. tim avery's dog gets the amazing loki mask and turns into a cartoon dog thing. when tim is paying more attention to the baby with special powers, cartoon dog becomes a wiley coyote ripoff. then loki takes the baby with amazing powers and tim and loki have a really cheesy animated fight. tim's wearing the mask. it all ends happy. too bad this movie is horrible. <br /><br />overall, the original the mask was a fantastic jim carrey movie. this, basically is not. please, please, don't rent, buy, or download this movie. i made a terrible mistake renting this. i don't want you guys to make that same exact mistake. i feel horrible that i couldn't write a detailed comment, but really, what's there to comment on?<br /><br />2/10 i'd give it a one, but come on, it's basically a kid film.<br /><br />recommended films: the mask.
