who reads these comments may think we may have in hand a great movie. i am portuguese and i'm ashamed that this film became a blockbuster in portugal. it can't really call this cinema. the direction and "mise-en-scene" is basic (even ron howard does better!); the script is bad and pretentious (a really bad tarantino); the cast is covered in tv stars, models and reality show stars that don't no nothing about acting. when you put in a movie this ingredients of course that the fans of this kind of tv shows will all go see. i am also surprised that people who make comments here in imdb say that this movie is a masterpiece. i thought that this site was only for people who truly like cinema and understand a little bit of it. all the movies made to be blockbusters in portgal always use the same ingredients and are always awful. if you think this movie is reasonable, please don't say your love movies and cinema.
