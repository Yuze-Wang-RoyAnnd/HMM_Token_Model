this has to be one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune to see. the general idea of a coronal mass ejection hitting the planet earth with em disruption is fair enough, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155of? the acting was so terrible i got the feeling that the casting agents simply grabbed a handful of people off of santa monica boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. in all honesty i have seen less wooden acting from my ironing board. sorry, but this film was poor, poor, poor.
