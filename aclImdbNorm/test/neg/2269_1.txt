this is not a good movie at all. i cannot believe that after fifty years, this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from marathi cinema that have been so systematically ignored. this is a very overrated movie that got very, very lucky. it was given the national award, harvested the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience. anyone with even a marginal understanding of good, quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscars.<br /><br />i cannot understand where to start. there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award. that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this movie.<br /><br />the topic chosen is great. it is important that such movies be made
