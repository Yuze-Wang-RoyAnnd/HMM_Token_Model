this film is sometimes called 'the story of o-pt.2',which tries to pass itself off as a sequel (of sorts)to the french erotic s&m thriller 'the story of o'. although i've never seen the original version, i did, however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual & social politics. i guess the 'o' angle comes from the occasional s&m overtones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to watch) as the ones in 'mistress'. klaus kinski is the only recognizable face in this french/japanese production (but speaks his lines in english--at least in the version i saw). the unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious (what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water?). it's obvious that after the whole "porno chic" trend in cinema petered out (ouch-sorry,bad pun!)about 1975, producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema,not to mention foreign/art cinema,so film goers had to contend with dreck like 'the last woman',and others like it.
