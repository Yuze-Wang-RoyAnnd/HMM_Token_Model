i hardly know where to begin.<br /><br />huge continuity issues, bad acting, etc. for example, sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head.<br /><br />but the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, sam's adventurousness paving the way to improve the lot of his entire family, is not even touched upon. instead, in the movie, he gets ticked off at his family and leaves his wealthy parents to be by himself and, when he gets tired of it, he goes home. where is his development? where is the arc?<br /><br />if you have never read the book and can get through the hokey 60isms (double/triple/quadruple visions of the falcon) and terrible production quality (crackling, ahem, fire, winter winds stopping their howling for the dialog and then restarting, etc.) i guess it *might* be ok for an 8 year old. <br /><br />but compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment. <br /><br />read the book instead.
