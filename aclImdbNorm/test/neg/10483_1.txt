"a texas community is beset with a rash of mysterious killings involving some of the students from the local college. the sheriff investigating the death discovers the startling identity of the killer responsible for the murders. a nasa experiment involving cosmic rays has mutated an ape and turned it into an unstoppable killing machine with a thirst for blood," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />or, could the creature really be a mutated alligator returning from a space-bound "noah's ark"? <br /><br />a long opening, with laughably straight 1960s couple ralph baker jr. (as chris) and dorothy davis (as judy), suggests "night fright" might be a joyously bad movie; but, don't get your hopes up. after some innocent cavorting, the attractive collegiates discover another couple has encountered a monster; naturally, the creature is hell-bent on terrorizing young romantics. sheriff john agar (as clint crawford) isn't trusted by the younger set; but, he really wants to help.<br /><br />mr. agar was a friend of my aunt; he spoke about very few movies, and this wasn't one of them.
