words almost fail me to describe how terrible this irish vanity project (funded by canadian taxpayers - both federal and albertan) really is.<br /><br />there's a sudden appearance by a nice looking canadian woman (kathy ranheim) who in real life was a star athlete in alberta, for no other reason to ensure canadian content. credits also indicate that certain calgary pubs were of assistance.<br /><br />everything here is poorly filmed and at least third-hand (chunks of poorly digested trainspotting, lock stock, snatch and reservoir dogs are the most obvious steals). avoid like the plague unless you fancy one of those campy "so bad it's almost funny" nights in front of your telly.
