i bought this chuck norris dvd knowing that it was one of his earliest films, and it shows. we all know that he will never win an oscar for his acting, but that's not what we watch him for. although there have been a few earthquakes in california since this movie was made, there never was any desert or hills between hwy.99 and i 5. billy was supposedly crossing over from 99 to 5 along 120, a distance of less that 15 miles. i wish that the writers, producers and directors of these movies would, at least, look at a map. as a truck driver who spends a lot of time in california, i could tell right from the start that the geography was wrong. however, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. so grab your doritos and an adult beverage and enjoy a trip back in time.
