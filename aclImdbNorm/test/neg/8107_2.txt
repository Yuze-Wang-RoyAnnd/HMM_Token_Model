i wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to european wimps and the united nations. what a load of right-wing crud! incidentally, the bit about canada joining the us didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. the only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for president(but they could have just made him american and dispensed with that). in any event, this was a load of bull and not worth your time. if you wan't to see this kind of thing done well, check out the brilliant bbc political thriller "state of play."
