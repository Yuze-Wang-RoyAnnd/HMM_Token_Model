<br /><br />i thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had. this is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week. the original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel. one good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly, because the plot seemed rushed. when rachel's best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. another bring down was the involvement of amy irving. all her scenes brought down the movies pace. the dialog in this movie was terrible. it in no way reflected the way kids talk. in conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene.
