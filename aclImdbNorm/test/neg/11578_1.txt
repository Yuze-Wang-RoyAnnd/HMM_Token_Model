i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. the acting is ridiculous. half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.<br /><br />the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen. i think there are puppet shows with more believability. they can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold. <br /><br />if asked to summarise the movie, i would say that someone had rustled up a group of complete no-hopers at the local county-fair, slapped them on an island, added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing.<br /><br />i can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released, recorded on dvd and costs $6 from my local video store for one day. if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film.<br /><br />i hate this movie with great intensity. why? i wish i knew captain, i wish i knew....
