i don't mind some adult humor, but this feature was just downright dirty. the first 10 minutes consisted of pryor swearing at some guy taking pictures, followed my even more profanities. i don't know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because i walked out. after seeing this i never looked at richard pryor the same way again. and to think that he actually went on to host a childrens' show.<br /><br />if profanity and tasteless, unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh, then you'll probably enjoy this. but if you're an "old-fashioned" type, then don't bother.
