i'm sorry, but i cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought "ethan mao" was. i have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! warning: i am going to give away a key element to the "plot". after holding his family hostage overnight, ethan lets his vile, evil, hated step-mom go to the bank - alone!!! - to retrieve the piece of his late mom's jewellery which he so desperately wants. guess what? she calls the cops! wow ... what a twist! i couldn't see that coming at all.<br /><br />the only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes.<br /><br />pure, unadulterated rubbish!
