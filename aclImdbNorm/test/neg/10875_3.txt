tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. the acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star larry bishop to get laid. the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with qt. the plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older b-movies and some cameos from guys like david carradine, dennis hopper, and vinnie jones. each one is listless in their performance, particularly hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career. the saving grace, if there is one, is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining. bishop tries so hard to get that trademark tarentino banter and just fails miserably, which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others. i'd only check this one out if you love bad movies...or if you're really into biker films.
