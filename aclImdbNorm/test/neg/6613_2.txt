this movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "let's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era! and let's cast brian dennehey as coach bobby knight!" that's where this movie went terribly wrong. why cast an actor who bears no semblance of the man he's portraying? and then, why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight, but brian dennehey in a red sweater? as i sat watching this movie on espn, i didn't find myself believing this man was actually coach knight. he didn't look like him, talk like him, act like him, or even walk like him. i could not get past this fact, and thusly, i could not enjoy the movie. when paul newman and robert redford were cast as the outlaws butch cassidy and the sundance kid, we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until we saw the movie. but, with someone as visible in today's media as coach knight, you have to do better. when anthony hopkins was cast as nixon, it was the same situation. but, anthony hopkins made us believe he in fact was nixon. dennehey didn't even try. what might have been a great movie was turned sour by this. besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the four-letter word what "saving private ryan" did for dismemberment, it stunk. too little of the real coach knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this movie into a "season to turn off half-way through the broadcast." the only good thing about this is that it was television movie. i didn't have to waste my hard-earned money on this piece of trash.
