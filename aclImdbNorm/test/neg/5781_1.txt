be very afraid of anyone who likes this film. they probably inhaled too many paint chips as a child. its so awful i refuse to relive a plot. o yeah, there wasn't one! this movie is a true definition of what hollywood creates for people who don't want to think at a theatre. do the bad guys win? do the good guys win? who cares!
