this must be the most boring film i ever saw. the only positive i can say about it is that thankfully i didn't pay to see it. we were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start. this piece of junk is a badly filmed, way too long film. the actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present. the only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. they might find some of the interviews interesting. a different edit might have made an interesting documentary of this, but i doubt it, the interviews shown were not engaging in any way. as it is, it is just a tragedy, both to behold and to be a part of. avoid this film at any cost!
