while it's one of two movies on tales of voodoo volume 1, there's no voodoo or anything supernatural in it! the box labels it "hell hole" but the screen title is escape from hell hole. the title is confusingly similar to hell hole (1978) aka "escape from women's hell hole" a group of women bathe in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom, who they easily overpower. no nudity in this or any other scene, however.<br /><br />a woman named cardena drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women. she invites indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle m.g. once they get there, it becomes clear that m.g. wants to take indri's virginity. m.g. runs some sort of house of prostitution, and he's either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military, or runs a paramilitary outfit, or prefers for his guards to all wear military-style uniforms.<br /><br />the women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison. indri gets sent there. the women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guards.<br /><br />various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made, but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages the women have: they outnumber the guards vastly, and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or handguns.<br /><br />wip genre enthusiasts may like it, and the fact that it was made in the philippines gives it some novelty, but otherwise... eh.
