the only good thing about persepolis is the shadows created in the german expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. this movie bored me. it was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. it comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties. mind you, she is torn between cultures and doesn't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real. she is listening to ever-so-many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of iran. the only thing i received from this movie was angst.
