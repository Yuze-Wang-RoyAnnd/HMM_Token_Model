okay, so this was made way back in 1993. directed loosely by robert iscove and written loosely by john miglis, it's supposed to be based on a true story. hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. for certainly it was obvious from the beginning that this dame was after all she could get.<br /><br />tim matheson, looking somewhat older than i remember him, played the empty headed man who was looking for romance in his somewhat dull and empty life. well, it came to him in the likes of tracy pollan, a somewhat vacant looking girl with kinky sex as her means of conquering her guys.<br /><br />come on, phone sex, even in the 90s was old hat. can't believe someone would fall for that old line. but mr. matheson seemed to buy it. and it cost him plenty. <br /><br />the hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the dame out of his apartment, putting all her junk in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then had the stupidity not to change the locks. that's when i had enough of this trite movie. it made me want to wish the dame had tried it on me so i could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a hike.<br /><br />i give this chestnut a 1 out of 100. that's how bad i thought it was. i guess you can't blame the actors. but they were awful. did they actually try to play this with a straight face?
