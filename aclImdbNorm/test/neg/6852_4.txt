this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and... i stopped caring. this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex. there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment. also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...<br /><br />sounds promising?<br /><br />not really.<br /><br />i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film. basically i started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up.<br /><br />it may work for you, it didn't for me.
