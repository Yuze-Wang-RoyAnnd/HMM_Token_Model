scanning through the comments, there doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this movie, and it's not very hard to see why, it's rubbish.<br /><br />now, i will start by saying that the finished product was hurt, in any number of ways, by the death of donald pleasance (dr loomis) in post production. this required a re-jigging of the film's conclusion with loomis buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with micheal swapping places with mysterious "man in black" and i do not mean johnny cash.<br /><br />now to the story. the fifth movie ended rather unsatisfactorily with micheal myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black. it turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of micheal's evil and is also a colleague of dr loomis named dr wynn. they also kidnapped jamie lloyd (played by danielle harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by jc brandy). jamie, pregnant, escapes from dr wynn's lair and so micheal follows her and kills her. but she'd had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew.<br /><br />we hear some ludicrous explanation to micheal's evil involving gaelic curses down bloodlines and mysterious symbols. a radio show is broadcast from micheal's home town for some reason, which gives micheal some more hapless victims.<br /><br />in the end the movie, just like this review is vague, confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending.<br /><br />some sex scenes and nudity. poor plot, passable effects, with some good run of the mill slasher kills, but severely lacking in motivation. for what was supposed to explain everything, this only stirred up some new questions, made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in pleasance to end his life and career.
