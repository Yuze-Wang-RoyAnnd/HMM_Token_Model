why a film maker with a track record like wes craven would want to lend his name to a tedious collection of cliches like this is anyone's guess. and if he did stump up any money for it - all of lb50 judging by the looks - he should have been banging on the director's door for a refund the minute the film was released. there are many "alien" rip-offs and this is one of the worst. even the reliable lance henriksen, saddled with a character dumb enough to allow his kids to wander around a dangerous government lab, can't save it. as a cure for insomnia, this rates a 10+. as a piece of quality film making - forget it.
