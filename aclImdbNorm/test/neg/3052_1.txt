worst movie i have ever seen! 90 minutes of excruciating film-making. all the ingredients to make this movie a true work of crap. bad acting, bad directing, bad storytelling, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects, and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters. it also threw in a terrible naked shot of a dumb blond, and a breast shot of a stupid asian girl, and both attempts were just scary, since these girls are ugly. some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but this could never be considered one of them. kevin tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in storytelling: he introduced characters at the end of the movie (an old man and old woman). i would vote for it below a 1 out of 10 but the voting system doesn't work that way apparently. right from the title sequence i knew it would suck and i would return my dvd but best buy doesn't refund dvds, or consumable products as they call it, or so my receipt says. i have "the dunwich horror" and that was truly god-awful, but i still feel that "night of the demons" (an obvious evil dead rip-off) was far worse than "dunwich horror." this is just like "the howling," how in the hell could sequels get milked out of this anorexic cow??? save your money and get the "texas chainsaw massacre" (just don't get any of its sequels though) or "the evil dead" or "dawn of the dead." "night of the demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. every second of it was just maddening, excruciating pain for the audience, because the whole movie all-around was horrible! do yourself a favor, don't see it! you'll be saving some brain cells.
