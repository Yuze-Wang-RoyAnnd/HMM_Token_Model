i have to say this is better than most syfy outings, but that isn't saying much.<br /><br />the plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the spanish inquisition (and nobody ever expects the spanish inquisition!) he and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.<br /><br />what then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the final destination movies. it has the puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the cop who wants the game to bring back his family... but otherwise, it's just a mess.
