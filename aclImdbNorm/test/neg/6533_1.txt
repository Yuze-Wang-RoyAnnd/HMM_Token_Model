this movie is ridiculous. it's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible. the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it's a comedy. truly is bad cinematography. you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there's a few jokes here and there going on but either way they're all inside jokes amongst themselves. this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. it really is a very pointless movie.their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway. unless you want to be bored out of your ass, i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.
