there no doubt in one mined that this movie is stupid and unfunny joke, but tell the truth it is quite entertaining (if you re first time viewer and try not to analyzed anything) over all the movie have a very good ideas but badly written.<br /><br />the story of the two losers, waking up to find out that they can't remember what happen to them the day before. only to find out later that they are after by the angry twin girl friends, aliens, transsexual stripper, aliens nerds and some gangs members. <br /><br />isn't it like the bourne identity? yeah yeah, i know - how can i compare the two movies, but what the hell? they both have no memories; peoples were after them and so on. <br /><br />anyway the movie is stupid and is only for the viewer that like stupid movie. <br /><br />reason to watch: . loads of young talented actors, . very stupid (after all you know it a stupid movie, why not make it extreme)<br /><br />reason not to: . if you like to analyzed, then forget it, . talented young actors turn bad, . good plod turn really bad<br /><br />rating: 4/10 (grade: e+)<br /><br />------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- --------- --------- ----<br /><br />'dude where's my car' -wait, what do you expected from ashton kutcher's movie. i think almost every people got the same answer for this guy - 'a really stupid movie'. apart from 'that 70s' shows' this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (he should thank the series for his reputation). 'dude where's my car', is one of his trademark -'stupidity'. somehow his film is even worst than adam sandler's movies, (can you imagine that). the movie is really non-sense, no story line, and no nothing. mara sokoloff, jennifer garner, alison sweeney and s.w.scoot should not have wasted their talent on this garbage. they even came up with 'seriously, dude where's my car'. this shows how the movie companies are dying of making money rather than quality.<br /><br />max: 4/10<br /><br />recommendation: borrow it from your friends or just forget about it
