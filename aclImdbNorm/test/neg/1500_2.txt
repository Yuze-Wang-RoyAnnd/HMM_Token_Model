this one features an interesting way of handling a camera,<br /><br />espercially for a dtv movie - the version i saw was full-screen<br /><br />- but it falls short on the scenario department. first you get<br /><br />around 20mn of talk, talk, talk in a would-be-hip, post-"trainspotting" way, then it's slasher city. and then comes<br /><br />the most dishonest cheat ending i've seen, much worse than<br /><br />"april fool's day" - where at least it made sense. so, all in<br /><br />all, it's the old song and dance : interesting director tries<br /><br />hard, but deserves better movie. funny : usually, it is the actors which are in desperate need of<br /><br />something better
