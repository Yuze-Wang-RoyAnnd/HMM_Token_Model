this movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest repute) who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop. upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there (even though its only 15 miles away), so they walk. when they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby. they soon find that something isn't right here and fort mcmillan (ft. doom as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. <br /><br />rather than go into the plot line i will make some comments about things i noticed about the movie. first off the acting is very flat, only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in. my first though was poor acting, but at the end i watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive. so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it. on top of the bad acting i have a great problem where the people don't react right to a given set of circumstances. take for example no one would take them to ft mcmillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away. yet when we arrive at the fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people, all of whom must get supplies from some one, not to mention mail etc. it is supposed to take place in 1867, yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights (they aren't on at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general style of locomotives so popular at that time. there are also places where you can see paved blacktop, (and maybe a car at one point, didn't want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. if they had followed the rules of the "world" they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 i gave it, and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better.
