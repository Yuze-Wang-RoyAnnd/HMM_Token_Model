the movie starts off as we see a footage of a huge drought back in the 30's in america. then a short story is shown about a creepy - looking farmer elija who made a deal with satan , to get good harvest. elija hired young men to work in his garden , killed them , and used as scarecrows. he also fed the ground with their blood. some time after 2 cops come to visit him. one of them gets shot by elija , another one kills the farmer himself... after that , the present day is shown , and some guy named sean is told that he has an old farm left as inheritance. he decides to go there with some friends to see what's up. little did sean know that the next night is the "payback night".....<br /><br />as for me this movie had a good story for a horror flick , but low budget and poor special effects just ruined it. "dark harvest" is a perfect example of lazy film making. for example we see a scarecrow (a usual guy wearing a funny , cheap mask) chasing a girl. when he raises his hand we get to see a normal human skin below his glove, instead of some rotting flesh. the gore is not very impressive as well. there are some nasty killings by our "lovely" scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. surprisingly the acting is somewhat ok in this flick , or i better say its believable. some nude scenes are presented as well for the fans (even a lesbian scene) ,but those scenes don't save it.<br /><br />verdict : good music, good story, solid acting. but awful effects , cheap gore and plot holes slow this movie down. not really recommended.
