did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews? i mean, really, it's a bit hackneyed, and spike isn't that funny. he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny. there are so many mediocre gigs in this show; like once, the opening sketch was "talk show, apply directly to the forehead," over and over. and another that featured spike and another dude getting high, and it wasn't even funny. they didn't even do anything but sit around and laugh, over and over. ha ha! and another that featured spike talking to a korean guy who ate duck and told him that he had a pet duck. ha ha! i mean, really, spike just gets funny guests on his show, that's why people like this show
