this movie easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond that to actually insulting. i mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play? from beginning to end we bombarded with quaids overacting and ridiculous facial expressions, laying on the "im a loose cannon" act a little thick. another picking point i had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. i mean in one scene where lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top, just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of. then lewis begins to play his rendition of "a whole lot of shaking'" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world. these kind of scenes, of which there are numerous, coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter. so all in all this film is not worth viewing for anyone not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actors decisions for an hour and a half.
