as usual, leader leo gorcey (as slip mahoney) and "the bowery boys" are hard-pressed for cash. after unsuccessfully trying to sell their old jalopy, the lads look for help at the local bank. there, hapless huntz hall (as sach) has his picture taken by pretty photographer teala loring (as cathy smith). but, since the shot was snapped during a robbery, it makes mr. hall look like the prime suspect. with pals bobby jordan (as bobby), william "billy" benedict (as whitey), and david gorcey (as chuck); mr. gorcey wants to clear hall, and collect the $1,000 reward money. "bowery bombshell" goes through the motions, with ms. loring a main strength.<br /><br />**** bowery bombshell (7/20/46) phil karlson ~ leo gorcey, huntz hall, teala loring, bobby jordan
