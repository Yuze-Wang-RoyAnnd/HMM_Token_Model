i am a huge amy adams fan and have been for many years. i am also a big fan of musicals. with that said this is not a good movie on any level. it is quite dull and the acting overall is very very poor. amy adams is awkward to watch act with scott g. anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting. all the performances come off as very amateur. the music performances are pleasant, but nothing special. <br /><br />scott g. anderson is just an bad actor! i assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice, but it's just not the case. he has an average voice and sings on key, but that's about it.<br /><br />i guess i can see why amy adams did this movie with the singing element i just wish she had not. i could rant about other poor elements of this movie, but i'll leave it at that.
