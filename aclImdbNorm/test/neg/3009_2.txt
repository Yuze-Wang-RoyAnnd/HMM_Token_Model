most of the films i really like are art-house fare and seldom appear on the box-office top-ten lists. that said, i found "northfork" utterly incomprehensible. i have no idea what it was even about. writing in the new york times about a different film, stephen holden once observed that some people seem to think they can throw just anything up on the screen and have it work as a fairy tale. i thought of that review several times while watching "northfork".<br /><br />on a scale of one to ten, i gave it a two.
