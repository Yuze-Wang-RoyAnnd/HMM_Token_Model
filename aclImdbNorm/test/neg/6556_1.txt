especially if you love horrible movies. when i first started watching it, all i could say was "i hope there's a dance sequence in it." imagine my delight when not only did the two main characters dance, but the main ghost began break dancing as well. and on top of that, sherman hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song). it makes me a little sad that he went broke because of this movie, but i've never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better. not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other films he directed!).<br /><br />one note of warning, though, the writer seemed to really like jokes about the, um, male lower regions. for example, one of the characters discovers a book called "groins of the darker species." i am not kidding. and that, to me, is the most disturbing part of the film. other than that, find the most obscure video rental store in your town, get the movie, invite all your friends over, and laugh until you cry with ghost fever.
