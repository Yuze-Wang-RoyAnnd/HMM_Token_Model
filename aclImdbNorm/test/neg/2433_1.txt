i cannot believe this show was okay-ed. first off j.p. manoux does a horrible job filling in for david spade and pacha's voice is too deep compared to john goodman's. the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid!!! the only good thing about this show is that eartha kitt and patrick warburton remain as the voices of yzma and kronk. this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. half of the episodes are copied of the movie. in my opinion the emperor's new groove was one of the best children's movies in years, but they complety ruined by making kronk's new groove and this show. you should watch such shows as spongebob, fairly oddparents, danny phantom, or kim possible but not this show.
