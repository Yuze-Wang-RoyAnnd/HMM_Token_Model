you see a movie titled 'battlespace', what are you going to think? space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other. what do you get with this movie? well, you do get some space battle goodness, but for a great majority of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing. no one talks!!!! what is this nonsense?! we get a narrators, and a ton of british computers, but thats about it. the main protagonist must be the worst one i have ever seen, as she doesn't even have any dialog, and sleepwalks though scenes (literately!). some of the things happening are just stupid, like they use a rocket (like to go to space) for basic transportation planet side, why not just use one of those nifty space ships? in any case, the music is almost non-existent, with a few boring dull lifeless samples, but the main thing you will notice is the atari sound effects the ships use...you have got to be kidding me. i can also tell that the budget was low, because everything looks fake, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie. i seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits it is so bad, making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is. i am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had, because their is very little here (if you can't tell already that is my main gripe here, as i probably said that like 3 times already).
