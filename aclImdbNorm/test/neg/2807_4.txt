as was mentioned before in other comments, the major problem of nva is that it cannot decide what it wants to be, slapstick of the cheapest kind or an honest parody of the east german army. there are a couple of moments which are quite moving, for example when one of the recruits returns from the army prison in schwedt with a completely broken personality. but in the end, leander haussmann goes for the infantile humour. no wonder the film flopped at the german box office as it's historically untruthful to the real situation in those training camps and led by an actor who is unfortunately incapable of giving a nuanced performance.<br /><br />however, there is the camera work of frank griebe who - as always - does a wonderful job. if it wasn't for his beautiful images i would have rated the film far worse.
