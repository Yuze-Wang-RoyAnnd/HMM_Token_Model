this film did not excite me. while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it. the action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags during the middle of the film.<br /><br />one thing that i did not quite follow is how borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards.<br /><br />the other thing that i did not particularly like was the missing segment of khan's life. it did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long. <br /><br />overall, i rate this movie a (4) because i enjoyed the action sequences, but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialog left me less than impressed...
