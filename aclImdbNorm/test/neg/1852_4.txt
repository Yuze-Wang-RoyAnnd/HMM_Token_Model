michael caine usually appears in either very good ("blame it on rio", "sleuth", "without a clue", "gambit", "dirty rotten scoundrels") or truly bad comedies ("noises off", "death becomes her", "harry & walter go to ny"). this falls into the latter category.<br /><br />ta is a comedy that succeeds in only two things: managing to waste a cast that includes caine, gambon and richardson, all of which have comedic abilities, and succeeding in its mission not to make the viewer laugh. there isn't a single truly funny moment here. the main reason is the lousy script; there was so much futile effort put into writing a pointlessly convoluted story which is simply too bothersome to follow (considering it's only a comedy) that the writer(s) forgot to make the damn thing funny, which, as far as i can recall, is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be.<br /><br />i've never seen this moron before. some people even say "if you're a moron fan you'll love this" bla bla bla. a moron fan? does this non-descript person really have fans? a comedy as badly written as this requires a mega-talent to eke out a laugh or two out of it, someone like steve coogan and not your average moron.<br /><br />if you're going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them out to be the utter morons that they usually are. the characters of caine and moron are insufficiently dumb.<br /><br />the single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl. only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it's wise to include a super-intelligent wise-ass kid. smart-a** kids aren't even funny to bill cosby fans any more. in "little miss sunshine" we had a totally normal kid and she was very funny. this stupid ol' the-kid-is-smarter-than-the-adults shtick belongs to a century-old marx brothers film.
