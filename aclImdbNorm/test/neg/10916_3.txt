1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen. christine, the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other. while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch, christine and cujo were both pretty bad, and it's a close-run thing as to which is the lesser of the two. if pushed for an answer i'd say cujo - marginally - is the weakest.<br /><br />donna trenton (dee wallace, fresh from success as elliot's mom in "e.t - the extra terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to husband vic (daniel hugh-kelly) is hanging by a thread. she's been having an affair with a local worker, and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband. dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton (danny pintauro), son of donna and vic, and a pretty messed-up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks. donna and tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics' yard for repairs, but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt. things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic, joe camber (ed lauter), isn't there (he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo, a gigantic st. bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) soon, the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims. the weather is swelteringly hot; not a living soul knows they're there; the car won't start; and the dog seriously wants their blood......<br /><br />cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller, but it never really clicks into gear. i've read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for king - so it's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little. on the printed page, king was at least able to generate a degree of tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st. bernard simply isn't very scary. the "visualness" of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st. bernard. in the book, it was possible to forget this. in the book, cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster. even with the relatively short running-time of an hour-and-a-half, cujo becomes a tedious and patience-straining experience, occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be. they've even omitted the book's cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an "all's well that ends well" conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood!!! chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation.
