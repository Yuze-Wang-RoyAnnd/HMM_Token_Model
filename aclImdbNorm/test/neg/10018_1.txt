the best thing about "the prey" is the tag line..."it's not human and it's got an axe"! the movie itself is a padded stinkaroo....endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die! no slasher fan will like this garbage.....watch "friday the 13th" again and burn any copy of this film you find! <br /><br />it also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever made!
