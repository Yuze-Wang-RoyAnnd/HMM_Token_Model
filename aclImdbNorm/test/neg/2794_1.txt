do not take this film seriously, rent it with some folks who want to play mystery science 3000, and you will probably laugh your butts off. the evil guys are so not scary, it's funny, it's like some dude from 7th grade with a sickle in a scarecrow get up. the acting is hilarious. i love the occasional self torture with a poor horror film and this really had me giggling. i recommend it on that basis. of course recreational drugs will enhance the experience. oh, there is a naked group swimming scene, that will allow for some star dust on the 5 star system. the token black male gets injured badly, but continues his joking as well as using the injured body part quite readily throughout. enjoy this complete and utter disgrace to films.
