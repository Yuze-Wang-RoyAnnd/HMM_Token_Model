this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not the stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest. this is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. probably jim varney's worst movie ever. the last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for. on the other hand, if you are a die hard jim varney/ernest fan, then like me, you must add this film to your collection. it does have brief, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between. the mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collectors item and a must have for your ernest collection. i was lucky to find this film online at a dirt cheap price a couple years ago. i believe i paid 1.99 plus shipping for it. and it was the only copy i could find anywhere. even though this is a truly all around horrible movie, it is still a must have if you are a jim varney fan and an ernest movie collector such as i. on a scale of 1 to 10 i give this movie a 2 but thats only because i've never seen a 1 before ;)
