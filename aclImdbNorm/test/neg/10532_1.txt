every now and then some amateur will come out with a tired piece of action film making. this one is just so wrong i don't think i even need to comment about the plot, acting, script, camera work. because it have none!! if putting a muscle guy in cool leather jacket walking in slow-mo and throw in a funky rap song is the main ingredient of making a great action movie, then sayonara action movie!!
