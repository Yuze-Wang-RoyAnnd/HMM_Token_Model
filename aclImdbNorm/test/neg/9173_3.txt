what can i say...not much to this one at all. pretty dull and uninteresting.<br /><br />the actors performances are just ok. the only one that shines in any way is simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. i understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but i can't help but feel his talent was wasted. no one else rose above mediocre.<br /><br />the story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning, but then just doesn't go anywhere. there wasn't a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like i had just seen something special. the cinematography was fairly bland...i mean desert in a washed out sort of sepia...not very inspiring.<br /><br />the story of his childhood pal back outta prison seemed only partially thought out and didn't really add anything to the story, other than making an average 'twilight zone' script into a full length feature.<br /><br />drab.
