i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie, but this was so awful, i had to make an exception.<br /><br />i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like. there just wasn't anything here to like.<br /><br />i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student. but even considering that, the sets and effect are bad. the cinematography is mediocre, but may be the best part of the movie.<br /><br />the acting is bad. a sad state when the female voice-over for the computer is the best actor. the dialogue is bad. the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent.<br /><br />the humor is not just subtle and sublime; it's nowhere to be found. as an example, a whole 20 minutes, of the 80 minute film, is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator.<br /><br />this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's scifi to 2001. what we end up with though, is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's scifi c-movie. at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.
