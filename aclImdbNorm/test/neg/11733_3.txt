honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? obviously pretty hard! i was soooo excited to see this because i loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. well, i finally see it and i was sooo disapointed. ok, the shower scene was more realistic...that's why i gave it a 3. otherwise, it did suck. vince vaughn does a terrible job playing norman, he's just too dense or something. i don't know, it was just terrible. don't see it!
