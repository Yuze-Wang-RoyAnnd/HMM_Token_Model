this was terrible, mean-spirited, and full of the worst clich'es and racial stereotypes i've seen in a looong time. seeing hayden p trying to act "ghetto" was painful (hi, one pant leg up on yer sweats and some braids downs't make you "down with the homies"). solange knowles pretty much grimaces through the entire movie. most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes...what was up with the finale??? and poor rihanna was just plain exploited to get people to watch her "act", which she can't.<br /><br />put simply, this film downs't even deserve one star. please put this tired franchise to rest. or at least make the next one bring it on iv: cheerleaders vs. freddy & jason.
