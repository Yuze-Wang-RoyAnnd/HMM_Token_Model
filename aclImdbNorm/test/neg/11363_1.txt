this has to be the worst movie i've seen this year.. and i watch a lot of cable. the plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no start or ending of any scene.. it's just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. the "special effects" ( spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. i have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end. the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me.. i'm sorry for my bad english.. i am from romania ( and this is my first post ). i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just can't believe that this is a movie released in 2007.
