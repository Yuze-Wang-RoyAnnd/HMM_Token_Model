when na"ive young eddie hatch, a window dresser at savory's department store, falls for a statue of venus and gives her a chaste kiss, venus steps off her pedestal and gives eddie more than he bargained for. this creaking example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. the purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on ava gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. robert walker as eddie gets lost in a thankless role. eddie's not just naive, but dithering and hapless. gardner is gorgeous, but the only things that give the movie any life are olga san juan as eddie's loving but jealous girl friend, tom conway as the suave owner of savory's and eve arden as savory's long time, wise cracking secretary. it's a role arden could play in her sleep, and she's good at it. <br /><br />the musical opened on broadway in 1943 and made mary martin a big-time star. the only point of a musical, however, is to have music. since one touch of venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts, kurt weill, composing, and ogden nash writing the lyrics, came up with a series of stylish, witty songs and one masterpiece. without the satire, or the clever songs or martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death. <br /><br />not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the weill/nash songs, they brought in the movie's music director, ann ronell, to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived, turning sharp observation into lovey-dovey romance. ronell was no hack; she wrote willow weep for me. wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked ogden nash's clever work. <br /><br />the one bright spot in the movie is that weill/nash masterpiece. "speak low" is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote. it's given one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments by eileen wilson dubbing gardner. dick haymes contributes a chorus. <br /><br />as for ann ronell, she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director, as well as composer and lyric writer. yours for a song: the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business, including ronell, kay swift, dorothy fields and dana suess. and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill/nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast, you might be able to track down the cd, one touch of venus (1943 original cast) / lute song (1946 original cast). the music is paired with lute song, another broadway show that starred martin.
