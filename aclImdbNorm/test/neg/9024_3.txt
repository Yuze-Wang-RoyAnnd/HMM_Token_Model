the most die-hard worshippers of john wayne will cringe when they watch the lawless frontier. even for a poverty row studio, this one is one stinkeroo.<br /><br />unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime perpetrator. earl dwire plays a halfbreed white and indian who for reasons that are not explained, pretends he's a mexican, hokey accent and all. dwire sounds like the frito bandito of advertising fame back in the day.<br /><br />he and his gang happen upon gabby hayes and his daughter sheila terry. they really don't have anything worth robbing, but dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap terry and have his way with her. she hears the dastardly fate she has in store and she and hayes flee the ranch. <br /><br />where they happen to meet john wayne who's on the trail of the bandits. they also run into one very stupid sheriff who believes wayne is one of the bandits. again for reasons i can't quite fathom.<br /><br />it was a tough way to earn a living grinding out horse operas like these for the duke. fortunately better things were on the way.
