this film almost gave me a nervous breakdown. when i was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, i had just started teaching in secondary (high) school. the whole teaching business was all a bit nervewracking for a beginner, but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom i decided to watch some rather awful films. the flintstones was one of the films that i chose, and then i put "king of the streets" (the uk title of 'alien warrior') on. just before it finished i found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all...my life, the film stock, the lb2 i had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the blockbuster ex rental section, the time it must have taken to print the sleeve art, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as negligable as their efforts were)...the list goes on.<br /><br />i love bad films. let me make this perfectly clear - i love watching crappy films from blockbusters. me and my mate dan used to sit and watch many, many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them. but this was a different type of crappy film. i don't think that anything has come close to this, not even tobe hooper's "death trap" (which is probably my second worst film in the world). the whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me; the repetition of music at any available opportunity, regardless of on-screen events; the whole.... aaaggghhhhhhh!!!!! i can't even carry on with this 'critical' dissection, as my gag reflex has started. the futility of that film, even now, three years after i watched it for the first and last time, still renders me speechless (but i am still able to type). the whole "making a car from odd parts" section had me contemplating horrible things.<br /><br />i implore you, if you are interested in watching this film, just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back. i can almost guarantee that it won't be even half as bad as this film actually is. don't, under any circumstances, contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever. not if you are a christian and you want to see a christ allegory; not if you are a bad movie afictionado and you want to experience the true nadir of trash; not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute). make no mistake about it, this film is unholy. it is the antichrist in video form. as bo cattlett in get shorty said: "i've seen better film on teeth".
