this is easily one of the worst films i've seen in many years. i started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered....not much! in fact, it ended up delivering even less than i expected. my first reaction when i saw the opening portions of the film was that i would probably end up rating it a "4". i thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere.<br /><br />as the film progressed however, the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and repugnant near the end. by the time the movie was over, i was willing to rate it no more than a "1". <br /><br />don't waste your time or money on this one.
