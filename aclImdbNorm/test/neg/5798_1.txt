i can laugh at just about anything, but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bomb!!!!i honestly watched this movie from beginning to end, and did not even crack a smile. i am shocked that sandler, schneider, spade etc., would put their names on this piece of crap. worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players. what more can i say? how could such tasteless, extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent!! maybe i have lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but i cannot remember a movie that i have disliked this much in a long time. what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back.
