incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane, leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path... i know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min' one that i watched - but i can't fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck!<br /><br />i'd heard for long about the alleged "shocking" content of sex/nudity (which honestly there isn't much of here at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - it's the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here: everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project! camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? are they in- or outside? have they changed scenes? who is, or is meant to be in the shot? editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it's tragic.<br /><br />a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and fellini-like) turkey that's only good for a few gobble-laughs and peter o'toole, who makes a most memorable tiberius. oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. i'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask: who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this? there, i've wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time - period!<br /><br />1 out of 10 from ozjeppe
