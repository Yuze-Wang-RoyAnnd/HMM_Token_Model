just saw this movie yesterday night and i almost cried. no, it wasn't because it got me utterly petrified, no. it was absolutely horrendous! sometimes, you see movies that make you wonder what will become of the human race in the near future - this movie is one of those. it's as though the writer, actors, director, et al, just came together and copied and pasted scenes of their favorite horror flicks, zipped it all together and said "hey, here's satan's whip!!!" after seeing this movie, i could not help but be tormented by the sight of people whom call themselves "actors"; waltzing around like they're some kind of talented artistic interpreters... do not be fooled they suck! don't bother wasting your time or money!!!
