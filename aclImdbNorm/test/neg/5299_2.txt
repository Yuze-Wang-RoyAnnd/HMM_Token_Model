"get shorty", "out of sight", "jackie brown" (and even "52 pick-up")--folks were finally getting elmore leonard right, making good movies out of his work. so, despite my students' warnings about how bad this movie would be, i couldn't resist renting it. i thought, how bad can it be? oy, what a mistake, especially right on the heels of reading the book, which was lame (and too circularly self-referential, too) relative to the rest of elmore leonard's books. still, the book was better than the movie. leonard again trumps the weak and unskilled screen-writers who try to take over his book. the dialogue written for steven tyler was painful to watch. and the lyrics to the character linda moon's first song? my middle-schoolers write with more depth. sad, sad, sad. why even give it a star? because harvey keitel and uma thurman are still fun to see on screen, and andre 3000 didn't make a complete fool of himself.
