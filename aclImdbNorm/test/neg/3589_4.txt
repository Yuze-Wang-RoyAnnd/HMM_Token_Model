i know, it's a movie. but when it comes to portray real life (in any matter) it should be as faithful as possible. i'm sorry, but "el misterio gal'indez" isn't as accurate as it seems. nor is the dominican republic depicted as it really is. in fact, it shocked me to see that the filming location for santo domingo was actually cuba. and incredibly enough, movies with cuban themes (havana, the lost city, bitter sugar, the godfather part ii) were actually filmed in santo domingo! so what happened here? why did they shoot the movie in cuba instead of the d.r.? the spanish dialogs with the cuban accent are horrible! those are not dominicans! on the historic level, gal'indez would have never been hanged. he might as well been shot, decapitated or died from the inhumane torture he'd been receiving. then, thrown his body in the caribbean sea. but trujillo would have never ordered death by strangulation. his sick mind wouldn't have allowed it.<br /><br />acting isn't delivered as expected. harvey keitel looks like he's just expecting a paycheck. i prefer the leading actress in "deep blue sea". the rest of the cast would have been excellent in some cuban movie, and the same goes for the selected shooting location.<br /><br />i suggest "la fiesta del chivo" (the feast of the goat), from bestselling author mario vargas llosa, directed by his cousin luis llosa. it's a bit more realistic with dominican history. the trujillo character is very well portrayed, and the galindez incident is treated very briefly in this movie.
