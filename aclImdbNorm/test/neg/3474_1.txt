perhaps, we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen. perhaps, we expect too much from these films. however, if we, as viewers, are offered far too little, what happens then? <br /><br />that is what i thought after seeing imperium - nerone by paul marcus, a part of the production series on the roman empire. augustus by roger young, the first imperium movie, included at least peter o'toole but what does this movie include?<br /><br />hardly anything accurate. the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history. throughout the movie, we see nero young: young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula, young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own (historically 14 year long) reign. and...he dies the same. according to the movie, nero, born during the reign of tiberius, lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies... continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie, which makes it hardly logical, not to say reliable. nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. at that time, his mother, agrippina, is exiled by caligula. later, however, she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him messalina. at these moments of the movie, we see acte (rike schmid), nero's mistress. all right, it is historically "accurate"; yet, no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome. in the film, she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul's miracle (he brings a young girl marzia back to life). besides, there was, historically, nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligula's 4 year long reign (a.d. 37-41). i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! and many, many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film, i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy.<br /><br />as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment, they are equally lame as the history here is. the performances are artificial, the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. perhaps, i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead, but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all. he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor. is he an artist who burns rome for a song? is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives? is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of "alleged justice"? none of these. he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and, in the long run, begins to release the fire burning within himself... john simm is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character. elisa tovati is only sexy as poppaea; yet she could have been much much better. the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze. low budget results in low effects and, consequently, low entertainment.<br /><br />but what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, i give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:<br /><br />- the death of poppaea and st paul's talk with nero at her dead body, <br /><br />- claudius' mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered britannia while messalina was his wife much before his death), <br /><br />- tigellinus killing agrippina (laura morante), nero's mother, <br /><br />- nero's arguments in the speech to the senators, <br /><br />- finally, nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by acte "let us forgive him"<br /><br />all in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire. it's better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been made at all.
