another example of the women-in-prison genre. this is not exactly a genre known for quality films, but this is a notch below most. a bunch of women are taken from the bordellos where they work to a prison on a rocky island. once there, they are subjected to lots of poorly directed sex and atrocious "dialog." for a film with an astounding amount of sex and nudity there is really nothing erotic about any of it. the sex scenes are awkwardly acted, and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to drag on and on. that said, there are at least some minimal production values. on the w-i-p scale i would put it above frauen fur zellenblock neun, but below chained heat.
