humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of the wog boy seemed to enjoy it more than i did. i found it an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. the boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between lucy bell and nick giannopoulos while i found laughs thin on the ground. if you want to spend your money on this, wait until it's on video.
