"how many ppl know about this?"..."lets keep it that way!" i wonder at least some new dialogues can be made or not? the movie is a real poor copy of the original. bruce willis probably did this movie while he was half asleep. the way he looks at richard gere's face with his cold-blooded stare when they meet near the port...oh my god! scared the hell out of me. why does he kill major koslova and her mates isn't still clear to me. another thing that i could not understand was the poison solution that he put on the car (what in the world was it?).<br /><br />the movie plot is haywire and climax is dull. another funny thing was how the russian was killed in the club. i fell off my chair laughing when i saw that scene. also, what was that thing about the gay guy..what purpose was it serving. i think the movie is made too swift to be easily understood. you have to really think what the hell was on director's mind. lol.<br /><br />and the best scene after all was richard gere trying to hold on to the pillar between 2 fast moving trains. must have made someone loose his head if not contact with the pillar.
