an example of all of the worst gay stereotypes all in one movie.<br /><br />and charles, why do you speak in that weird pseudo british/high-brow accent, and insist that the kid speak that way too? did anyone else notice that all of the soundtrack music is exactly the same? you should stick with the good old hollywood camp drag stuff that you are so good at! die mommy die ii, the sequel!! i don't see the value of spending time and money on a project like this; there are so many real life gay youth stories to be told and we should be seeing those, not this garbage. sheesh, what a waste of time. embarrassing example of gay cinema.
