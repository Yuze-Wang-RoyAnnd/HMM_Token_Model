first off... i have to say acting isn't very good. miranda cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly. spencer, her brother is a way much better actor. spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act. carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but... sorry, it just isn't good. sam doesn't even get credit, i mean come on... icarly... pretty self centered eh? freddy isn't bad, i don't have a comment. i must add that carly and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast, they go shouting out all their lines.it's sorta bad influence in a way because carly has a web show and if kids will copy this, they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe.<br /><br />the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining. at least this show isn't boring, it has nice plots, pretty strong. many kids will like this because they don't look for flaws.<br /><br />overall this is a bad show but it's not boring.
