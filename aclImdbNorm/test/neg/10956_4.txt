this is a entertaingly bad b-movie. actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies. it had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and i have seen worse acting. the zombies were great, clearly these were romero zombies, and was really a interesting zombie story. obviously not oscar material, and if your not into zombie movies, or b-movies you probably wont enjoy this, but if you are you'll like this movie.<br /><br />the main clint eastwood knockoff western character guy is pretty good, although they never really clearly explain how he can heal himself from gunshots and zombie bites. but if he has more than a line of dialogue that where his bad acting is really evident.<br /><br />it was a good ending to, at least i thought so. romero should be flattered if he ever saw this.
