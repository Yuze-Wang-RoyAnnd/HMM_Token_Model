the film disappointed me for many reasons: first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well-built but did only feature a marginal role. then, the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation. the middle-eastern setting, man with family meets new girl overseas, karaoke bar, the camera movements and the imagery - all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility. this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film!? the female main actress is awful - did she play the precog in minority report? and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes. r-rated just for this? this movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore!
