i've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. i'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that noah's ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! don't the executives at nbc have any class? i feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini-series. the script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, totally inaccurate! i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes, but this film changed just about everything in the story. god himself is going to go through the trouble to kill off the entire earth's population, but he somehow misses one guy that's sailing around trying to sell stuff to noah. give me a break! and what was up with noah's sons acting like indiana jones, saving girls in distress? if all that isn't bad enough, there's the part where god apologizes to noah and says "i'm sorry noah, i was wrong". newsflash nbc, god can not be wrong! this film is the most tasteless and disgraceful biblical film ever made.
