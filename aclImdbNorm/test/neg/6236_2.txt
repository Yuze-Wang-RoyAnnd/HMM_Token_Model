business executive is kidnapped, made to wander miles and miles in a woodland for days and days exchanging dialog with his kidnapper.and we have got to listen to all the nonsense......<br /><br />meanwhile his snotty wife and family are at home with the fbi wondering what to do...... .....at no time does she seem concerned about the fate of her husband except when it comes to the ransom..... a "love story"? give me a break!<br /><br />the plot is ludicrous. and almost every scene is filled with an air of expectation that something significant is going to happen but it never does.<br /><br />the result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more silly when we learn the fate of the kidnapper.<br /><br />this is garbage:<br /><br />2 out of 10.
