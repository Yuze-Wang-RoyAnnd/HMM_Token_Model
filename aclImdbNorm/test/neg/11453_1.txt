the selection of the bloated, boring, and racist "cimarron" ranks as the worst choice for best picture in oscar history. poorly acted (particularly by the justly forgotten richard dix, whose performance as the self-centered and irresponsible yancey cravat ranks as one of the most narcissistic characterizations in screen history) and leadenly paced, the film is truly shocking today because of the racist slant towards its one black character, who is introduced by being shown sleeping in a chandelier.<br /><br />other comments by imdb reviewers have dismissed the attitude towards this character as being merely dated, but many films that appeared during this period did not depict blacks as shuffling, lazy mental deficients in the manner that this behemoth takes great delight in; so that argument seems weak to say the least. but whether you regard this demeaning characterization as in shockingly bad taste for anyone at any time or merely the forgivable ignorance of a less-educated era, it is very painful to watch with 21st century eyes.<br /><br />but even this might not matter if the film weren't the overlong bore that it is. voted the best picture oscar at the 1930/31 academy awards when such enduring classics as "city lights," "the public enemy," "dracula," "the dawn patrol" and "the blue angel" failed to be nominated, "cimarron" is by far the worst selection to join the oscar pantheon.
