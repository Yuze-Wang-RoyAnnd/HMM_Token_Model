there are just so many things wrong with this movie.<br /><br />jeff bridges weird accent.<br /><br />rita's ability to crack the password code <br /><br />the entire script <br /><br />the ending - esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for jeff and rita and the publisher. j & r laugh and say "we don;t drink coffee anymore". well, why did they order it then??? they obviously did. if they didn't and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffees.<br /><br />total tosh.
