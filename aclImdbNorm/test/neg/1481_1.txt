a trash classic! basically what we have here is a story about a couple of american teenagers (one male, one female both beautiful people of course) who seem to be psychically linked, in that every time both of them fall asleep, they can inhabit each others dreams and express each others innermost desires... think mills & boon meets x-files and you'll be somewhere near the mark. actually, its more like an unhappy hybrid between one of ed wood's famously bad b- movies and a particularly silly episode of melrose place, so tacky are the special-effects and so amateurish is the acting. the actors who inhabit (i wouldn't say act in) this flick say their lines like they're reading from cue cards and pout when they're supposed to be showing an emotion, and it comes as no great shock (or loss to the industry) that they have since faded into obscurity. the whole thing is just a laughably misguided mixture of styles that don't go together at all, and the end result is a intriguing curiosity that no doubt will be lapped up by purveyors of so-bad-they're-good films in years to come. i'll probably be the only person who ever comments on this film, but if you are reading and have seen it please get back, it gets kinda lonely round here...
