young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? everything. even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. the audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. how many thousands of times has this been done on television? bad cops frame good cops. again, how many times? there was not an original shred in this entire concoction. giovanni ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script, drawing the only laughs of the entire movie. and the thought of he and claire danes working from a real script with a grown-up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me. note to screenwriters: buy one of those story generators. it can't possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television. note to auteur: there are shots available to you other than closeups. even the lovely and interesting face of claire danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup. note to cinematographer: apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years--you have much to learn. note to color timer at the lab: at least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don't know what they're talking about. note to claire: i hope this paid for your new condo. it's time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on.
