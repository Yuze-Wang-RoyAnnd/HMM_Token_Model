when this series aired i watched most of it. i think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of "the fugitive" and "the incredible hulk" where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. in this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. i liked what i saw of these shows. the acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. problem is: they cancelled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or i missed the last episodes).<br /><br />they never got a chance to wrap up the story either, knowing it had been cancelled. poof it was just gone. however, like i said before i might have missed the last episodes. but my proof to the contrary is this: i rented the tape. where i left off in the series. the lead character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving king's famous organization the shop. while getting away hero is kidnapped. it ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the shop. the end. last episode. on the video: his wife does not die but escapes the fire with him. right when he should get nabbed by the shop, he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence. abrupt, silly and cheap to the extreme. they just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was. they might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. almost pythonesque.<br /><br />the show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the david bowie song of the same name
