as other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie (keeping it kid friendly) fx was low class, they should of spent the $1 on a coke. as is typical with these d movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead. hope the money was worth it for boxleitner, really really big step down from babylon 5. nice to see what happened to buck rogers but damn this was low even for him. ' it was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also. don't watch.<br /><br />*****warning spoiler below****<br /><br />this thing chased down everyone it was after and yet boxlietner got away... that was pure bs. and the ending? how in the hell did the kids end up right there with him? that was just too much stupidity.
