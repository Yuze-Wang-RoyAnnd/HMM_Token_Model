inglourious basterds is tarantino's worst film he has ever made. it's full of his usual ingredient's i.e. snappy dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feel's deja-vu. the directing is typical tarantino and nothing seem's new at all. it's almost as if he's copied exactly from his only masterpiece, pulp fiction. <br /><br />there is nothing new or exciting about inglourious basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that isn't funny, nor brilliant as pulp fiction was. basterds supposedly is tarantino's tribute to leone's spaghetti western's but seem's mis-jointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub-titles and throw's the audience of balance.
