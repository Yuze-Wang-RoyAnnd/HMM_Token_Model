hulk hogan and zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal i'll never know why. if not for vince mcmahon's money this stupid film would have never been made. maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling. no holds barred is not that movie.
