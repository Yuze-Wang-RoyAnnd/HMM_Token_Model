the movie starts good, it has a thing going for it. about 1/3 into the movie things go downhill. carrey starts obsessing about the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. so what? thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls.<br /><br />the acting by whoever is playing his son is bad. from the get-go, as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession, he jumps on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it. totally unbelievable. i hope i never see this kid in another movie again.<br /><br />its a waste of time watching this movie. grab another. boring piece of ... well. the number is killing him? give me a break. i won't spoil the ending for you, but let's just say it is equally disappointing.<br /><br />3 / 10.
