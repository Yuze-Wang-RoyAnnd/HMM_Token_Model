i hated it. i hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art. this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid. after the first half hour, i fastfowarded through the dvd version, and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over. i became angered that i had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap. tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art.
