boring, utterly predictable soap opera. mary tyler moore is married to ted danson who's having an affair with christine lahti. moore is friends with lahti and doesn't know about the cheating. danson dies in an accident and lahti is pregnant with his baby. yawn! <br /><br />i'm ashamed to admit i paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986. i liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldn't pull this off. i constantly knew what was going to happen. like another poster said--this plays like a pg-rated lifetime movie.<br /><br />it does have lahti swearing nonstop at one point and even moore lets loose once! also there's a pointless shots of topless women playing football (!!!). other than that it's tv friendly. the only good thing about this was timothy gibbs playing moore and danson's teenage son. very handsome and quite a good actor. that aside there's nothing to recommend this. you've seen it before...and done better. it's obviously been forgotten. skip it.
