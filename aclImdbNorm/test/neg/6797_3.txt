this was an abysmal show. in short it was about this kid called doug who guilt-tripped a lot. seriously he could feel guilty over killing a fly then feeling guilty over feeling guilty for killing the fly and so forth. the animation was grating and unpleasant and the jokes cheap. <br /><br />it aired here in sweden as a part of the "disney time" show and i remember liking it some what but then i turned 13.<br /><br />i never got why some of the characters were green and purple too. what was up with that? <br /><br />truly a horrible show. appareantly it spawned a movie which i've never seen but i don't have any great expectations for that one either.
