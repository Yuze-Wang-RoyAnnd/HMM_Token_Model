lance henriksen got paid something to appear in this. i hope it was a lot.<br /><br />former us national champion gymnast, kristie phillips starts as charlie case, a gymnast-turn-secret-agent (because it's very common that munchkin gymnasts become government spies...)<br /><br />there's a truly hysterical opening scene where charlie's uneven bars routine is sabotaged by an eastern-bloc competitor. what follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes i've ever witnessed....and they want you to take it seriously! don't worry...she sticks her dismount.<br /><br />everything after that is just a messy, dreck of a spy movie. watch the first fifteen minutes for the campy-gymnastics stuff, then run for cover.
