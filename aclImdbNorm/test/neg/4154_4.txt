an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition. seeing as terrence malick produced this, i expected something haunting and lyrical. instead, we get a typical norwegian co-production ("revolution" with al pacino, anyone?), where - quite possibly - good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay, and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. the "me-tarzan-you-jane" english dialogue between the non-english-speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy
