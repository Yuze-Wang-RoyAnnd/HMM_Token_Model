if you decide to watch wild rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. if you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, wild rebels is the wrong movie. if you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the american educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, wild rebels is the wrong movie. if you're looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well-financed, well-organized gang, wild rebels is the wrong movie. but if you're looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after scene of unintentional humor, horrendous acting, a paper-thin plot, and community theater style production values, wild rebels is the right movie.<br /><br />wild rebels is the story of a down-on-his-luck stock-car driver named rod tillman (steve alaimo). after a fiery crash (which rod walks away from completely unscathed despite having only a cotton pants and a london fog style jacket for protection), rod decides to give it up. with no plan for his future other than to wander aimless through the back-roads of the south, he stumbles on the satan's angels motorcycle gang (a gang being three of the stupidest guys to ever zip up a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share). this group of hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural town in florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. these bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some larger crimes they have planned. apparently, these three einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. so they recruit rod to perform feats of daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be capable of like keeping the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low-speed chase. eventually, they hold-up a bank, get into the aforementioned low-speed chase, and have the lamest gun battle with the police ever put on film. i could go on forever, but you get the idea.<br /><br />i hate the term "so bad it's good", but that seems to aptly describe wild rebels.
