well, in all honesty it's beyond the boundaries of stupid, but "killer pussy" is still one insanely entertaining little flick. no plot, tons of oiled up cha-chas, cheesy effects, and a penis eating monster! what's not to love?! pretty much - a couple of explorers find this creature that likes to nestle itself within a woman's beef curtains until a schwang is unfortunately... ah, thrust into its mouth. it finds it's host who is later discovered frozen in a deserted house by a group of moronic guys and their equally brainless, slut girlfriends whose van breaks down. the creature jumps from each girl as they all fornicate like drunken rabbits... there's some cheap gore, girl-on-girl "blood wrestling", ky jelly vomit, sock-puppet monsters and lots of soft-core sex. ridiculous but a cool waste of time...
