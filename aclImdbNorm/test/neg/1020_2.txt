he's the only reason to see this film. he gives a very good performance--much better than this crap deserves. he's very handsome and very talented--he deserves better than this. also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this. he's another talented actor who deserves better but, like esai, he gives a very good performance. so, if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch. otherwise, stay away. one more complaint--couldn't we have had more scenes of esai shirtless?
