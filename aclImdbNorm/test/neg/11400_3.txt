as a fan of author gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which ik ook van jou is not the best one), i was looking forward to see this film. i didn't catch it in cinema though, and after seeing it on to tv i'm terribly happy i resisted buying it on video. out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in dutch film history. all the good parts have been left out, the story is changed, not to its benefits. all humour has been cut out. what's left is a bad-acted, over dramatic, non-consistent film that i do not want to watch again ever.<br /><br />i condolate giphart with this result, and am happy that robbert jan westdijk did a hell of a better job on giphart's topper phileine zegt sorry. go see that one!
