just re-saw this last night and to put it bluntly: "style instead of substance". we can already guess that there had to be a lot more to jerry lee lewis than what is depicted here. the jerry lee lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real human being for one minute throughout the entire hour and a half plus running time, but then again, all the other characters are only one pencil-stroke from being total cartoon characters.<br /><br />let's take the beginning. we see jerry lee and his cousin, jimmy swaggart sneaking over to the black jazz club and we see jerry getting his inspiration. might be possible. we see how the two cousins choose different paths in life (also possible). then we cut to jerry lee playing the piano as an adult (now played by dennis quaid) and it's thrilling and a little scary. cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, myra. from then on the whole thing turns into a recap of certain events played out in a style befitting a news reel on high speed.<br /><br />not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that made jerry lee. alec baldwin as jimmy swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greater successes in the years to come. winona ryder as myra is the most one noty character in the film. she teases, she sobs, she chews gum and play coquettish and that's about it. there is never for a minute given a reason why she ended up being the third mrs. lewis and speaking of wives, where are the first two? that is why this really can't be classified as a biopic, but more of a inaccurate news reel. we see jerry get his first song played on the radio, we see his second single going into the top ten, we see his third go to no. 1 and so on. then comes the inevitable downfall. absolutely, no basis in reality.<br /><br />to conclude another minor quarrel: the movie takes place from '56 to '58 and still myra says: "i am only 13" right up till the end.
