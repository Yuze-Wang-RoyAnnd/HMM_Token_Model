i've expected a comedy about the nva, but this is a parody. it shows the national army of eastern germany in a light that is not appropriate, and definitely not true.<br /><br />one can make a comedy about everything, as long as the underlying facts are not changed. even a comedy about the german kz is possible, as roberto benigni with "life is beautiful" has shown.<br /><br />the movie nva would be an "ok" comedy, because the jokes in it are overall ok. nothing special - not hilarious, but enough to live with it.<br /><br />the point is, that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the nva. a death machine that was ready to attack western europe along with it's friend the red army. an institution that used everything to get the utmost from it's soldiers. an army that marched into the cspr in 1968, and was ready to march also in poland to destroy the solidarnosc. you can't make a movie without showing the tiniest bit of evil, or would you make a parody about a kz,guantanamo or 9/11??? showing osama bin laden as a funny screwed guy? 90 minutes about a funny osama in a afghan taliban camp, where he makes jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the nva!
