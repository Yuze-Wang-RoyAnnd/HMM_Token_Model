max cash a charter boat captain who works off the caribbean island san sebastian is hired by sarah, who's looking for legendary boat, el diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. but something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew anything about it are being killed.<br /><br />i have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. instead what we ended up with was a low-rent, b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'the deep', but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. the story is a tame muddle (so many inconsistent angles don't make a lick of sense and encourages a blotchy pace) and the technical side is clunky. nice exotic location and under-water photography though. while the carefree performances weren't too bad either. a gruff wayne crawford is enjoyably witty and june chadwick is fair along side him. sheri able is pretty much eye candy. there are some bizarre developments that amuse and one or two eerie sequences. however there's a real lack of cohesion. most of the cutaway deaths happen off-screen, except for the bloody, fitful opening kills done by something unseen. again just another thing that leaves you high and dry. the music is generic with its thumping cues to warn us of approaching danger and the pov shots get a good working out. tatty, but watchable.
