did we all see the same movie??? i can't believe the raves some of the others are giving this really awful bio which, believe or not, was authorized by shirley temple herself, based on her book child star. gives me the feeling that some are awfully easy to please.<br /><br />first of all, ashley rose orr, whatever her modest talents are, in no way, shape or form even resembles shirley temple enough to be cast as her in this sort of straightforward biography of the world's most famous child star. she gives no indication of why or how this child was so revered except for trying her hardest to do a shirley impersonation which never clicks on any level. none whatsoever.<br /><br />and that is the major handicap of the whole piece. but as if that isn't bad enough, any drama inherent in shirley's story of her climb to almost overnight stardom has been completely white-washed with insipid writing peppered with occasional song and dance moments that don't even approximate what shirley did (as for example, "the codfish ball" with buddy ebsen which was probably the high point of shirley's choreographed dance routines).<br /><br />simply putting a girl in a polka dot dress doesn't make her shirley temple. none of shirley's own brand of charm, warmth and appeal is even remotely suggested. all we see on display is a pale imitation of the original proving, once and for all, that there was only one shirley temple.<br /><br />it's worthless to write anything further about this mess. none of the others are more than ordinary in lifeless roles. my advice for shirley's fans is to read her book--or better still--watch her movies.<br /><br />this is the pits.
