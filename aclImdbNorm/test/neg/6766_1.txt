yes.a real stinker. i saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me that this is a great "psychological" movie. this film makes every effort not to be understandable. i was aware that i was in for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutes.i waited since i expected to see something valuable, and most important of all, i paid for this film. the wait was unbearable. after seeing the film, i talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments ( they call themselves under this title ) of turkey this "movie" had recognised as a masterpiece. yes, a masterpiece, but in the category of stinkers.i think that a movie must be self-explanatory. this film is just the opposite. keep away from this thing which calls itself a "movie". burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". rate: 1 out of 10
