during production, this lwt series was titled 'rocket to the moon', a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough. then word came through that it had been retitled 'reach for the moon', as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. this same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series, and the same tired and boring love-triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes! any television program that decides to use the 'love-triangle' storyline for even a single episode is pushing it, but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable. there are reasons to watch however, with the scenery of the isle of wight certainly providing a beautiful setting, and the seemingly effortless performance of lynda bellingham hitting all the right comedy marks. this, however is not enough. a number of performances are noticeable , especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which jonathan kerrigan refers to as his face. i have already mentioned lynda bellingham in the role of 'fussy mother' (yes, thats as far as character development and back-story goes), but i was impressed by the actor maurice roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast, having appeared in everything from classic movies such as richard attenborough's 'oh what a lovely war', and 'the eagle has landed', and tv including baywatch, holby city, the bill, eastenders, cheers, doctor who in the 80s, star trek, and even going to hollywood with sylvestor stallone in 1995s judge dredd) whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers i have met - often incapable men, whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak. it is refreshing to see that roeves is still getting work, having also appeared in the 1998 british film 'the acid house' and even more recently alongside the wonderful maria bello and sean bean in 'the dark'. the standout reason to watch this series, even though his appearances are very few. another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program, is ben miles, in the role of the sex-mad 'typical man' brother (once again, what an original character!). as with roeves, the cv says it all. after elevating this, miles has since appeared in the hollywood movie 'v for vendetta', and the 2001 star studded film 'the affair of the necklace', alongside brian cox, adrien brody, christopher walken and jonathan pryce. unfortunately the fairly capable actors i have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is kerrigan and saira todd, both of whom seem to have been in casualty for too long, and haven't yet learned to act. even the tolerable frances grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the lasting memory i have of her from the set, is of the ad asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take, she subconsciously 'pulled her knickers out of her crack!'. familiar faces appear in each episode - child actors from cbbc programs, and dramas such as '2 point 4 children', and other regulars from commercials such as mr ben's ("they'll remember me for this"), lynda 'the oxo lady' bellingham, and others that i don't even want to remember. each episode halfheartedly tries to 'deal with issues' such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive pupils, and rocket building(!)... things that grange hill was doing better when my parents were young! overall, this series was a disappointment, and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series. unfortunately, for them they took the easy route, both in the writing and (for the most part) in the casting. i would recommend both 'waterloo road' and 'the street',to fans of good drama - the latter in particular which managed to achieve this. if you like the isle of wight, don't 'reach for the moon', reach for the holiday brochure instead - it probably contains more character development!
