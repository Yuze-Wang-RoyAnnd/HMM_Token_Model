i've seen some bad things in my time. a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud; a head on collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor; human beings living like animals.<br /><br />but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat.<br /><br />this film is worse than 911, worse than hitler, worse than vllad the impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwaves.<br /><br />it is the most disturbing film of all time, easy.<br /><br />i used to think it was a joke, some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something.<br /><br />i shudder
