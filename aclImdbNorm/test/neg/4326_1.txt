look, some film has got to the be worst ever. i suggest it may be india song. when i saw the film in 1976 it was playing at the carnegie hall cinema, a place frequented by people who care a lot about film. from about the halfway point, people were simply flooding out of the theater. my girlfriend wouldn't let us leave, but by the end, the theater was virtually empty. i kept telling people as they left that "the good part is still to come." and it was. the good part was the screen at the end that said "fin." it was the only good part. i am still annoyed by this film 24 years later. it was pointless, stupid and derivative (marienbad, part 2). see it only if you want to spend an endless two hours learning to distinguish between merely bad and simply awful.
