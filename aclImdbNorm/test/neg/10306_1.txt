i am very open minded. i watch all kinds of programs to the end...good or bad...just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones. this show had potential to be good. but my god, what were the writers, casting director, and director thinking? the cast of actors are terrible...with the slightest exception of meryl (mimi rogers), and darcy (joy osmanski) being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot.<br /><br />the rest of the cast kill the show. it is the same story line in every episode. sam has plans to do something. his boss disrupts these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects. then the foolish ways sam tries to accommodate both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor. this is every episode. it gets very tiring.<br /><br />season 2, they ditch the eye candy. the 2 "hot" girls in the show get written out (yet the brother stays? explain that casting cut to me please). i can see why they wrote them out...they had no substantial role...but they didn't add anyone better to replace them.<br /><br />the cocky derek tricolli character is given a continuous appearance in season 2. his acting (along with everyone else's) resembles many poor sitcoms from the 80's...might have been funny then...but painful now.<br /><br />the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to execute them. this show lacks everything. production quality is the only good aspect of the show. it is great in that regard...unfortunately the content is painfully sad.<br /><br />my god. fox, was there really nothing better to choose from? i'm sticking with shows like "it's always sunny in philadelphia" or "30 rock" for now. the bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and aren't continually drooling on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe.
