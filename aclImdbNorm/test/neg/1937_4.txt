reading the other user comments, the review by a666333 has articulated most of what i was feeling throughout this film- predictable storyline, clich'e versions of lesbians/heterosexuals (i.e. straight woman becomes a lesbian while concluding that her husband is abusive and aggressive). <br /><br />also, the score was severely disappointing. it was bland, soft, sentimental elevator music- another common clich'e in movies about lesbians. the movie would have had a few interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music.<br /><br />a few scenes concerning sex and eroticism also struck me as attempts to titillate and raise shock value, including parts of the final performance scene. the conventional "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as the overly sentimental score. for example during the pool scene, the women are kissing, and then the camera pans along the abandoned wine glass, the flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft crashing of waves.<br /><br />the only elements i liked were the costuming and arobatics. they are well-choreographed, and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes. i genuinely smiled during those, and during the last scene with the police officer. but they were not enough to balance out the negatives or make me enjoy this film.
