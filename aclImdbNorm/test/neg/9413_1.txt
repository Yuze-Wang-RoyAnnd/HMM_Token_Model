i am usually a big fan of pacino (scarface, serpico, devils advocate) but since scent of a woman he pretty much plays the same role and shouts a lot. this movie had no endearing characters to warm to. brandon played by bongo mcconnahey is the least likable of the bunch. he nowhere even approached a real human being. pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness how old is renee russo? the only high light of this wretched mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has like 10 lines total. even the usually reliable jeremy piven was utterly unlikeable.<br /><br />note to writers of movies, they do not usually work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit likable (noteable exception scarface). as the movie closes and old brandon is at the airport my only thought was, please let a plane crash into the airport and kill brandon.
