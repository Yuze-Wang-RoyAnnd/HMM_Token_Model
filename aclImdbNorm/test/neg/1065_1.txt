this film is so copy-cat, clich'e-ridden, clumsy, and laboured, i find it astounding that anyone could not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. <br /><br />here is the range of idiotic clich'es, ridiculous psychologising, and simply unfeasible storytelling in this "hard hitting" representation of high school: the tough guy jock is really a homosexual. the a-student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this causes him to commit incest. a teacher is mean to a student who wets his pants in class. a girl who is going out with the above-mentioned jock is really in love with him and "just wants a family".<br /><br />maybe the only saving grace is the student counsellor scenes which are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this film are so leaden that it beggars belief. <br /><br />this film shows me no insight into teenagers and i will not be surprised when it bombs, especially with teenagers. the people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers, and boy are they barking up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with "understanding" teen issues. i mean, what is the moral of this film? "hey guys, let's all look out for each other and hug each other" give me a break. anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14 year old with that kind of message needs to think back. in the 1980s we were watching kentucky fried movie, xtro, porky's, evil dead, terminator, etc. this film will fall on deaf ears. <br /><br />2:37 is right up there with another australian "indepedent" film, 'one perfect day,' which was as bad as this utter turkey of a film. thank god no taxpayers money was spent on this boloney.<br /><br />avoid!!!!
