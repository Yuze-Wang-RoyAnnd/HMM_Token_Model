i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and utter rubbish. akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than paris at night?). the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to egon schiele's angst ridden self portraits. yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. what is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish. the only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good goddard and truffaut really are.
