i'm a big time horror fan, and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards. well, let me tell you i don't know whom was giving it all the hype, but let me speak on a few things.<br /><br />first of all this film is "not" a lot of things. it is not scary, not suspenseful, not overly gory, not overly sick (except for one season maybe) not beautifully scored.... at all.<br /><br />the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in greece because they have done a little naughtiness in london. we don't even know what they did, but it is presumed that they killed someone. <br /><br />**spoiler alert**<br /><br />the male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of "cleansing the island of perverts" oddly enough. the killings are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects suck.<br /><br />there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning, but even that is done without any care for how it is shot. <br /><br />end of spoilers<br /><br />the end of the movie is about the only thing that isn't totally predictable. i especially enjoyed when the "herder" farts on the husband. anyway, if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead. it's nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread.<br /><br />3/10
