martin lawrence is not a funny man i runteldat. he just has too much on his mind and he is too mad which trips his puns pretty early in the game. he tries to make fun of critics, which boils down to "f*** them". then he goes on to rather primitive sexual jokes on smokers with throat cancer and it just goes downhill from there. 3/10
