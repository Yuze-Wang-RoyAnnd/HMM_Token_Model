where to begin? this film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, however, if you live outside the us and do follow the game, it is laughable. various rugby traditions such as the "haka" which is preformed by the new zealand "all blacks" and only by the all blacks. the leader of the haka is usually the member of the team with the best maori pedigree. this is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. the film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over-all execution that lets it down, heavily. taking into account is is based on a real story, it does posses a great deal of clich'es in the storyline. i would strongly suggest that any american interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is.
