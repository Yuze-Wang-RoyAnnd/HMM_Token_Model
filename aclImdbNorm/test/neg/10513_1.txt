a dark, yet humorous tale involving a cop who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings.most of the film contained questionable acting,plot, props, and filming. the fight scenes were as hokey as a middle schooler's rendition of a wwii battle. the lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no motivation for being there. the props were bad because they did not even look like they could function in the slightest amount. the majority of the film appeared to be shot in someones basement (in some scenes you could see the rafters overhead in a scene that was not supposed to look like that of a basement). the plot had no motivation to move forward or go backwards, it just appeared to stand still at times with no reason for some characters actions. i felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series. it is similar to the movie blade, in that he is an african american vampire hunter. however, that is where all similarities end, and the movie looks closer to a saturday night live spoof.
