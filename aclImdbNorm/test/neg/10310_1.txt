oh boy! oh boy! on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra bullock and her name written on top. i think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties, was because of sandra bullock's name. bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. rest of the movie
