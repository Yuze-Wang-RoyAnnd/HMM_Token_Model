this *should* have been an amazingly funny movie...but it falls flat on its face. (in fact, i stopped watching it halfway through, which is something i rarely do...) -- bill murray plays jack corcoran, a second-rate motivational speaker who is bequeathed an elephant by his father (whom he had presumed to be dead before he was born) ; he then has one week to get the ponderous pachyderm across the country. his adventures on the way are only mildly amusing at best. janeane garofalo's considerable comedic talents go largely untapped. anita gillette is impressive in her small role as jack's mother (who has a lot of explaining to do), and pat hingle stands out as a former circus associate of jack's father. -- perhaps the second half of the movie was better than the first, but i find that hard to believe...
