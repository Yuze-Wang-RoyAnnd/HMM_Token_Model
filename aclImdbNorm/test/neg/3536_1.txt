spoiler!!!! mind ripper hmmmm.... i had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about giovanni ribisi. i thought giovanni ribisi hadnt done any horrors so i checked into it. i saw "the outpost" (mind ripper) i checked on my tivo for it. there was an air date on sci fi. so i was set. i got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this? a freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling! nothing is scary about this movie at all! if anything its funny! funny how low the budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it didnt make. ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb. it is so stupid. they killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the "monster" is on it. they shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground. and<br /><br />-gasp- the killer ending, its still alive! woohhh! scary! woooohhhh! sucky fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours.<br /><br />bottom line: you have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time. mind ripper isnt the suggestion. i'd rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time.<br /><br />overall grade: f- - - - - - - - - - (enternal)
