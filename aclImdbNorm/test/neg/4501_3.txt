"destroy all planets" winds up settling for 'destroy all tokyo' by film's end, as a space monster resembling a giant squid falls to the reptilian furnace known as gamera. actually, gamera is saving earth right from the get go, knocking out varian space ship #1 even before the first set of film credits roll. the scene switches to a japanese scout camp where we meet a pair of meddlesome young heroes, jim and masao, who take part in gamera's exploits after being kidnapped by the aliens and beamed aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield.<br /><br />it's pretty startling to see the boys convince a scientist to let them operate a newly invented submarine that might be defective. previously boy genius masao had wired the unit to run in reverse direction of it's controls, but dr. dobie didn't think about checking that out as a possibility. at least that prepared the boys for interfering with the alien space ship's controls by playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks.<br /><br />when boss alien viras says 'activate the videotron', hang on to your seats for rehashed footage from earlier gamera movies where he battles barugon and gyaos. these take up quite a bit of screen time, but are no match for the fast forward button if you want to get on with it. for the longest time viras addressed an invisible crew, and when they finally appeared, they were orientals who could fly - imagine that!<br /><br />seeing as how these movies were made for a juvenile audience, it's surprising to see how gruesome some of the scenes are. gamera drawing blood comes to mind, and how about the pair of space crew members being decapitated. when squid tentacles started emerging from the headless bodies i made a connection to the 'alien' films; having the individual units merge to form the giant viras was a neat device.<br /><br />i guess the appeal for young kids might reside in identifying with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, move around pretty freely on an alien space ship, and get to have whatever they want with the help of alien telepathy technology. seeing as how the movie was presumably made by adults, it could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment.
