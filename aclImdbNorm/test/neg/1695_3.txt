maybe this wowed them in the 50's, but this is one of those flicks that doesn't age well. it's got that preachy, earnest, downtrodden working man vibe of a 2nd rate rod serling live tv "playhouse" broadcast. the "plot" is by the book, the cassevetes character's troubled background seems tacked-on, and the love interest is unconvincing and half-hearted.<br /><br />sidney portier gives an ok performance, but man he sure was an annoying, haughty snot. if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse i'd probably want to hit him with a grappling hook too. jack warden is good, because as usual, he plays jack warden.<br /><br />like 90% of the films rated on imdb (whether they are classics, mediocre or crapola) somehow this one gets rated with 7-point-some-stars. it is in no way deserving of that. save your time
