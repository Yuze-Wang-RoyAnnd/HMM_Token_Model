there were nice characters in here, played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers.....yet the film just didn't work. by the time this was almost over, i was bored to death. the dialog was dumb, the humor (mainly milton berle's) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley.<br /><br />i've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if i hear "in the mood" one more time i'll puke.<br /><br />this was my first look at famous skater-actor sonja henie and i have no complaints about her. almost part of the problem, at least with the humor, is that it's so dated it isn't funny anymore. berle, phil silvers, bob hope, red skeleton, abbot & costello, etc. etc. were hilarious to the crowds in the 40s and 50s but humor changes, and what was funny back then is not today.
