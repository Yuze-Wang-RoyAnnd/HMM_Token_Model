poor bela lugosi. just another day at work. a group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the american war effort from the inside. it's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. there are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. a police force that doesn't know what is going on. what a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. there are comments like, "a true patriot would do this or that." it's obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldn't know a spy or a subversive if it jumped up and bit them. i also was surprised to see clayton moore (the lone ranger) in a romantic role. i never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse. there is, of course, the smugness of the criminals as they think that they are immune from the killer's guest list. anyway, bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one. the best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil it. as a curiosity, and a period piece, it may be fun to watch for some people.
