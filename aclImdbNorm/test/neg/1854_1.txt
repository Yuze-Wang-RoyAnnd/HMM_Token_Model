it is hard to imagine two actors of such class and experience as michael caine and michael gambon getting involved in such an embarrassingly inept film. the responsibility for this ill-judged production has to be down to the writer, neil jordan and director, conor mcpherson. i doubt i've seen such a bad film with such good credits in a long time. the comedian, dylan moran, who made his mark as the irritable and incompetent bookshop owner in the tv sitcom, blackbooks, turns in much the same routine here, except with such excess and lack of comedic control as to leave one squirming. it is easy to see how the story could have been made to work, for the situation is an interesting one and loaded with comic potential. a classical actor (caine) tries to rip off the mob (gambon and co) with the aide of a bumbling wannabe colleague (moran), with predictable results. it could have and should have been good. sadly, it was not to be.
