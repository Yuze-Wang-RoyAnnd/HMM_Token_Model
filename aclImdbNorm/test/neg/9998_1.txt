i occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show's "contestants" are. they are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune.<br /><br />for anyone to appear on national tv and blubber, sniffle, and whine about being fat (entirely their own fault) is nauseating. what does this say about us as a nation? does it suggest that your lifestyle choices, and the consequences of them, aren't our responsibility? <br /><br />"the biggest loser" is an appropriate title, but it has nothing to do with one's weight.<br /><br />absolute trash.
