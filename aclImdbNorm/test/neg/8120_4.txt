dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard. she traps him into bringing her back with him.<br /><br />glynis johns, in the title role, is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out.<br /><br />margaret rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here. in fact, miss rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts.<br /><br />nice to see david tomlinson in the film. he would get together with johns in the far superior "mary poppins," 16 years later.<br /><br />miranda causes mischief in that two guys, a neighbor's fianc'ee and chauffeur (tomlinson) fall for her.<br /><br />ask any mermaid you happen to see, what's the best tuna, chicken of the sea! as for this film, forget it.
