boring, rank nefarious plot, some of the worst direction i've ever come across, inane acting and horribly clich'ed. the movie ends with one of the main characters waking from a dream. what's with that? even jr from dallas couldn't survive that lame twist. <br /><br />you have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a young girl, which is ostensibly meant to be fatherly, but which comes off as perverse. you have freshman community college movie school special effects with loopholes the size of the kimberly hole. this is like children of the corn meets passion of the christ imposed on an endless loop of government administration training video - by the end of it, if you aren't contemplating ending it, you have no brain.<br /><br />don't bother.
