extremely slow movie.there are fine performances from all actors which is why above 5 score.surya and jyo are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we are shown this till it gets to a point you start asking is there a story.then one day jyo discovers surya's diary to find his failed college love story .the college love story is totally unconvincing as surya is an arrogant senior who is always picking on bhoomika, beats up her friend, yells at her in public and despite being terrified of him she falls in love for him.even after that he continues to dominate her using crude language.i certainly could not appreciate the meek character played by bhoomika, i don't think any self respecting woman will fall for such jerks in real life.so jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after that is the climax. the story is extremely weak in its characters.a extremely arrogant surya to bhoomika is the exact opposite with jyo( and there is no reason given for the sudden change in character).again a extremely meek bhoomika becomes a big extrovert when she returns.wonder, if she had turned so super confident why didn't she try to find her love as she no longer feared anyone.
