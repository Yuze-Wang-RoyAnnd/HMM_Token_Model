as a fan of the old series i must say that this is at best a parody of a much beloved series. first the old series would at least attempt to follow some military structure. i know in this p.c. world it is not the thing to do but hey don't turn it into the care bears. in the old series beachead was a hardspoken soldier, now he is a teenage mutant turtle. another thing is the flying tank, ok it flies out of the cobra base and bounces off the copter and they are both ok???? lets face it if the next one is not better this could spell the end of g.i.joe.
