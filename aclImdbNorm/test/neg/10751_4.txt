low-budget murder mystery about a public defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously. complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the pd believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. gig young as the pd is okay, and james anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below par. director george archainbaud was apparently more at home making westerns--he was churning out gene autry's tv series at columbia at around this time--but even if he had tried to inject any liveliness into this picture, the hack script would have defeated his attempts. average at best, the film climaxes with a courtroom scene that's straight out of an episode of "perry mason" and is just as predictable.
