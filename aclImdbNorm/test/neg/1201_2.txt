without actually giving away my age, i saw this for the first time over 20 years ago when it first came out on video (maybe it was a beta tape??) and i was old enough to drink (barely) and perhaps i had had a few because i remember thinking how great this movie was! i have since seen it sober and have to admit it is a pretty bad film. as mentioned in other posts the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor acting just makes it worse. it's a poor attempt to fantasize that teenagers too, can be "mavericks" (although i am surprised to find out it actually was to be released the same time (aprox) as "top gun", and not actually meant to be a poor imitation.) but for all it's worth - i do find myself watching it if it's on and i have the time. it's one of those movies you watch because it's just so ridiculous and tries so desperately to take itself seriously. like that other "great' film - "moment by moment" with john travolta and lily tomlin....don't get me started on that one!
