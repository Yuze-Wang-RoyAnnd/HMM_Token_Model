i don't mean to sound pretentious here, but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the lowering standards filmmakers have for themselves. this movie is an offense to everything we hold sacred, and not in the good "artsy " way of offending. this film becomes the archetype for painful dialogue, delivered by even more pathetic actors.
