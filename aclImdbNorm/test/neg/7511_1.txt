i saw this film in a cinema-club in germany in 1970. most of the attendees were from the local private school at which i was teaching. i had seen a few godard films previously while i lived in france, and, though they hadn't been my favorites, i could at least make sense of them. being able to speak french helped.<br /><br />the fairly innocuous beginning of "le week-end" soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, maybe too well photographed, that soon made no sense to me. for me, films, like books, must have some clear sort of meaning. this didn't for me. i suppose i'm not "into" artsy films. images still haunt me from the film. to this day i refuse to eat rabbit meat, well-loved by the french. those who've seen the film might realize why. yes, the theme of materialism came through, but the cannibalism, the car wrecks, and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me. i'm not sure if i walked out before the end, but i certainly felt like it. i promised myself that i'd never watch another godard film, and i haven't and never knowingly will.<br /><br />my rating: nothing. it was the most disgusting film i've ever seen. others may have been more inept, silly or stupid. i've forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever.
