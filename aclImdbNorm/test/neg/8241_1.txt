sorry i couldn't disagree more ,with the last comments . frankly i thought this was worse than carry on columbus , enough said . last film for the usually brilliant charles hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the highly witty level of on the buses, films of which were being made at the same time ,were frankly funnier .barbara windsor was embarrassing,a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a scotsman , rab c nesbit he ain't. the series miraculously trundled on with duffers like carry on behind ,and carry on england . carry on dick wasn't bad , but really with this film the end of the series was nigh , a pity because up to this film i cant think of bad film before this?
