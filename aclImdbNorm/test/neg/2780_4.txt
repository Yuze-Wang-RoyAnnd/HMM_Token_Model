dark harvest is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs which manages to come off as a kind of semi-professional movie. unfortunately the poor effects, wooden acting and unoriginal story makes this a very mediocre horror slasher at best. by no means is dark harvest the worst horror movie i've ever seen, it just isn't anything special and has nothing in it to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel. you know a director has doubts about their own horror film when a) there is some pointless nudity and b) the movie's so short they add some rather boring outtakes at the end credits that nobody really cares about because the movie wasn't that good! a slightly better movie which i can't help feeling was the inspiration for dark harvest is the eighties movie 'scarecrows' which is an ok movie but still pretty average.<br /><br />dark harvest isn't as bad as some of the other comments say it is but don't think that you will be entertained much either. one thing i also have to comment on is the character of angela who has a really terrible english accent! what was the point in that?! to maybe give it a certain touch of class? yeah right! english people do not say "waahtaah" when they mean to say "water" and i don't care what part of england they are from! if you can't find a genuine english actress or a non-english actress who can put on a brilliant english accent (not many of them about) then don't bother! sheesh! final score: 4/10
