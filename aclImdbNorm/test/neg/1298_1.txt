this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen; i gave it one star simply because it is the lowest score possible. whoever thought flood would ever be a good film? the director and cast should be ashamed and then it dawned on me this could all be part of a shambolic scare tactic. only propaganda could be this bad.<br /><br />the redeeming feature of flood is that it's ghastliness and shameless formulaic storyline make it funny. if only the characters had the same depth as created by the flood itself, yet they galumph from sound bite to sound bite without any emotional response whatsoever.<br /><br />the sad thing about this film is that it could have been so much better, informative, imaginative and tense. flood has the amateur streak to found in many recent british films where a more focused use of funds would have made for a better entertainment.<br /><br />where was smithee?
