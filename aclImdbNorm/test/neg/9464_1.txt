i can't believe i even tried to watch this filth. as an avid b-horror movie fan, i was more than riveted at the prospect of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker herschell gordon lewis. unfortunately, right from the opening of the film, i could not, for the life of me, think of a worse movie than this. well, maybe gigli, but i firmly believe dr. gore (the body shop) is worse when i think about it. a horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of. however, i will admit to the pure hilarity of a couple scenes when dr. gore is mesmorizing his soon-to-be victims. the camera zooms in on his overly large, bulbous eyes, while the whole time there is this purely putrid soundtrack to add to the amusement. i laughed for the better part of 10 minutes. after he erects his "miracle woman", the movie wastes away nearly 20 minutes just showing him and his "girlfriend" as he is teaching her to speak, then they talk, frolic among marigolds, have picnics, etc. unfortunately, there is only music playing during this whole fandango with no speech whatsoever. this portion of the movie will leave you wishing you had slit your wrists with the dull edge of a butter knife. i almost want to puke at the very thought of this movie. if you like movies that are bad, watch this one.
