people call a 976 "party line" to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. a deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don't discriminate! a pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. one of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her (or anyone).<br /><br />meanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the siblings' victims. he's teamed with a female assistant of the district attorney.<br /><br />nothing too special here. richard roundtree has little more than a cameo as the police chief. one of the dirty-talking sixteen year olds is played by an actress who also voiced peanuts character peppermint patty! according to the imdb, the other died quite young, just several years after this movie: sad.
