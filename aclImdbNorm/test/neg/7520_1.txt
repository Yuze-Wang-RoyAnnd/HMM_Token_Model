this movie sucked. from beginning to end it was predictable. there was absolutly no chemistry between pearce and the mumba chick. the plot went nowhere, floating off into oblivion. all of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity. and i wanted to strangle orlando jones, the guy just needs to go away.
