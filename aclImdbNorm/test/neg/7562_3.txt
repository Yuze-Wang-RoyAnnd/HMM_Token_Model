i saw the film many times, and every time i am more and more disappointed,which is shame because the films from ex yu are usually very good. the shame here is, that holiwood tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea. my self coming from the balkans(macedonia) found this film disappointing.simply that the bosnian characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed. to understand the mentality of a person from ex yu, you need to know their background, way of live, what makes them cry and laugh.and the director of the film didn't took that as guideline. when we(ex yu) make films, lots of symbolism is build in it, which makes the characters recognisable and likable, and mostly portraying the truth(if it is based on true story) the films like "pritty village, pretty flame", "tito and me', "underground',"no mans land', "before the rain","black cat, white cat","otac na sluzbenom putu",(when father was away on business),"ko to tamo peva"(who sings over there?)rare the masterpiece of the balkan cinematography,and nothing can compare to it. not the half baked story of and holiwood studio. as somebody from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection. i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american armchair variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too, and some of them live on the balkans and sarajevo too. and to add insult to the injury, half of the things are shoot in bitola ,macedonia where i come from. imagen my shock when i saw the broad st. of bitola in the opening scene of the film, when the bride is shoot from the sniper.and what was that inserting real footage of the news covering in the film? anyway very disappointing, as the truth is far away from the film. shame that nobody consulted the real people how is to live in sarajevo under fire, before they shoot the film. book is one thing and real life is other, and this film lets down both.
