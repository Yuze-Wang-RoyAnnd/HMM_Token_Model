i hated this film. simply put, this film is so bad that i almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it. but on the other hand, i can't resist a good bashing. and if there's one thing that evan almighty does for the audience it is that it brings out the best criticism.<br /><br />the film (a sequel to the much funnier bruce almighty) starts out by reintroducing the audience to evan baxter, a mere supporting at best character in the original film. that's right. this film shows no jim carrey or jennifer anisten. not even a small cameo appearance. you know your film is bad when the guy that agreed to do ace venture: when nature calls won't even have a short walk-on role. but somehow they manage to keep morgan freeman as god. while sitting in the near empty theater bored out of my mind at the lack of comedy i couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to secure freeman for this film. then it hit me an hour ago. it's just a throwaway role that takes up all of 20 minutes in the 100 minute film. god just pops up in between scenes to tell evan to build the ark. sure i know morgan freeman won't look at this film in a year and think it's as good as his roles in the shawshank redemption and million dollar baby but it's easy money.<br /><br />where was i? oh yes, the plot. sometimes it's so hard to keep focused on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought thinking about the plot than the writer of the screenplay did. anyway evan (steve carell) has apparently left his job as a news anchorman for a job as a congressman. yeah... with no transition in between. he never turns to his wife and says "i think i want to be a congressman." it just happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition. well as a congressman he is to partner for a bill proposed by john goodman's character when suddenly god appears to tell evan to build an ark. no "hey, how you doing? how's the weather?" bit. just "i want you to build an ark." evidence of bad writing: evan determines that god is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing a fan hold up a sign saying genesis 6:14 when he's walking past his son whose watching a televised baseball game.<br /><br />that's basically the plot of evan almighty. there are some random supporting cast members that do their best at creating comedy but they don't do very well because they aren't given hardly any screen time. it's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark film. oh and also there's that obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his hiking plans with his kids and wife because he becomes busy with work. they walk off disappointed but they understand, as do all the other times in film this has happened. just once would i love to see the youngest kid turn to his father and kick him in the chins and tell him "you're a real bastard for canceling your plans with us. i'm going to turn emo now." there's also that drama that you'd expect from the father with his family when they realize (the wife, actually... the three kids have no problem helping dad build an ark) that he's gone crazy and he claims god wants him to build a big boat. but don't worry. his family decides to stick with him. oops, i just spoiled the drama.<br /><br />another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy going on. i know the decision was made to rate have this be a pg film to get a bigger crowd reaction but i don't think i'm in the minority when i think that family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in the nuts and animals crapping. maybe i'm wrong and that's what quality family humor has been reduced to. and if it is, please bring me more adult comedies so i won't have to sit through anymore of this crap (pun not intended).<br /><br />the ending is extra cheesy. all of a sudden the film takes a dramatic cgi filled turn that makes me shudder to think how it is a terrible waste of cgi. i bet it was expensive too. finally after all that waiting we are told why god wanted evan to build an ark. and boy oh boy i hated the reason why. i'll spare the details but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for one second and had no lines.<br /><br />oh and then there's a nice touch at the very end. the song "gonna make you sweat (everybody dance now)" plays over the credits and we are then subjected to the "dancing" of the cast. i don't get it. they spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully making a comedy and then they wrap it up with a thriller. i swear i haven't been that scared watching steve carell dance since ... well never. there you have it folks. evan almighty is the scariest film of all time.<br /><br />all in all i thought it was a wasted experience. i'm baffled at all the talented actors (carell, freeman and goodman) appearing in this bore-fest alongside lauren graham, the woman from gilmore girls that has yet to prove to me that she can act her way out of a paper bag. but most of all i'm surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out.<br /><br />rating: * out of ****
