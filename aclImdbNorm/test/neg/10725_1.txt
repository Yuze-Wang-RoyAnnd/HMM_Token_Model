a satire about greed and money, what? there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. jim carrey's reign was certainly short lived. he is an unbearable presence on the screen. the insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. he produced this, this "masterpiece" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. "the number one comedy in america" shout the desperate tv adds. of course, jim carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over. if i sound angry is because i am. i spent a sunny afternoon in california, plus, between tickets, parking, flat cokes etc, almost 45 bucks on this thing, starring and produced by mr carry. not anymore, do you hear? not anymore.
