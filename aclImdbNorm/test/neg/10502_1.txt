if you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.<br /><br />i feel for you, i *really* do. and i profusely apologize as a canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.<br /><br />i, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b-movie ripoff of blade. i thought, "sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie." i'll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their 'creation': thanks for removing the rec xx/xx/xx from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie.<br /><br />and for the record, i *saw* the movie, but did not watch it. the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, i swear to god.<br /><br />you know what? i'm not writing anymore about this. it's just too painful.
