i love ben kingsley and tea leoni. however, this is easily the worst movie i have seen in 10 years, and i see my share of movies. a stinker. this is a bad idea for a movie, poorly executed. nothing about it is funny, credible or interesting. i was looking for wit, irony and genuine humor. instead, this looked like most of the cast members wandered on to the set to do tea leoni a favor. it's too bad such acting talent was wasted on such hollowness. don't bother. i have to wonder what opinion the makers of this movie have of their audience to subject them to the idea of polish gangsters in buffalo, ny sending a contract murderer to san francisco to become a mortuary assistant while attending aa meetings. bill pullman should begin reading scripts before he agrees to be in a movie. sad.
