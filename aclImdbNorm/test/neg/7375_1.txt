i absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. i honestly thought gay men had better taste than this. i know i do.<br /><br />the bulk of the blame doesn't lie with the cast, but let's get them out of the way first...the only one with real talent was joe souza (plus he had the best bod in the cast). he had a nice, clear theatre-style voice. okay, and jaymes hodges' voice was so-so, but he had a vacant expression in every number. the rest couldn't hold a note in a bucket, even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact. must have been really dreadful hearing them live. they were also all girly-boys except for maybe three. if i wanted to see naked women onstage i could go to the titty bars. not sure why anyone would choose to film the l.a. production instead of new york. i would imagine ny has more readily available singing talent, though one would think in l.a. they would be able to find better-looking guys. apparently not.<br /><br />but i digress...the real blame here lies with the creators and producers. this score was the most banal, insipid tripe i have ever heard. it sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical cd's, threw them in a blender and poured the goo onto a page. sadly, i'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is. i mean seriously, i was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes. i think the morbid 'my-lover-has-died-of-aids-song' entitled "kris, look what you've missed" was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. genius writing...kris / missed...wow...they almost rhyme...must be a good lyric. and jesus...the end of that song..."oh kris, ohhh kris, ohhhh kris..." over and over!!! my other favorite was "you gotta be a pumpy junkie boy to be a humpy hunkie boy"...wtf??? the whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics just because they rhymed. where did these people learn to write songs? apparently they listened to sondheim and said "he's not so great, i can do that"...as evidenced by the retarded "bobby, bobby, bobby" reference from company in one song. another irk: why are 20-somethings singing about robert mitchum and tab hunter? obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not the actors...again, bad writing.<br /><br />if you love torture and pain, and i know many of you strange fetishists do, go ahead and watch it. but you've been warned.
