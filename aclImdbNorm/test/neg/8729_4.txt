"the apartment complex" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student (lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery...um, if you can call it that. this low cal watch contains no suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a dash of nudity, and almost no romance. "the apartment complex" is passable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes.
