worst. movie. ever. i can't believe they had to hire jeremy irons to give this piece of crap some credibility - and still failed. did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own? (probably). "hey, let's make lots of things explode and give mina big boobs, and have her speak in an adorably fake broken english. that'll make the morons watch." "but sir, that's not how the book went at all, i think we're mot being faithful to mr. wells' message." "f*ck it, we're going to the box office here, never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature. also, let's add in orlando jones with some classic 'black attitude' as a supporting character, and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book - guy pierce has to get some p*ssy at the end."
