about the spoiler warning? it's not "may contain", it -does- contain spoilers. readers beware. <br /><br />okay, first i need it to be known that i'm not bashing the actors. they're just working with what they're given. the problem was the script. it was horrendous. there was nothing believable about it at all. sure, when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, there's going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific, movie-worthy situation. but these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision. the only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because he'd already killed one and hit another with a car. speaking of hitting her with a car...why the hell did she try and outrun a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person? also, does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood? frankly, it wasn't suspenseful either. the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were. well, this rant has gone on way longer than i meant to for such a bad movie, so i won't bother to touch on the end besides the fact it's unrealistic and lame.
