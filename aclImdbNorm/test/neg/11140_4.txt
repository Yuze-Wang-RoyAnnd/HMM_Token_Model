yes, it's pure trash. it might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema (like me) to see lowlifes babbling and doing nothing for almost two hours, but it gets very painful when you realize you have actually paid for this. probably, this is one of those films you love to watch for its complete emptiness and nihilism. i accept it though for its shock value, decades before trainspotting and pulp fiction.
