the english translation of the title on the dvd version of this film is "graveyard of horrors," but i think that must be an error. it should have been called "graveyard of horribles." horrible acting, horrible editing, horrible story, and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard.<br /><br />horrible.
