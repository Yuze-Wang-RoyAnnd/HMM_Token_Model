like most, i rented this after i heard the universal praise. and despite countless bizarre, unexplainable moments along the way, i was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film. then the two women went to the "performance" late at night. the rest of movie (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen. then the movie abruptly ends.<br /><br />baffled, i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened. nothing made sense, and i'm a pretty clever guy. none of these other user comments made sense, even when they say "spoilers." i still have no idea what they're saying. someone's dream? not real? then what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's "not real?" or is it real? i'm forced to make a choice. either:<br /><br />[a] the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and i'm simply too stupid to understand it.<br /><br />[b] the movie is weird for weird's sake and just doesn't make sense. everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they "get" it.<br /><br />i choose [b]. screw you guys, i'm going home...
