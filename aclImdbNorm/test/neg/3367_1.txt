horrible movie. this movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the worst movie i have ever suffered through. what the !@$% were the morons who made this film thinking. was it supposed to be scary. because man let me tall you it wasn't. it was so dumb it wasn't funny. we all know that tropical islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer snowmen. and those stupid baby snowballs. stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. fake snow and lousy actors. oh and frost looks nothing like he does on the box. do not waste your time. rent it and destroy it.
