i was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. this has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.<br /><br />the concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on american idol. you watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. but we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. so how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an american idol tryout? it would be pointless as this movie was.<br /><br />the use of improv is over-rated. we've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. i feel that is improv. improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. if you like that drew carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film.<br /><br />overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. if a guy playing a trumpet and the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. for me, i prefer more heady stuff like "i love lucy" or "hee-haw".<br /><br />but remember, i think snl lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this g-rated humor. i kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. that's the humor you can expect.<br /><br />my only wish was that i could give this a minus rating.
