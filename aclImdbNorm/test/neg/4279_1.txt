here is another low quality movie from the "disney" company. there is no more disney spirit. the story is boring. all emotions are fake. it is not cute or moving. disney company was at a time a sort of magic company which provided dreams for children. it is now all about making money. shame on the people who exploit disney name for their personal benefit. it is the fall of an empire. and, by the way, pixar is not disney !
