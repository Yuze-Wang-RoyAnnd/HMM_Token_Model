i think that most people would agree with me if i were to say that the movie alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere. i've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have ever exceeded alien's eerie tunnels and darkened halls. the cave is a film that tries very hard to reset the bar. i believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as alien yet not once throughout the movie did i ever feel even the slightest bit scared, or thrilled for that matter.<br /><br />so now that we got the ball of negativity rolling i might as well explain why the cave's main hook (the atmosphere in case you weren't paying attention) fizzled into a waste of my time. i'll say right now that most of the sets were gorgeous and nicely lit but what we hear and what we know is there tend to ruin what we see. the music for one is terrible. we either get corny rock music or over exaggerated haunted house music. okay maybe that's pushing it a bit but i couldn't bear it. the many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell) i didn't need rock music blaring in my ears while they were simply swimming through a cave. this actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then amplified by the following watercraft crash scene.<br /><br />anyway as i already mentioned, it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere, heck no. the creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to invoke horror. i'm supposed to be worried that they are going to appear and merely a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood turn cold. the cave does wisely take a page from the alien handbook by not showing the entire creature for very long and leading up to the reveal with only glimpses but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so lame. i guess it would be rude to spoil the specifics but they are basically the aliens with wings.<br /><br />i guess you get the point by now. atmosphere ruined. yet i know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting. i'd like to say that about the cave but i'd be lying. this movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day. we've seen all this done better before with the exception of a few neat scenes (the guy impaled on stalactites, the eel and the rapids) so you really don't get any thrills from watching people running from uninspired alien knockoffs in endless tunnels.<br /><br />ah but no the pain doesn't end there. we must also take the characters and acting into account. well i can't remember a single line of dialogue other than "run!" and the only character's name i can remember is jack but that's only because it's placed in almost every other line near the end of the movie. perhaps the actors were capable but the script didn't allow them to do anything other then run and argue. they had almost no background and whenever somebody died they simply shrugged it off. it's pretty sad when you consider that the cgi eel puts on the best performance in the film.<br /><br />speaking of cgi; there's plenty of it, most of which is terrible. i do commend them on using suits (at least i think they were suits) but nothing truly meshes with the environment and as a result most of the effects end up looking pretty hokey.<br /><br />so i guess to wrap it up, the cave is bad and has very little going for it. had the film been a scifi channel premiere movie or low budget direct to video release i might have a bit more love for it but this film was a theatrical release. with more wit and talent this might have been a frighteningly fun movie but as it stands this film is about as scary as going into the basement and that's not very good.<br /><br />my review from frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
