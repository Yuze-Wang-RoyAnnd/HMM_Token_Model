i'll give it this: i didn't stop watching, and it's not corporate, which is kind of cool. but my internal critic cut it to pieces -- i suppose i see too many movies. wooden script, the slang just sort of clanks out of their mouths without any kind of flow. editing, mentioned before, is hit and miss; sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel, but mostly its irritating -- jerky, quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups. the actors were marginal, though letisha had her moments.<br /><br />i'm not sure why the audience supposed to care about curtis, he's a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing. the directing doesn't help make you love him or hate him, even; i just wanted him to shut up and get shot already. i didn't care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around. the completely predictable ending isn't credible at all. i'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he deposes are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams. "oh, you just got out of jail and are on probation? here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, go run it around the corner for me. now don't steal from me, etc."<br /><br />a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but it was let down in the end. handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow-raising, if only mildly interesting. there are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film-school offering. 4/10, an f.
