let me begin by saying that i adore the book and loved the a&e miniseries. i was hoping to love this film, and i was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and abbreviating the actual story. however, this film scarcely resembles the original book. if only "the names had been changed to protect the innocent," i would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining, if inaccurate, period piece.<br /><br />unfortunately, putting the name "mr. darcy" on a character who is emotional and weak, giving the name "elizabeth bennett" to a reckless, snippy, often teary-eyed hoyden who cares nothing for the rules of society, and making "mr. bingley" a wide-eyed dimwit absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read jane austen's original story. <br /><br />there are some really stellar moments in this movie -- perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent. charlotte's explanation of why she accepted mr. collins' proposal begins beautifully. she is 27 years old (quite near the hopeless-spinster age in those times), she is becoming a burden on her family, and she is not romantic. she only wants "a comfortable home." however, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers, "don't you judge me, elizabeth. don't you dare judge me!" and runs off in tears. later, you see charlotte kowtow to lady catherine de bourgh, which was not at all in her character as described in the book. <br /><br />another good moment is when darcy catches elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle. it was well done in the a&e series, but the film version with keira knightley made the audience feel acutely how very humiliating that moment must have been for elizabeth. very nice.<br /><br />the ending also illustrated a level of affection between elizabeth and darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries. i actually appreciated that scene, simply because i like to see a happy ending, rather than just know that it took place. <br /><br />altogether, though, this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of austen's pride and prejudice. the characters speak in a jarring combination of austen's dialogue verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms. information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version. yes, time was a concern. it's only a short movie, yada yada. but turning a complex, beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /><br />some have commented that they loved the moment when darcy first sees elizabeth, because it is so obviously a case of "love at first sight." love at first sight? huh? one of the best aspects of the book is that elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty, and darcy comes to love her for her wit and liveliness ... he literally "loves her for her mind." <br /><br />this version also had a moment (during darcy's first proposal) when the two are yelling furiously at each other, while leaning closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but they suddenly step apart. ugh! what a sad clich'e. they're angry and disgusted with each other, but so attracted that it doesn't matter that (at the time) they don't even like each other? ridiculous! <br /><br />the characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story. mr. bennet was dour, elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters, charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own -- unlike the intelligent, slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel. jane and elizabeth's relationship is merely topical, instead of the deep-rooted love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other. <br /><br />all this i could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel, but i refused to accept all that in addition to the many, many historical inaccuracies. miss bingley walked around scarcely clothed (her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight undergarments). elizabeth walked to netherfield with her hair down and allowed to fly all over. the family lazed about one morning, though mornings were supposed to be reserved for calling on acquaintances (or being called on at your own home). elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown. and in a really appalling scene, bingley walked into jane's bedroom and conversed with her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was ill. <br /><br />most people would feel these are minor points, but i simply wanted either a.) an historically accurate film, or b.)an accurate representation of the characters in the novel. <br /><br />the director/writer/whoever sacrificed accuracy, subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight. i can concede that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie, and there is nothing wrong with that. i simply couldn't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces.
