please give this one a miss.<br /><br />kristy swanson and the rest of the cast rendered terrible performances. the show is flat, flat, flat.<br /><br />i don't know how michael madison could have allowed this one on his plate. he almost seemed to know this wasn't going to work out and his performance was quite lacklustre, so all you madison fans give this a miss.
