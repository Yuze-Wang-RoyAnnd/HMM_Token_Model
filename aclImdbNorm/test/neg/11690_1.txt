remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old vhs recorder? "the fallen" is just a bad executed remake of those movies! the story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together make an unbearable nightmare.<br /><br />it is also terribly slow! very slow! i tried to sleep while watching it but i couldn't do it because i had nightmares of it.<br /><br />please don't watch this movie! it is that bad! ten lines is a lot so i don't know what else to say.<br /><br />press the eject button now and you wont regret it!
