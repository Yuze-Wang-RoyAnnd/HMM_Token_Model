it's important to check your expectations when you see hatchet. the *buzz that has been generated on this site far surpasses the real impact of the movie. what may help someone about to see the movie is to realize that it is --not supposed to be scary--. it is pure camp and an attempt at fun. it is not --funny--, just campy. don't expect something like shaun of the dead; nor something like friday the 13th (part ii through infinity).<br /><br />hatchet does possess passable actors. the cinematography is straight ed wood. creature effects and make-up are silly - probably on purpose. gore and blood is something between romero and dead alive. hatchet is a movie of betweenness. it's between shaun of the dead and leslie vernon. it's between campy and comedy (there's a difference). it's between ultra violent and violent comic book.<br /><br />instead of "capturing the essence of american horror," or whatever other silly jargon that has been used to describe the movie, it tries to capture something between seminal --american-- horror like friday the 13th and new horror like shaun. it thankfully stays away from torture horror.<br /><br />in the end hatchet is between a bad movie and a decent movie.<br /><br />*i think it is happening more and more that people involved in movies are flocking to sites like imdb to rate and comment on the movies that they are involved with. at very least there is campaigning going on for people associated with the associates to leave positive feedback and ratings. there is no other reason for this movie to have stared out in the high 7s with 600 votes and quickly fall after wide release. this movie is on just better than the horrorfest releases and should not be so bloated.
