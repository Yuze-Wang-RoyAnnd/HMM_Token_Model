wow... just... wow. there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own. i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting, writing, and directing - whoo boy does it ever. however, i think there is some other problems here.<br /><br />1. why is christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? the film acts as though you just can't be a christian and also allow for the possibility? why? they ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e. "the bible doesn't say there is aliens." "well, the bible doesn't say there isn't.), but the actual rebuttal is never answered. the bible really doesn't say there isn't. so how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand? or better yet, acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them.<br /><br />2. how come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax? what about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences? what if it's something else entirely? too bad the film makers already have their minds made up.<br /><br />3. the film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult. that's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present. i'm not necessarily arguing that they don't, but if you're going to say something so asinine you'd better have the facts to back it up.<br /><br />4. why does the other reporter (not the greasy haired blonde guy, the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? it's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool.<br /><br />i wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and ufo phenomena, but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their "faith message" to care much about make a thought provoking movie. as a christian myself, this saddens me.
