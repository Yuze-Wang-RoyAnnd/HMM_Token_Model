people don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. the same type of people that see a movie with carrot top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. is carrot top funny? of course not. was this movie anything special? of course not. it was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about mr. top. movies like this, or kazaam, or killer klowns from outer space and pretty much any movie pauly shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. you watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think carrot top is hilarious.<br /><br />please people if you ready know carrot top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.
