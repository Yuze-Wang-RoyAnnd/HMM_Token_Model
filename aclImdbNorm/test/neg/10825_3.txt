the scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end alludes to a sequel. 'the cave' is really a disappointing action movie. a team of cave and undersea researchers go to romania (one of these inexpensive places to make a movie, for now at least) and following a destroyed church enter in a cave that proves to be a realm of underground monsters. or are they daemons? the movie never decides if it wants to be action, science fiction, or horror, it is a mix of all without salt or fun, and acted in a wooden manner. the best thing about the movie is the cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave becomes soon boring, because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interesting. waste of time.
