hey, i'm a fan of so-bad-so-good movies but there's nothing so-bad-so-good about rise of the undead. it's just so-bad and that's it. no redeeming cheese, no unintentional humor, nothing! - boring apocalyptic zombie (the "undead" : a few people with hardly any make up) nonsense with lame special effects (if you can call those effects), dumb plot and annoying actors. they also have the nerve to rip off and quote from other (better) movies (resident evil, dawn of the dead & night of the comet) and managed to put me to sleep on the side. however, it was rise of my eyelids once the end credits rolled though. my advice: save your money. it's not even worth a rental, unless you want to p*ss off and/or put some people to sleep then go ahead and give it a spin. you've been warned ;)
