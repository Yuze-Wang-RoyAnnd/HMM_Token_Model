well i'd have to say that i do own this film and i only like the ending. the movie is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny. lets just say that if the fake bird didn't attack the main evil guy this movie would be a 0 out of 10. the bird though makes it a 3. if you are truly bored or want something terrible to watch rent this and fast forward to the final battle.
