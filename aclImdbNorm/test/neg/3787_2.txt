pretty terrible, but not entirely unwatchable. another review mentioned "predictable" - and that's almost an understatement. you can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be. every character is either stereotype or archetypical. the good guy in a bad situation, the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline, the repressed, sexually/emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city, engaged to the hotheaded, feeble minded beau from youth, the unredeemable bad guys, two "lost boys" looking for a sense of family - they're all here, and none of them with even the remotest spin of something new. from the first few minutes you can figure out exactly what will happen by film's end. the story isn't entirely lame, but direction, acting (even from a cast with some talent) everything is thrown together without skill. as to the storyline, we've all seen it before in a movie called "sister act." this is also one of those films where inattention to small details show up in an even more glaring light. (as example: the nurse and our hero drive into town but park several blocks away from their destinations (post office and hardware store) - yet both walk across empty parking lots for no apparent reason. or the passage of morning to night during a scene that seemingly should occur in no more than half an hour. the movie is filled with that kind of stuff and then tags on an improbable denouement.
