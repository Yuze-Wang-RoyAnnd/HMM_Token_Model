when a movie's claim to fame is that martin sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. "soultaker" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. it's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.<br /><br />the plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be. joe estevez isn't much of an actor, so luckily for the audience, he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking. this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror/fantasy franchise, considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher. 4 characters, each dies one at a time...will any live? who really cares. though it sounds like i hated this, i didn't. i just didn't like it very well, but i was interested through most of it, so i guess that counts for something.<br /><br />my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. pg-13 for language, violence and nudity.
