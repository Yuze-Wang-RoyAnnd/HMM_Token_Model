my only regret is that one cannot grade a movie on imdb with a 0. "a cena..." would definitely deserve that! at least.<br /><br />*spoiler?* the movie starts with a bunch of people entering a crypt to awaken an ancient vampire. when a guy cuts himself and his blood drips and falls onto the putrid and dried corpse that is supposed to be a bloodsucker, the metamorphosis takes place and the vampire, in an animation-like effect (would you believe it!), quickly takes on a more human form,only to reveal that he's wearing a tux and a bow-tie! a bow-tie, yes. red, if my memory serves me right! i tried to check out random scenes by skipping through a bit, but it did not get any better than the opening sequences. that's the point when i turned the movie off, cursing it for having made me hope to see a vampire movie. this is surely not one,unless you're 5 and could take such stupidity seriously.<br /><br />so, if you like vampires and don't want to feel revolted or even disgusted,learn from my mistake and don't even try to see this garbage!
