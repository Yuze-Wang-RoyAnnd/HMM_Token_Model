i really tried to give this film a chance but when i realized that most of the film was being told by a bunch of boring officials walking around and talking on phones, i knew it was over. a lot of this film also looked like stock footage. that's just lame.<br /><br />the camera person kept like doing these quick short zooms for no reason! it bothered me so much but i was just wondering why in the heck did they think it was a good idea. it doesn't add anything to a static scene of two people talking. this isn't nypd blue or some cop show or something.<br /><br />how could they have not realized that telling this type a story from conversations of people in conference rooms and what not, is boring?!! did they not watch this mess? anyway, this was just a really boring movie and it does make it seem like whoever made it doesn't understand good storytelling in film.<br /><br />darn stock footage... that's just wrong.
