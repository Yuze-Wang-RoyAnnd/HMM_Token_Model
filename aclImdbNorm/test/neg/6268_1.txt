do you hear that sound? that's the sound of h.g. wells rolling over in his grave, between this version and spielberg's cinematic abortion it's been a tough year for the classic novel. but at least steven got a few things right compared to this crapperella. hello, the ships weren't big insects, they had names. they were tripods and the aliens worked in threes. the ships and the aliens were all wrong, you don't really get to see the aliens until the end. the effects and the cast work fine. but these actors are much better then this "movie" deserves. the bulk if not all the movie is the howell character wondering through the devastation, meeting one person, they join him and he looses them for one reason or the other. there's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie. it's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget or something. so fat the only and mean only watchable adaptation of the war of the worlds story is the george pal version way back in the 1950s. the black hole.
