adventures in dinosaur city, though a creative idea, was a nauseatingly atrocious attempt at filmmaking. being sucked into a tv and into a new world is interesting. three teens obsessively enthralled with half-animated dinosaurs is not. don't waste the time or the brain power to see this sure loser. i wouldn't even let my kids watch it.
