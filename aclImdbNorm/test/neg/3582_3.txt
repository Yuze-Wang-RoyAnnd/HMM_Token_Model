i caught the north american premiere of this at the chicago international film festival. i was beyond disappointed. from the mood in the audience, i wasn't the only one.<br /><br />the film takes a long time to get to the conflict, and then refuses to resolve it, opting instead to tell us the story is "to be continued". is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no ending? i consider it more of a warning. this is, at best, only half a movie- and not the good half.
