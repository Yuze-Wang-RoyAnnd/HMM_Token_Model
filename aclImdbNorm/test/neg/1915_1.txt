i'm not sure why i disliked this film so much. maybe i'm too old or too male or too something. just who was the target audience here? if you're it and you liked it, then i'm happy for you. personally, i found it a bit of a pill. the characters were uninteresting and unlikeable, the script was just plain embarrassing and some, though not all, of the acting was uninspired. mawkish, tedious and occasionally nauseating -- surely there's something better on.<br /><br />on a related issue: why is it that whenever i see chris klein in a film i get an urge to slap him silly? does anyone else get that?
