this film was released in the uk under the name blood rites. it was banned outright and never submitted again for release.<br /><br />as the ghastly ones, it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry denizens of new york city's famed 42nd street grindhouse circuit. if you are looking for some bloody horror, then you will find it in this film.<br /><br />unfortunately to see the developmentally disabled colin (hal borske) chomp down on a live rabbit, you have to put up with shaky 16mm camera work that makes ed wood look positively marvelous.<br /><br />three sisters are to spend three days in the family homestead with their husbands before the old man's money is disbursed. naturally, in such a situation, people start dropping dead. family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled, especially during a gruesome dismemberment.<br /><br />maybe it was the bunny bit that the brits objected to, i know i did.
