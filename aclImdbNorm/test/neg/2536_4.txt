sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the world's foremost detective sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) outwits the nazi's & manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named dr. franz tobel (william post jr.) out of the country & to the relative safety of london. but is london as safe as holmes thinks? dr. tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever & he has agreed to give it to the british government, but those nazi's want it just as badly & holmes arch enemy professor moriarty (lionel atwill) plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight & selling it to the nazi's. add the bumbling inspector lestrade (denis hoey) of scotland yard, dr. tobel's love interest charlotte eberli (kaaren verne), assassins, mysterious scientists & a puzzling coded message & holmes has his work cut out to keep dr. tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight...<br /><br />directed by roy william neill sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen holmes films made between 1939 & 1946 to feature rathbone & bruce as holmes & watson. the script by edward t. lowe jr., scott darling & edmund l. hartmann is based on the short 'the dancing men' by sir arthur conan doyle & isn't the tradition holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story. to neglect what holmes is all about, the solving of complex crimes & mysteries is a big mistake as far as i'm concerned & the involvement of the nazi's & the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place, awkward & just didn't sit too well with me. the dialogue isn't great, professor moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn't come up with a villain for it & as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series. however, at least it's short.<br /><br />director neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack & bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago. it has no real style or imagination & lacks both atmosphere & intrigue as well.<br /><br />technically the film is ok if unspectacular, the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer colourised version is also available. the acting is alright, bruce & hoey do their usual comic relief turns & rathbone's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous & i'm glad he changed it for later instalments.<br /><br />sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series, there is very little by which i can recommend it & everything that made the other's so good seems to be missing here. leave this one till last & watch some of the better ones first, for die hard fans only.
