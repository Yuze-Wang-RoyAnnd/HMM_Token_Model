every time i've seen this movie i get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant. a movie like evil dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because sam raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. this movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably. the crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for 'awful.' watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a billy madison essay--"everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it." i should be able to give this movie something around a -5.
