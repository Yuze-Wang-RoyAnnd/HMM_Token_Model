proud as i am of being a dutchman, i'm truly shocked by flicks like these. why? why this cheap acting? why this storyline that just sucks? why a dozen sequels? why o why? they add a lot of hot dutch chicks in an effort of saving this movie from redemption, and guess what? all the underaged breezergirlies in holland go and see it. i was forced to watch it at a party. all the girls were going crazy when daan schuurmans entered the screen, all the guys took a another beer and grumbled... but the thing that really bothers me, is the fact that this kind of flicks are the only sort of movies dutch filmmakers can produce... (apart from "van god los" and "lek") this doesn't prove our superiority to other countries.. it doesn't add anything to our imagination... it just f**ks up the brains of little 13 year old girls... johan nijenhuis, i hope you will burn forever!
