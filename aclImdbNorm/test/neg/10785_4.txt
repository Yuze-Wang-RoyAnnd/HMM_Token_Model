i can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the imdb website! have i been issued with the special edition naff version? edited by dewhurst, produced by bernard matthews, this film should be housed in battersea. i'm sorry for all the uk-centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying). the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted. what on earth is irons doing in this film?
