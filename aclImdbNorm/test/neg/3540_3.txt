i truly was disappointed by this film which i had high hopes for. it seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time (including mgm's own "libeled lady", which featured two of the same stars) and the success of william powell and myrna loy. three years into their pairing, they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's "libeled lady" and the two "thin man" movies they had done prior to this. "double wedding" tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, myrna loy, who is intent on dominating the life of her sister (florence rice), future brother-in-law (john beal), and her own servants (which include sidney toler and mary gordon). when the independent spirited william powell comes into her life, having distracted rice and beal from loy's constant control, loy meets her match. sounds good so far, right? yeah, an interesting premise falls short, sad to say, because loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. it's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading, something hollywood did often during its golden age. when loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.<br /><br />fortunately, other than powell, there is free-spirited jessie ralph on board. a salty wealthy older woman who helped loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with powell and can see immediately through loy's cool claims that she loathes him. rice and beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of powell getting between them is senseless. then, an ex-wife of powell's shows up, which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people try to get into powell's tiny trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (it is funny though, that powell keeps getting hit by items meant by loy to hit edgar kennedy with; those chuckles are most welcome, since there are so few others.) powell and loy would do better in two later screwball comedies, "i love you again" and "love crazy", which are sophisticated, witty, and fun. this film attempts to be all three, but ends up a sophisticated bore.
