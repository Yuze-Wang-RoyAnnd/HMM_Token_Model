i know...i know: it's difficult (if not paradoxical) for there to be such a thing as "believable" fantasy. but, to me, there is also such a condition wherein too much unbelievability interfere's with, or distracts from my overall opinion of the movie. the latter was the case for me with regard to goliath awaits. not only did i have too many unanswered questions concerning the storyline, but some of the acting, too, i thought, was a bit over-the-top. (maybe, though, it was the writing: asking them to recite too many trite, predictable, cliched (over-?) reactions.) others have said enough about the plot. i just wish that it was done - and, i think that it could have been - more convincingly. p. s.: this is a fresh comment about this film - i just finished watching it a couple of minutes ago; not a recollection from years ago.
