this is a very strange product from hollywood. apparently it didn't test well because actors who have footage in the credits have been edited completely out of the movie, which means a hasty cut job was done on it. it feels like it was wrestled out of the usually competent demme's hands, and just thrown away. on the other and it is so totally lacking in substance that maybe nothing could save it. it has no real center, either narratively or time wise. although it says the running time is 92 minutes, i seem to recall it ending abruptly, around the 80 minute mark. it's over before it even gets going. it's pretty much laugh free.<br /><br />the merits of the "matthew modine picture" were as elusive then as the luke wilson picture is now.
