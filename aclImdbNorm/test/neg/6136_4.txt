jumpin' butterballs, this movie stinks! it's a dull and listless drag that never lets up. it's a wonder anyone even bothered to make groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache, as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore. chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his italian accent.<br /><br />only harpo provides a grin or two, and there's precious little of that to go around here anyway. figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious co-comic in frank albertson, and the road gets even bumpier. <br /><br />a real misfire.
