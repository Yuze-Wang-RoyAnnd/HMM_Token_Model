i own a vacation lake home not far from plainfield, wi. ten minutes from the gein property to be exact. i've seen his land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he did his digging, and i've shopped at the hardware store that was formerly owned by the worden family. while visiting relatives in california, we decided to rent this movie. it was disgusting. the true story of ed gein is so disturbing and creepy, why the creators of this piece of trash decided to make up their own story is beyond me. the actor playing ed is a very large man, ed was a very small, meek, and shy man. that is part of what makes his story so frightening. he did not have a helper to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with a little dirt in it. you won't break much of a sweat digging a hole. they didn't have to hire an actor with the physique of a wrestler, just do your research. and if the writing wasn't bad enough - there are no mountains in wisconsin, and i'm pretty certain that 911 was not available in 1957.
