i can find no redeeming value to this movie. it appears to be loosely based on the lion king school of thought. father gets killed, son can't fill the shoes and tries to run away, etc, etc, etc. the only difference (other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle) is that barnyard tries to "liven things up" with club-type music. they go way over the top in trying to be cool. the problem is that it really isn't cool. it's like "that guy". everybody knows at least one of "those guys" who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth. they try to be cool to fit in but they really aren't. that's this movie.<br /><br />but hey, if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of you life away, by all means don't let me stop you.
