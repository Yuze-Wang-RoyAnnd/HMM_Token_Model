i watched this movie about six years ago and i recently did so again. if i remember correctly i did not like it at all the first time and i appreciated it slightly more this second time.<br /><br />this movie is obviously on a big budget. the effects are mostly top notch (except for one or two "impacts") and the cast is impressive. however, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show.<br /><br />firstly, whoever decided that peter stormare should act as a crazy russian astronaut should be fired. being a swede and a fan of peter, i'm pretty sure he can play a russian character well. but his performance in this case is plain stupid, both with respect the lines uttered and the acting. so... something must be wrong with the script. i'd like to see peter as a professional russian astronaut instead.<br /><br />secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch. it is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath. in addition to this, the events that unfold are simply not credible. i'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie.<br /><br />finally, the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too action-biased. the shuttles are maneuvering like if they were a couple of migs, at zero safety distance, while bouncing off car-sized ice blocks like ping-pong balls. the director should watch apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecraft like these.<br /><br />i like the music score because it is dramatic to a degree making it very touching. the overall performance of the actors is great. apart from the things mentioned above the story is interesting and quite easy to follow.<br /><br />with some minor changes this would have been a 8/10 movie. i'm sorry it isn't!
