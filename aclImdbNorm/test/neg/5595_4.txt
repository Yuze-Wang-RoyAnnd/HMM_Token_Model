1st watched 2/9/2008, 4 out of 10(dir-j.s. cardone): sexual political thriller that doesn't really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting soft-core scenes. the movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy. the couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman that's willing to be a part of a three-some and fulfill some of their fantasies. at this point, we only know that this couple is well off but we don't know until they return that the fianc'e is part of a well-to-do political family. the man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage. they then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their qwest begins as to how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want, and how to clear their names before any of this gets out. this qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time, to the point where their friends & family wonder what they're doing all day and why they look rundown all the time. this movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride. this mistake, of course, keeps the movie going. the performances are fine despite the no-name cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become ho-hum about  1/2  the way through. and of course, they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prior(as is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to spice up the movie). this doesn't help this movie one bit, though.
