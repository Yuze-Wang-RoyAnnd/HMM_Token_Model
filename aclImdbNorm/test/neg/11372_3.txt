this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch. i just don't like that so-called "realistic" camera work that is being done nowadays; you know the type- jumping off center, panning around, etc. what got me particularly irritated about this film though was the new thing that they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene. i believe that the film would have been much better if the camera work was shot in the much more conventional way because as it was i couldn't concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the camera work instead. maybe if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this the filmmakers will finally get the hint.
