what this film has is its realism , you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style . however the problem is unless you`re a big fan of the sport there`s not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention .<br /><br />before anyone asks why i watched it , i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but that`s not really a good enough reason for watching
