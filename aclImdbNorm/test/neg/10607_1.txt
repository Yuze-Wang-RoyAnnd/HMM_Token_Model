pure crap, decent cinematography... i liked some of colors. other than that, this was one of the worst movies i ever saw. boring, lifeless, not once did i find myself interested in any of the characters. i kept waiting for a real plot to form and the movie to pick up the pace. nothing ever happened! i think they spent too much time working on hair and wardrobe that they forgot there was a movie being made at the time.
