i'd chose either over this film. this film has been in my "must see" list for a while because people talked about it being "disturbing" and also the vhs box contains lots and lots of quotes from people saying how "amazing" it is, or how "as close as you can get to texas chainsaw massacre" and lines like that. but, sorry folks, i was disappointed big time. the idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes a mistaken creation of evolution and people do indeed to the dumbest films in the film.<br /><br />that, in turn, takes away any credibility that the plot may have otherwise had. i couldn't believe how unnecessarily loooooong some "where is he, let's find him" sequences were. a few gory moments to please the gore fan, but they are so few that by the time we get to them there's no point. if luther's a geek, then the filmmakers must really be down on the food chain.
