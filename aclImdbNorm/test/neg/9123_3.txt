i really don't think producer george lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as "more american graffiti" turned out to be. but in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. coming straight off the huge success of "american graffiti" and produced basically at the same time as "star wars", this film was the first that lucas successfully took away from coppola without having to bother directing it himself. the result is typical lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. the writer/director bill norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. while it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.<br /><br />lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical "last big night" before school ends and kurt (ron dreyfuss) and steve (ron howard) are supposed to go off to college. one thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. there's a disposition of time, like in nick ray's "rebel without a cause" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. "more american graffiti" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with toad (charles martin smith) off in vietnam, his former girlfriend debbie (candy clark) partying with hippies in san francisco, steve and laurie (cindy williams) involved in student protests in berkeley, and john miler (paul le mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. in a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch john race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original. instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time, just seeing various events on new years eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. it's easy for the audience to become confused, and i think it's fair to say that we do. while the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film.<br /><br />the best parts of the movie to me are the ones with candy clark in sf and charles martin smith in nam. some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other. a good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better, and if the other parts weren't such a drag. speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and throwing in mackenzie phillips for a cameo didn't help at all. it was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why curt isn't in the movie because he's already in canada. instead laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. there's a black kind of satire to some of the vietnam stuff, very similar to what i would imagine lucas and john milius' original idea for "apocalypse now" would have been like. and there's some of that manic fun in the san francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. but still along with that fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if anyone wants to see steve and laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. i think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful, it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything. it just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freeze frame imitation of "two-lane blacktop" and so many better films.<br /><br />like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable. the performances by country joe and the fish are great, and scott glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with candy clark is a sight to see -- i wonder if even back then he had to use a wig? i couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has some small affection in my heart because i love the original so much. every couple of decades i guess i have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as i remember it being. it's a party killer but it's something that every fan of "american graffiti" or george lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. it shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. it makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that lucas actually made such a good movie as "american graffiti" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for bill norton.
