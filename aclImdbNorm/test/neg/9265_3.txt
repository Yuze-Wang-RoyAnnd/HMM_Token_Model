i acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it i found that even the mighty imdb didn't have it listed. that should have been all i needed to know.<br /><br />with friends like these is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate twilight zone / outer limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film. of the three stories, the only one that i gleaned any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man (of sorts) grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge. this episode wins points for a few spots of humour and it's bizarre premise. other than that there is an episode with a talking car (bland and directionless) and an episode where a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog guessed the ending of this one).<br /><br />as has been mentioned in other comments, the 18 rating is entirely unwarranted. there is nothing to offend here. if you're after a good horror anthology check out asylum or the creepshow films instead.
