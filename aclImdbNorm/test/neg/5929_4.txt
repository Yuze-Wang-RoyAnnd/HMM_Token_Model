purportedly this is the final film of the left behind series which is fundamentalist preacher and novelist tim lahaye's idea of what we can expect in our future in the final days of planet earth. if this is the case we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if barack obama becomes president next year.<br /><br />the fantastic four of revelation are all back with one cast change, arnold pinnock who most would know as the guidance counselor in life with derek, is now the minister taking the place of clarence gilyard. brad johnson as the anti-christ's pilot by day and christian by night is there as his daughter janaya stephens and ace investigative reporter kirk cameron. these are the only four people on earth who have divined the true nature of un secretary general nicolai karpathy and once again are throwing sand in his machinery.<br /><br />this time they've got as an ally the president of the united states who is played by louis gossett, jr. he's having one hell of a rough time, especially the guerrillas launch on rpg attack on a presidential motorcade killing vice president charles martin smith. that's right, the toad is vice president. somebody really messed up bad here because everyone including those who would do them harm know a president and vice president never travel together. <br /><br />it takes all of them the entire film to convince gossett exactly who karpathy really is. once again the best one in the film is gordon currie as karpathy.<br /><br />we may yet see another left behind film yet, the door was left open though people assure me that they've run out of source material from tim lehaye. i suppose as long as they make money and these players can't get jobs in the mainstream film industry. and there are some unresolved plot issues involving brad johnson and chelsea noble who is mrs. kirk cameron in real life. <br /><br />one of the fantastic four does die in this film, so will it be the fantastic three or will they get another fourth. stay tuned.
