i should know better. i've seen too many of rob lowe's early work to expect anything good from this movie, even if it is about hockey.<br /><br />here we have, yet again, another tired sports theme. kid has potential for greatness, has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesn't screw things up. and, boom, he comes out of it as that helluva player kind of champion. is that all that can be said of sports movies? surely, there must be other feats that athletes undertake.<br /><br />nonetheless, this movie has got to be one of the biggest cheeseballs. everybody's interactions are just downright silly, and not in a stupid-funny kind of manner. and i can't think of any ancillary qualities that could enliven my position. not the actors (certainly not swayze who plays lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music, and very little from the skating sequences. <br /><br />normally, i'm a sucker for 80s movies, even if they do tend to be a little fishy (i.e. north shore, the karate kid), but this doesn't even make for good 80s trash. for a good 80s sports movie, check elsewhere. there's plenty of them out there.
