when a friend and i saw this in the recent releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before. we both like costas mandylor and it had james coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad. we were wrong. it was. it was really that bad. no actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. it was like taking titanic, the poseidon adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.<br /><br />i must admit that there were a couple of chuckles. i did laugh when the head cabin boy is asking alan (costas mandylor) if he's some "pussy marine." the other laughs this film got though had nothing to do with the writing. i would dearly love to know how the people making this movie thought that you could have a cruise liner knocked upside down and have it remain steady. it isn't tipped or anything.<br /><br />if you are looking for something to watch for costas mandylor, james coburn or any of the rest of this cast, move on. find something good that they did.
