'a new generation' is the third amityville entry to base its plot around writer john g. jones's premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. first a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. however, this is also the first amityville since 'the possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. this time around, keyes terry (robert partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named franklin bronner (sonny montelli in 'amityville ii') murdered his entire family. unfortunately for terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood.<br /><br />this 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'it's about time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. <br /><br />however, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. one of the biggest weaknesses of the amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. on the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*.<br /><br />there's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. or maybe it's just tedious anyway. director john murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. there were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. if they don't take it too seriously, why should we?<br /><br />which is a shame, because 'a new generation' has a more-than-capable cast. i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name 'julia nickson' in the credits. she captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, i was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. terry o'quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while i'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing ibsen.<br /><br />the sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. clearly, murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all.<br /><br />'a new generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. however, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'the possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.
