no, it's just a cheap 1940s serial using the cap's good name. if you are a fan of the comic book, you will be greatly disappointed. they have radically changed the character. no shield, no bucky, no fighting the nazis, no wings on the side of his mask and most importantly: captain america is now a district attorney and no longer a gi.<br /><br />dick purcell as captain america? don't look too closely when he changes into his costume. it is pretty obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he made this serial(can you say flabby?). it is also very obvious that a stunt man is performing most of the action here. almost every chapter has an obligatory fist fight that is shot and performed in exactly the same way. the villain is rather bland and although he uses an alias (the scarab), he doesn't wear a disguise of any kind. the story is repetitive and very simple. the effects are laughable and the action is average. on the plus side we have sexy lorna gray as the d.a.'s assistant and the good captain gets to ride on a cool looking motorcycle in one early chapter. overall ok but nothing special.
