this film has a premise that is good enough to get anyone talking, and a sure-fire conversation starter. 'would you sleep with someone you dislike or don't know for one million dollars?' while the film had lots of potential, poor execution turns it into a b-grade soap-opera. the film has a great lead up, and after the proposal is made, we are really into the film, but then it falls dramatically. the last 3 quarters of the film is spent by characters whinging, complaining and regretting what they have done! the ending was so cliched it had me in tears! this has a very similar premise to 'honeymoon in vegas' which is far better. see that instead.
