you know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh? half-caste wasn't one of them. which sounds good, right? but no, it's not. it's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that's fun to watch because it's lame, or not well acted, or has bad special effects or anything else like that. no, half-caste is just plain boring. they don't even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so. it's just kids running around in the african bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75% of the movie, and it's not even funny. the last 20 minutes, though, are hilarious. i have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to watch that cgi leopard rip out the throats of all of those white guys i couldn't tell apart anyway. if you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, don't rent this one, because you'll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff. if you do accidentally rent this movie, i'd recommend fast forwarding to the end, and skipping any scene that happens in daylight. you won't miss anything. you won't have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the back-story.
