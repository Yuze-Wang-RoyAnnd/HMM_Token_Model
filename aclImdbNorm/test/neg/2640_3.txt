in a quiet town a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named milo, who lives on the other side of town. after the murder, his body is found in a river and his pronounced dead. so sixteen years later a weddings draws the girls back to their childhood town and claire a school teacher becomes obsessed that milo hasn't died as she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims milo is apart of it. so now, she sets off to find out the horrifying truth.<br /><br />when i came across this film, i was pretty sceptical about it, especially when it had "from the creators of anaconda" on the front cover, but reading the odd little plot outline on the back of the video case, it sounded alright and rather refreshing for a change. well, guess what? i thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the film. it just seemed to try to hard to be smart and very psychological based, but that latter element didn't come off that well for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller. hey, i'll admit it had its moments, but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling, or memorable. but, a bravo to the filmmakers, at least the story isn't a rehash of those slasher imitators that followed "scream" and shock horror, there's no self-referential humour evident
