"wired" would have to rate as one of the ten worst films i have ever seen. the writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and i'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film.<br /><br />it fails to work either as a tribute to belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. <br /><br />a pointless mess with no redeeming features.
