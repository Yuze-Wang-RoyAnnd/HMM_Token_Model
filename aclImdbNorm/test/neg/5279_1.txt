low budget "films" like this just give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter. in other words, if there are people out there who are willing to finance a piece of schlock like this, than there's certainly much more than a glimmer of hope for someone like myself who can actually write stories. this film is right up there, or should i say "down there" with the ed wood's of the world. the story, if you can call it that, and the dialog, not to mention the sophomoric acting, is a travesty toward the genre itself. someone should have driven a stake through this stinker while it was still just on paper. it follows that since literature has pretty much been killed off, that film should follow. in order to have a good or even just passable movie, you must have at the very least decent writing. the legendary curt siodmak springs to mind. they used a lot of his stories for low budget films way back when but they still come off today as good, serious entertainment, i.e. "donavan's brain". the cast for this "work" should seriously consider going back to work at their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forget about any future feeble attempts at appearing in front of a camera. avoid this one like the plague itself!!!
