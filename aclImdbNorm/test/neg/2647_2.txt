back in the dark days of 1990, the hoped-for heir to the spielberg throne (after the failure of supposed whiz-kid phil joanou) was mistakenly believed to be pretentious spielberg wannabe david mickey evans. evans managed to fleece the studios for over a million dollars, suckering baby-boomer executives into believing his screenplay -- a combination of nostalgic, 1960s references and a disturbing drama about child abuse -- somehow equaled good storytelling, and a decent film. <br /><br />as rod stewart once sang, "look how wrong you can be."<br /><br />but the novice's artsy-fartsy, "e.t."-inspired script convinced enough people he was the next chosen one -- the new spielberg -- and so a deal was struck to not only buy the script for more money than 99 percent of the world's population will ever see in their lifetime, but for evans to direct the film as well -- even though he'd had never directed anything in his life. <br /><br />hey, how hard can it be to be another film-making genius, after all?<br /><br />two weeks into the shoot, columbia found out. his dailies were called "totally unusable" by the studio -- or at least those level-headed enough to not to have fallen under the e.n.c. (emperor's new clothes) spell. all his footage was scrapped and recycled into guitar pics.<br /><br />so what's a studio to do after sinking 10 or 20 million dollars into something they still believed represented the resurrection of steven spielberg? hire spielberg himself to save the day? columbia probably tried that.<br /><br />enter old pro richard donner. hey, he may not be a cinematic genius, but he gets the job done. "superman" wasn't too bad, after all -- and the first "lethal weapon" was pretty good.<br /><br />so donner steps in and grabs the directorial reins. fortunately he manages to convince columbia that the worst of the film's insipid fantasy sequences -- which would have played out like a ten year-old's acid trip -- have to go. unfortunately, he leaves in the crying buffalo (ooh, how poetic) and the ridiculous, pseudo-spielberg fantasy ending, complete with clueless mom perfectly content for the rest of her life to get postcards from her missing son as he circles the globe in his red wagon. right.<br /><br />but donner did manage to get a decent performance out of elijah wood. and lorraine bracco as the idiot mom wasn't bad either. maybe donner should be reevaluated. maybe he's not such a phony hollywood hack as everyone has always believed.<br /><br />the only reason i'm giving this over-baked misfire a 2 rating is that someone was smart enough to cast the great john heard (but in the wrong part, of course). the kids do okay... though tom hanks' horrible, overly-explanatory narration nearly destroys every scene it intrudes upon.<br /><br />one might think that after the david mickey evanses and phil joanous and troy duffys of the world, the studios might finally wise up. one might hope that these hype-driven film-making debacles might prevent the emperor's new clothes syndrome from ever rearing its ugly head again.<br /><br />doubtful!
