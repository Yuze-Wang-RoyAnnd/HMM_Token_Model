this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel "in the electric mist of the confederate dead". it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the miscasting of the principal players. tommy lee jones, a normally fine actor, just doesn't capture burke's "dave robicheaux". as robicheaux's main nemesis, john goodman does a sloppy job as the "heavy". the guy who plays robicheaux's actor-buddy doesn't look like a former "a" lister leading man. the rest of the movie is mainly cast with no-name locals who just don't do justice to a big-time novel.<br /><br />the movie and jones' performance is way too hurried for one thing. robicheaux in burke's series of novels, gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time, being laid back and slow-moving. this is just like the deep south and southern louisiana. then at times robicheaux is nearly manic in his exertions. jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie. he doesn't vary. ned beatty is wasted. mary steenburgen is out of place. about the only good thing about this is the setting. on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie.
