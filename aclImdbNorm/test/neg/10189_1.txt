after a good start, it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than thou propaganda i've ever seen. this movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the "holy bible".<br /><br />to resume the...ok let's call it a plot... basically alien don't abduct people (that we already know..). no, in fact its demonic forces abducting people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft, or read porno magazine (as one protagonist does).<br /><br />it's complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must blindly follow christ to be saved.<br /><br />a quote sums it all , imagine a subtle piano music in the background : "you can't let others, even those you love, stop you from following the lord.."<br /><br />and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age...still work to do. boycott this piece of crap
