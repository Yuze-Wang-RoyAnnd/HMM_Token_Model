bette midler is the best thing about this movie. it is a poor second to the original from 1962 with natalie wood as gypsy. the songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better. bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to cynthia gibb. only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie.<br /><br />there was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl. when natalie wood was gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. when she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant, it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star, not just a poor substitute to her sister. and the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through. it was an important part of the movie and they butchered it. it is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. it was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie. i was completely disappointed and had it not been for bette midler i would have shut the movie off.
