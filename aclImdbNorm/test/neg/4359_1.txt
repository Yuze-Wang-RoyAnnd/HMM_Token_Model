suburban kids meet the forest. killjoy is better in this part. he is more wicked and stronger as well. nevertheless, most part of the acting is bad as well, like in the first one. sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing. i made an error to watch this one sober. you'll probably enjoy it more if you are not ;-). if you did not already stop loving clowns after the first movie, you definitely will after the second.....;-)<br /><br />problem kids and their watchers are on their way to a camp in the forest. and what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of a forest and.....at night? that's just their luck. they find a house and one got shot, one of the watchers stays behind (why i do not know) and the rest eventually finds another house. in that house a voodoo priestess lives.....but she is not responsible for the resurrection of killjoy. who is it then? well, you better watch the movie and find out for yourselves....
