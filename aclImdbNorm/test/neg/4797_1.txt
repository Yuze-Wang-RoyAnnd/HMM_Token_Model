i went to see this film over matchstick men, in fact buying the tickets to matchstick men and going to the other, because it looked like a fun movie with action, romance, thrills, jungles, and exotic locations. they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of story.<br /><br />all i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight narrative instead of some sappy flashback story.<br /><br />here is all the movies from what i've seen the film was derived from: of course, indiana jones and romancing the stone, but also true lies, proof of life, that old 80s tom selleck movie, bananas (woody allen), and hero (from the use of digital extras).<br /><br />ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.
