the brands in this film, like suit supply, take away from the story, cause it's supposed to be set in the eighties. it's not a very thrilling film. also, the single from intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times', like "i'm a cruel man, i take it all away, i'm a cruel man i'm here to stay.." jeeez couldn't those asswipes have come up with something better than that? i guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes..<br /><br />it's really annoying, just like the product placement in this filmproduct,that cashes in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be, but should be forgotten like rats ought to be.
