i had high expectations going into this film, but alas, i feel let down. i bought it for 5 bucks at a used vhs place, and the version i bought was the english dubbed version. the dubbing is awful, so beware. "lola" just wasn't as good in this film as in "run lola run", and the bad guy just kinda came out of nowhere. and "lola" starts to catch on to what's going on the second she gets to the university. seems unrealistic to me. i was also wondering if in the original version there were american songs in the soundtrack... they seemed extremely out of place. too bad for this film, i really thought it was going to rock.
