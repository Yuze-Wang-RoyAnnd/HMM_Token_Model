this movie is not so good as i thought it would be. there is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. the gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. it starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. the music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. they should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. and some more info about the morticians would have made this movie far scarier than it is. don't expect a scary movie but a nice, gory special effects reel.
