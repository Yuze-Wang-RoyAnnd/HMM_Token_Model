this is jonas quastel debut as a director and to be honest, it shows. it looks like he threw in every type of camera trick that he learned in film school to try and add some style to a badly written script, which he helped write! film has lance henriksen and a group of others searching the pacific northwest for a plane that crashed that his daughter was on and also a special machine his company has built that he wants to also retrieve. the first 5 minutes of the film is either blurry or shaky or out of focus! quastel tries to capture the "blair witch" mode with these type of shots and they grow tiresome very quickly. and there is also the pov shots that are right from "wolfen" and "predator". these shots are from the point of view (pov) of the sasquatch. the editing is very choppy at times as a scene seems to shift right in the middle. i have heard this film was shot in about 12 days and i suppose instead of "starting back to one" they just restarted without stopping and edited the scene together. and the rest of the film is fade-outs from one scene to another. they're are so many scenes that fade-out that i lost count. now, the nude scene with andrea roth. its not her. you can easily see its a body double. and you know your watching a bad "b" movie when in the middle of the pacific northwest a hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe! ********spoiler alert********<br /><br />and the sasquatch himself is not bad when you don't really see him and he's just a blurry image behind some trees or bushes but when you finally see him at the end your of course disappointed. first of all, he's not that tall. the actor who is playing sasquatch is only hairy in certain spots on his body. its a partial suit! and he's bald! i have heard that a make-up person died during filming and maybe that explains why the costume looks hastily made. some of the sound effects that are coming from the sasquatch are nothing more than the familiar lion roars that we have all heard in other films. i do have to admit that henriksen is not to bad. yes, he's working with bad material but he has one of those interesting faces that can actually enhance certain moments of the film. people keep saying that a good bigfoot film has never been made but i disagree. i have always said that "the creature from black lake" is a good film and i highly recommend that one. i'm a sucker for a sasquatch film but this one is just to amateurish.
