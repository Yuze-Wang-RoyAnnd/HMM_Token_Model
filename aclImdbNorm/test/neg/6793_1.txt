this show is the worst show ever! norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc etc. the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain? no trees, no building, just whoosh.....thin air. he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. no co star ever gets the glory. its all norris. its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content. terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.
