geesh, i never, ever, ever thought i'd write the above four words. but, actually, she's the highpoint of this little flick.<br /><br />as the movie was packaged when i rented it, it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication, which keeps her stable. it sounded like a cute concept. for years, all we ever saw of spelling was as donna martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull, lifeless tv movies. it sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little, and considering that with her tv success and her rich daddy, she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie, i figured she took the part because this must be a low-budget jewel.<br /><br />wrong.<br /><br />instead, spelling's part is small, and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines. when she's not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly, i could've sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. this would've worked so much better if spelling's storyline had dominated, and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and phil, the least irritating kidnapper.
