god, did i hate this movie! i saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago, and i still have bad flashbacks. it was, without a doubt, the worst movie i ever paid to see. it was badly written, badly directed, and (surprisingly considering the cast) badly acted. i would rather be thrown off a rooftop onto razor sharp spikes, and then have my skin peeled off, than to sit through it again. can you guess i didn't enjoy it?
