this movie was pathetically awful. the sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. if you have a life don't see this movie, cause you will want to kill yourself. this movie totally rips off blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie...or trilogy i should say).<br /><br />i don't care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. i watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is. i actually don't know why my family is still watching it...oh wait, yes i do. they are laughing almost non-stop at the stupid action, dialogue and acting.
