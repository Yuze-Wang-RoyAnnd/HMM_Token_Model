what a terrible movie! it represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of french society, where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared. the plot is nonsensical, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting. to say the least, the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired. catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was, even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour. the rest of the usually good cast (vincent lindon, line renaud, jean yanne) seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james ivory's "le divorce", with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores, its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use. having watched "le divorce" you can feel a kind of empathy with the french, regardless of their foibles. "belle-maman" leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.
