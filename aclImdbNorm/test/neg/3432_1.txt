i have to say, krasinski is the only reason i even watched this film. he is good. however, everything else about this film is so far below average that it's not worth the time and effort spent viewing this film.<br /><br />this film has loads of technical/aesthetic issues: namely, shot selections, framing, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely bad editing (probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shots), and overall terrible acting (except for krasinski).<br /><br />it was far too theatrical (in acting and presentation) to develop any sort of suspenseful moment in this film...which is surprising, because it's all about a bank robbery, which should be at least somewhat exciting.<br /><br />how does a film this bad get made, and then released, and then distributed?<br /><br />kind of reminds me of a c- film student's thesis project, probably not even that good though.
