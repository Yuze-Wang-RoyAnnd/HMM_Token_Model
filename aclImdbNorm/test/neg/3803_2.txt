i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels. i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, "groovy" haircuts aside, and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? having not seen the original, i guessed it might be the poseidon adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in distress. was i wrong! i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash. there is no story, the performances all looked forced, the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.<br /><br />it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as sally field, michael caine, et al. they must have needed the money badly. can we blame the director?
