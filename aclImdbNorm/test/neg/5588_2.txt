wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me? nothing other than a questionable "sequel" to 8mm. it wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an american diplomat, david huxley, and his fianc'ee, tish harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest, hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, risa. the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. the mystery is solved when, in the end, tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fianc'ee which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />i didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all. the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. otherwise, its a totally different movie. it made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn't believe the words coming out of david's mouth the whole time. but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the "shocking" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this "hellish" sex debauchery. i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative.<br /><br />david was no heroic person throughout the film. you could guess he was the main problem long before the end. the actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting "respect." there were plot holes (how did david and richard finally impress tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) there were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character. the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath. nobody really dies. but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />go rent (and maybe buy) the original. it's one of joel schumacher's better and more original films. it has everything better about it from this film. i wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
