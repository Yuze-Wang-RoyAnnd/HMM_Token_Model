christian propaganda...lots of fear mongering...<br /><br />this is not scifi, this is chrifi (christian fiction).the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn. from then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . the ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.<br /><br />the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture. the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction, instead of god taking all the christians to heaven. no reason to repent if its aliens. the deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose.
