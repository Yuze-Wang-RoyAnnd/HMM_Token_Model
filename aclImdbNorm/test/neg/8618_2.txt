this movie "vampires: the turning" isn't even really worth the 2 out of 10 i'm giving it. the movie, is very predictable from beginning, up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers. the use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second, though it never did. the acting, was b-rank at best... and the movie was just, dull. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story, had potential though it ended up unable to deliver. oh, and did i mention the wardrobe? the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to "non-existent" because our hero, and his girlfriend (whom he's trying to save throughout the entire movie) wear the same outfits through the entire movie. i'd suggest this film only if your really bored, and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry. ~dave, the horror cowboy
