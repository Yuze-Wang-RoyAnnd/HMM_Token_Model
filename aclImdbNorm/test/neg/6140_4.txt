i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead. i only saw one other play in the 1970's-1990's that had an emotional impact like this play did. i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn't reprise her role in the film--she wasn't well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead. sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way. i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role. the movie plot was true to the play. anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind.
