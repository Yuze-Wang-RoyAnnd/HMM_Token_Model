the film begins with a little girl (rita) seeing her father killed. he apparently was a criminal who squealed on his fellow crooks. later, and this part makes little sense, the girl has grown to adulthood and still her father's past haunts her! a bit later, rita meets a good-for-nothing and dates him. during one of their dates, he's a bit intoxicated and driving like a total fool. the cops give chase and he speeds away--killing a pedestrian in the meantime. here comes the really stupid part. he convinces her to confess to the crime, as he assures her his lawyers can get her off scot-free. why, oh why, would she agree to this?! yet she does and spends the next couple years in prison!! and, soon after her conviction, this boyfriend disappears--showing that he's a total heel. what a chump!!! later, after her release, her friend (jack la rue) informs her about the truth about the boyfriend. then, he explains, the boyfriend's family is loaded and she should shake them down for lots of cash for all the trouble he put her to by taking the rap. frankly, this does make sense--as they certainly owe it to her--especially since they knew she'd go to prison and had every intention of using her and then casting her aside.<br /><br />now the idea of bleeding money from the rich chumps is a good plot idea. however, there is no way this would have occurred in the first place because it's hard to believe anyone could be so stupid as to take the rap for a hit-and-run! in an interesting twist, the dumb lady decides on a life of crime--donning a wig and picking up a rich guy--taking him into the desert and robbing him at gunpoint! wow...how she's changed! apparently she loves the idea of stealing from "phonies"--i.e., rich hypocrites. however, and this made no sense, she soon stopped doing this and began shaking down the father of the old boyfriend--why she bothered to do some petty robberies in the meantime made little sense. and, what also was a bit hard to believe was that instead of wanting money from the old jerk, she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mob-controlled man for mayor. odd...very, very odd.<br /><br />in the meantime, another plot develops involving a young alan ladd. he's an undercover agent who has infiltrated the mob. he was chosen because he just happens to be a dead ringer for a real crook--what a clich'e! but what makes no sense is that this real crook isn't in jail and is out committing crimes while the fake one is infiltrating the mob in another town.<br /><br />eventually, evidence that ladd is able to uncover is enough to issue warrants to the mob kingpins--including rita. this is a case of very bad timing, as in the interim, she's made a decision to become a decent and legitimate woman, as she's met a really nice guy who she wants to marry! wow,...what are the odds?! overall, this is a goofy and rather dumb movie that suffers from "kitchen sink syndrome"--in other words, there is way too many plot elements and weird twists to make the movie the least bit believable. plus, since the movie is only a little over an hour long, it all seems very forced and contrived. it's a relatively bad b-movie from crap-studio prc of note only for the performance of alan ladd just before he gained great fame the following year at paramount.<br /><br />by the way, this dvd was released by alpha video---a company which sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles (mostly public domain) but which never cleans up the prints or adds closed captions. in other words, the dvd production values are strictly 3rd-rate...at best.
