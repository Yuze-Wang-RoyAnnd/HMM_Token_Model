this film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband through suicide. she is tormented by her son who refused to speak after that.<br /><br />child grief is rarely explored on film, so it is refreshing to see a film like addison's wall. however, due to the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. apart from a few key emotional moments, everything in the film is very plain. the abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable. addison's wall could have been much better, such as exploration of the contents of the wall, a more intensive care program to help addison to go through his trauma. instead, the film feels very unfinished and non engaging.
