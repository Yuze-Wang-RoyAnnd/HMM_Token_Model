i cringed when i heard the first canned laugh track in the first few seconds of the show but yet i gave it a chance. you know when someone offers a line which is only slightly amusing and you hear an obviously fake laugh track explode in uproarious laughter that it's a show aimed at morons who need to be told "yes, it's funny, go ahead and laugh".<br /><br />ugh. i couldn't stand this show as it revealed itself. i can't speak for everyone - after all some people actually like that idiotic show "stacked" (which makes me wish to vomit). i can imagine those who like "stacked" might actually like this drivel, too. some people still get a kick out of the old "pull my finger" gag. to me, this show is just about as witty - and just about as original.<br /><br />the themes were old and tired. the jokes were lame and hackneyed. the characters were ones we've seen everywhere before - and the worst of any you might imagine.<br /><br />so... if you like things like burping words and neighbors who say "pull my finger"... you might actually like this show. otherwise... pass it by. it's stupid - and not in a clever or original way. this one is about as old and tired as any show has ever been at its premiere.
