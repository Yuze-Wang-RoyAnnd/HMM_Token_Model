this might not have been as horribly bad as it was if not for the absolutely awful acting job done by raymond wallace! this guy is so bad it wasn't even funny! his character was needed in the film, but why they chose this guy is beyond me. <br /><br />if you're looking for some quality chinese films.....might i suggest "raise the red lantern"...."the story of qui ju"...."red sorghum"......<br /><br />anything but this! i was surprised at how many people actually rated this highly! really...the acting by this wallace loser is so bad it overshadows the other good parts of this film. this was agreed upon by all 6 of us watching this movie last night!<br /><br />stay clear of this piece of garbage........
