my daughter liked it but i was aghast, that a character in this movie smokes. as if it isn't awful enough to see "product placement" actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies - at least children movies should be more considerate! i wonder: was that intentional? did big tobacco "sponsor" the film? what does it take to ban smoking from films? at least films intended for children and adolescents. my daughter liked it but i was aghast, that a character in this movie smokes. as if it isn't awful enough to see "product placement" actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies - at least children movies should be more considerate! i wonder: was that intentional? did big tobacco "sponsor" the film? what does it take to ban smoking from films? at least films intended for children and adolescents.
