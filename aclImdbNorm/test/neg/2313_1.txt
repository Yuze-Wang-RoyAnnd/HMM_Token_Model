i don't recommend watching this movie. it's a movie in which a movie is being filmed, with no attraction between actress and actor being played. the sex scene at the end of the movie which is to explain the reluctance of the actress (being played in the movie) to cooperate with the actor (being played in the movie)in it is a blunt repetition of the same scene in the breillat movie fat girl. everything there was played with more delicacy, if you can attach delicacy to a sex act like that. a typical french expression for the the thing happening in sex is comedy is oh la la! in breillat's film brief crossing there also is sensitivity. in sex is comedy i don't see real sensitivity and also a clear plot for the movie is not being developed so that there is a rather loose story with the disillusion of the end.
