the plot is simple: an american couple is in vacation in thailand. somehow they are attacked by the 'almighty' chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires. this is ok till now. the girl's partner is left to search for her. and now the horror begins. he comes upon a strange group of semi-vampires or something (they only drank animal blood). these vampires are in conflict with the bad guy for about...800 years. however, with the help of the 'good vampires', the guy begins to search his girlfriend.<br /><br />now the fight scenes begin, what a karate movie without fight? another thing i have noticed is that the vampires are very ugly guys. i mean....a vampire is an old-fashion guy(he is alive since...for ever), he's got style. there are also modern vampires, but in this movie, the vampires are....weird. like, come on, they ride a bike, they are all dressed in leather and they destroy everything in their way.<br /><br />the worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie it is an low budget one. the script is boring and the actors aren't too talented. the music is pretty good, but the effects are not that great.<br /><br />to sum up the movie it is not that great, but if you have a free afternoon, watch it and tell me if i'm right or not.
