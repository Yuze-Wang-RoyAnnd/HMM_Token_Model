i am shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people. they must either be kidding or be totally blind for the art of acting, directing and other flaws of the movie.<br /><br />i must admit that i just could not force myself to sit through the whole movie, it was just too bad.<br /><br />the three first characters, not including the "digger" were just awful actors, and i mean awful! maybe the director didn't care, or may be he is a worse director. it was like watching a bad school play. the movie was of course filmed with a video camera (lowbudget - not real film), and the light settings were not very good either. in addition, the sound man (if they had one) must either have been a newbie or a drunk as the sound were amateurish. even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen (awful acting btw) the sound from the dialog was pretty bad. for example, when the woman moved her head while speaking, you could hear her voice disappear and come back. it sounded like they had tried to correct that in post-production by turning up the volume a bit when she turns her head. in addition, you had the ongoing irritating buzzing sound from either camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. <br /><br />all these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so. need i say more?<br /><br />a good school project or fun project for friends to watch, but should never have been released for a real audience, especially not for a paying audience. this was a rip off unless you have a very low standard regarding movies, or just bad taste. you are warned! sb.
