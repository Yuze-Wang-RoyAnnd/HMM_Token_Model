joan crawford is convincingly disfigured as our story starts, and of course she get fixed up. but she's a bad egg, exploiting one guy, while living out another guy's anti-social philosophy. all of this takes place in sweden, which is truly bizarre. it causes anything and everything memorable in the visuals, which are freed from having to depict anytown usa, but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake since is burdened and rendered unspecific by the need to americanize everything. there is plot, plot, plot so chatty that you could drown in it, and making matters worse is a framing device that adds zilch to the movie. the photography is occasionally nice, with odd angles and miniatures incorporated quite well. but it's overwrought without ever once drawing you in.
