this is without a doubt the worst sequel i have ever seen, & i've seen plenty of them to make that conclusion. the plot is simply ridiculous. i can catch a ball & run around a field, too. why can't i play in the superbowl? yes i know this movie was intended for children, but there are just some plots that even children can realize are totally dumb & unrealistic. the first air bud movie was pretty good, but this one was a total crash. disney is loosing it. if i controlled who won the razzie awards, i would give this one a couple. have a nice day! =)
