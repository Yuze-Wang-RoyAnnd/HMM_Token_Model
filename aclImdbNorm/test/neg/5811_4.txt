i fully agree with the previous reviewer. there's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr, and the focus of the film is on their relationship. hedy lamarr isn't at her best, and spencer tracy appears to be naive, simple and overly-hopeful -- both in love and life; an idealist role that played out best in 'boys town'. if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station...whoa...it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast. not the best acting on anybody's part. miscast and mismatched. story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent. hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself, which is truly the best part of the film. spencer tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film doesn't come off as believable for at least that reason.
