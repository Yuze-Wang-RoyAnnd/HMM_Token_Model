it's a time machine all right. it runs in "real time" for 96 minutes but it felt like 96 years. the first 20 minutes were utterly superfluous. massive amounts of "dead" time throughout. what happened? when will something happen? who cares? apparently the film was made on a tight budget, i note for your edification the following: the morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes from lord of the rings part i, hey? the "scary dude" in charge of controlling the morlochs... the scariest thing these guys could think of was somebody wearing one of gene simmons: (of the band kiss) old costumes??? little-known fact: freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails.<br /><br />save your money, save your time. pass on this one.
