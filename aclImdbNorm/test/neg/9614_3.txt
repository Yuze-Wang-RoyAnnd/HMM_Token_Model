not even 'lesser' hitch, but simply a bad movie. the cinematic equivalent of a dirty-old-man. ugly in every way: unimaginative script, static point of view, putrid clothing, ghastly hair, unlikable actors, and one truly gratuitous rape-and-strangulation scene. the director's perverse sense of humor is present, but it is not applied consistently; the movie comes alive only in its cruelty. the women fare especially badly; 'frenzy' could be used as proof the director was a misogynist, though a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his tv series and 'psycho'- which he himself described as an exercise in thrift, an experiment to see if a television crew could shoot a passable feature -alfred hitchcock had pretty much abandoned art and settled for commerce. in 'frenzy' the great master seems to be bowing to convention, trying to go with the times and give audiences what he thinks they want- in the form of unappealing nudity, nudge-nudge winks, and general nastiness. i don't begrudge an old man his rest, but i don't want to remember him tired and lazy and pandering- time to watch 'vertigo' again!
