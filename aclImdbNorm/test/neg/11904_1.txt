i watched this movie by accident on tv and it was so unbelievably awful i could not switch it off. every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the oscar wilde story by the inept screenplay writer. it barely matters because the dire acting, clich'ed camera-work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway. the worst performance comes from patrick stewart who comes across as the most hammy, talentless, minor mock-shakespearean nincompoop as the ghost. "get thee out of here!" he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain. a truly terrible film and why wonders why stewart, who can act when called upon to do so, has soiled his reputation by making worthless pieces of crap like this and the xmen.
