and again, columbia pictures decides to merely make "hash" using the original version with curly and without any of the gags or jokes to boot! toward the end of this pitiful flick when joe gets stuck riding the bull, the studio didn't even make much of an effort to re-record the sound for if you listen carefully you can still here curly going "woo woo woo woo". also, when moe and larry throw the darts in order to "slow the bull down so he can get off", that's lifted right from the original because you can actually see moe and larry "magically" appear 15 years younger. why oh why did moe allow all this to happen? it's a burning question that probably can never be answered because as far as i know, in real life he was quite sensitive to any type of criticism and had rather high standards for his work, as also did larry, curly and shemp. don't waste your time on this one.
