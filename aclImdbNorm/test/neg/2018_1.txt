dracula 3000 is the epitome of painfully cheesy cinema. from the get-go, i assumed i was in for something pretty nasty. with a cast line up that featured casper van dien, erika eleniak, coolio, and tiny lister, what could be expected? well, let's just say that expectations were crushed...<br /><br />if i really start up, i feel like this review will go on for ages, so we're gonna keep this simple. the vampire isn't even named dracula. the space crew is carrying coffins from the carpathian sector of the transylvania system. in his big scene, coolio speaks of the most horrible things ever spoken of in film history. in the year 3000, everyone wears bad clothes by today's standards, they don't have anything more advanced than a modern wheelchair, and they decorate with neon lights that appear stolen from a roller rink.<br /><br />to top it all off... the ending. sweet merciful god. it doesn't deserve to be ruined. it has to be sen to be believed.<br /><br />i've rated this movie a "1" and i wish i could give it a zero... yet i feel compelled to make you watch it. what madness is this?
