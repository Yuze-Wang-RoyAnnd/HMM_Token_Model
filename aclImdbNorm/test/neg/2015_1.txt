greetings from lithuania.<br /><br />this is the first question that comes to head after watching this "movie". <br /><br />you know, i saw a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching this one, i only had two questions: 1) is this was just a parody (spoof) <br /><br />2) how could people create such a thing!? <br /><br />if you never saw this "film", than you really don't know what is a really bad "film". i mean bad. the script - are you kidding my? acting is so horrible that i thing "the actors" where just having fun in this movie. i know, this is "b" movie, but come on?? is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage?? <br /><br />oh! and what an ending!!! a must miss ending! just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw, wait until the ending - because that kind of ending you have never saw before (and i hope you will never see). <br /><br />awoid this "movie" at any cost, and don't say i didn't warn you...
