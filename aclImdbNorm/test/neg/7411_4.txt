a big waste of time is all you'll get out of this bag. i rented this hoping for a suspenseful movie with maybe a few believable scenes, but boy was i ever dissapointed. i think the title should've been "camping 101", or something to that effect. well, anyway, stay the hell away from this film. it numbs you to death. don't be afraid of big foot, be afraid of this crap!!
