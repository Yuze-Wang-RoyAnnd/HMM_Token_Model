when uwe boll, cinema con man extraordinaire, released the first house of the dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel. hollywood's per-capita ratio of morons must indeed be high, for not only do we have a sequel, it was distributed in the antipodes by sony, a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write-offs. released direct to television in america, the sequel does improve on the original in most respects, but in so doing, it becomes bland rather than interesting. the scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. in particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected denizens can be found. put simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found.<br /><br />the cast, on the other hand, is a real step backward. emmanuelle vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low-rent angelina jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it j"urgen prochnow. in fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is one sticky fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people he faces at home. put simply, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. say what you will about boll, but he at least inspired actors like ona grauer to fight against his ineptitude. that said, the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it. much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. unfortunately, with the actors failing to take their characters or the predicament seriously, what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined.<br /><br />much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. how this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyone's guess, but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own. the we-have-to-go-back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time, but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. we are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes drive back into the university, locate the sample they are looking for, and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of china, all in this space of time. filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension.<br /><br />the special effects used in house of the dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust. where uwe boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, michael hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow. necks are bitten, arms are cut off, heads are shot. it all makes for a much more convincing throughput, but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery. the photography is also much improved. as dvd crypt put it, the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original, but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. the writing is also both an improvement and a setback. throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious being run like hell, are offered. the first couple of times, they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary, everyday dialogue. after the eighth time, however, they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time.<br /><br />interestingly, house of the dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across america. given that tom savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays, i have to say i am somewhat impressed with the visual results. in contrast to the much-reviled original, the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. in a further contrast to the original, the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing. sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people. however, the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already. when aliens, the real dawn of the dead, or the evil dead were released to acclaim, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before, or did it so well that we did not really care. house of the dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it, but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table, so we end up not caring either.<br /><br />for that reason, and many others, i gave house of the dead 2 a two out of ten. it is too good to be bad, but too bad to be any good. unless you are into sucky films as much as i am, you are best to steer clear of it.
