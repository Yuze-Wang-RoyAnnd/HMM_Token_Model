i am sorry folks, but i have to say i really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...<br /><br />when i saw it i looked at my watch to know how much more time i had to spend with this kindergarten nonsense.<br /><br />so why this verdict?<br /><br />first of all: the movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! it is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a quentin tarantino we used to know. this story could have come out of every little kid's head. it doesn't have anything intelligent in it, neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. the rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. doesn't work. even the previously seen cutbacks that tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. <br /><br />second: some guys go to germany and kill nazis. ah really? do they? the only nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. is this the ugly face tarantino wanted to give the nazis? a brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the "basterds"? certainly not --> fail and what happens to the terrible nazi-killing basterds? well they all get killed by nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are...<br /><br />third: any characters? yes one! the only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is chritoph waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. great acting! brad pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by waltz. never seen a such a weak performance by pitt... and the rest? well, some germans you've never seen before and will never see after. when the movie started and i saw the group of the seven basterds i hoped to see something like the "magnificent seven": a group of extraordinary guys, each one with a distinct character, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... i was then very disappointed, when i saw the "inglourious basterds". no details at all, no characters, no real men, just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... but in fact you don't even need to differentiate, cause the "inglourious basterds" except pitt hardly play any role in this movie...<br /><br />so i was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened...
