firstly, i'll admit i haven't seen vampires: los muertos, but i've seen the original vampires film and love it. i rented this film having heard nothing about it. i didn't expect to be impressed. i wasn't.<br /><br />i love the idea of shifting the action to the far east, which should have opened up a lot of new avenues for the action sequences as well as the story line, but not enough was made of this. the fight scenes and the motorbike chases were painfully boring. <br /><br />there were some parts i liked, like the way the slayer team weren't shown as heroic good guys, as they were in the first movie.<br /><br />i'd been hoping since i saw the old hammer movie legend of the 7 golden vampires a few years ago that someone would one day make another good asian-based vampire film. this was not it.
