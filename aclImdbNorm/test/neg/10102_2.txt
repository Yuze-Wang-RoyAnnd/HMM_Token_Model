i just watched this today on tv. it was on abc's sunday afternoon movie.<br /><br />this wasn't a very good movie, but for a low budget independent film like this, it was okay. there is some suspense in it, but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down. the script is pretty lame, and the plot elements aren't very realistic, such as the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder. i don't know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea, but it isn't very realistic.<br /><br />i thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller, because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good, but unfortunately, they never did. there were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this, and in the end, didn't prove to be very creative.<br /><br />if there is something good about this movie, it is the cast. every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with. the terribly underrated actress elizabeth pena was great in this movie. she is very sexy, and has an incredibly sexy voice. however, if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good, watch the excellent animated movie the incredibles. in that movie, she put her sexy voice to good use.<br /><br />what can i say, this movie isn't really worth your time, but the actors were good. unfortunately, they were all wasted on this movie, which is a real shame. this movie tried to be a good suspense thriller, but in the end, it fell flat. if you want to see a good movie that is similar to this, but much better, see the hitcher. if you want to see something with the cast members of this movie, watch any of their other movies. you can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it.
