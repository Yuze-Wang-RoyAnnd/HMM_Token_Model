finally, i can connect the dots between return of the jedi and phantom menace. we see here where lucas lost touch with what made the original star wars films great and began to descend into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1-3. this film is more like one of those cheesy low-budget 80s swords and sorcerer films than anything worthy of being associated with the star wars saga. as with the jar-jar character, this seems targeted at children (and the toy market). the battle scenes are particularly bad. it was depressing to see sian phillips' incredible talent go to such a waste, after her classic performance in i, claudius.
