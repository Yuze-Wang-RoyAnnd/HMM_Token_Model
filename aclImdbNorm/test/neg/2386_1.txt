"the new twenty" is one of the worst films i have ever seen. yes, some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse, but i would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic "indie" film that pretends to be more is worse. <br /><br />"the new twenty" was written and directed by chris mason johnson, and i will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that i wasted on his film.<br /><br />the screenplay & characters<br /><br />from beginning to end, the screenplay failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail. <br /><br />in story telling, the three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man, man vs. the world, and man vs. himself. <br /><br />the screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in new york, and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs. himself, where each of the film's characters are so self-absorbed in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the movie atrophies before the audiences very eyes. <br /><br />each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior (heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict; a fianc'ee who has sex with her fianc'ee's boss/investor, even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character; a man who begins as a decent guy, but is attracted to a foul-mouthed investor, and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foul-mouthed business jackass; a closeted chubby gay cyber geek, who does nothing, but find dates online; and a gay asian man who dates an hiv positive older man, but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops).<br /><br />crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and self- loathing of the fianc'ee that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag; the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a "gordon gecko" type character and become a jackass; a story line for the chubby cyber geek; and more scenes of interaction between the asian man and hiv positive boyfriend are all missing.<br /><br />without proper establishing details, all of the characters' actions seem forced and contrived.<br /><br />direction, cinematography & score<br /><br />i found mr. johnson's direction to be without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /><br />the cinematography can be described as mundane at best. mr. johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of new york city. this failure created a claustrophobic film, that viewed like the filming of a stage play, and not a film.<br /><br />the score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. i assume that mr. johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot.<br /><br />conclusion<br /><br />"the new twenty" is an annoying and unmitigated failure in film-making.
