this film has got so much in it. prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all depicted abundantly..without a single word uttered!!! and how come it sucks so bad? this film will make you rethink the origin of humanity. if this were the product of anthropology, you would rather defy darwinian theory and hegelian synthesis all together. you cannot bear to watch this even with your brain shut down. and now you are thinking, "i've got to see this." i warned you. i take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art. well, i did warn you. this should be forgotten and buried for ever.
