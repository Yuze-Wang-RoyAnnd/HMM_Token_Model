i should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $6 would be bad. i even read the reviews before watching this film, and that still didn't sway me. i loved the book, and i knew it couldn't be as bad as people said.<br /><br />yeah, it is.<br /><br />a patchwork of film, video, and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of james a. michener's epic novel. well, the time period covered was one chapter, but i don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book. the packaging on my copy of the movie gives maria conchita alonso top billing - though it turns out that she is only in one speaking scene. on the second tape.<br /><br />the actors are to be commended for playing their roles well, despite a smarmy, overwrought script. they are to be insulted, though, for accepting the roles in the first place.
