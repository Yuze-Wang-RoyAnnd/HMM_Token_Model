wow, this is anti-christian bias big-time! this is based on a stephen king novel and he written this kind of bias before and then hollywood exaggerates it even more. in this film, we see a protestant minister and a catholic priest both act like fools and be profane at the same time. of course, the devil has taken over the town so maybe his influence is into these guys, too, but they are typical hollywood portrayals. they never show a minister who talks and acts like billy graham, or your local minister or priest. and - another "given" - they make the satan character the most interesting of the film. <br /><br />max von sydow plays the devil and makes him a likable guy. ironically, von sydow has played a number of these roles after portraying jesus in the 1964 film, "the greatest story ever told." you wonder why actors are so screwed up? they don't know if they are god, satan or anyone in between.<br /><br />ed harris, who played a lot of unlikeable roles up until the last few years, is appropriately cast in this story. he and the rest of the mean-spirited characters in this film do not make it fun to watch.<br /><br />from what i've heard, king's book is even darker and more sick than this hate-filled movie but better constructed. frankly, who cares. king and hollywood deserve each other.
