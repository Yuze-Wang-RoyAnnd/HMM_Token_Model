i saw wicked little things as part of the "8 films to die for" horrorfest, and this was the only film that disappointed me. to wit, a mom, her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the pennsylvania mountains. every night, however, the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find.<br /><br />i guess the director was banking on his viewers being repulsed that children would be capable of pickaxe murders and eating human flesh (of which there are lavish close-ups, as a nice homage to george romero) because the film just isn't scary otherwise. simply put, there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids jogging to their next murder site. if someone's gonna get it in the barn, there will be a shot of the kids arriving at the barn (oh the suspense) and then moving in for the kill.<br /><br />come to think of it, why do the kids suddenly walk so slowly when they corner their prey? and not that i have any experience in this, but i think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot farther than this film implies...? nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents i've ever seen in any film. "the lock on the front door is busted"? you have an eight-year-old daughter in the woods with bears and mountain lions! fix it, you moron!!! plus, mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age- even for a teen pregnancy, and there's a pretty unbelievable death which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt.<br /><br />i'm giving this a 3 because it tried. as a splatter film it's not bad. but for good scares, go elsewhere.
