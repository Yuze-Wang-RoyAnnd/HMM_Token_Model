i thought "puppets making crank phone calls" was pretty low, but i don't believe that carlos mencia's show even qualifies as comedy. his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" as many times as he possible can. i have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on imdb before, but i really do hope this show is never renewed or rerun.<br /><br />mencia is trying to be the next dave chapelle, and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. it is obvious right down to the rip of chapelle's intro (blues guys vs. mariachi band). however, mencia has absolutely *no* attitude, and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time. instead he sticks to a small number of hardly-shocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes "jokes" about immigration. every once in a while, he'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like middle eastern cultures. these jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture, and perhaps some incredibly old topics (such as 9/11), in a watered down, stand-up style, while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience's style. i think he's too afraid of really offending anyone, so it just makes the viewer feel awkward. he also beats jokes to death. if you've ever seen "why the f*** is this news?" you'll know what i'm talking about. it's funny at first, but he just rambles on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point. <br /><br />it's a trainwreck that is purely painful to watch.
