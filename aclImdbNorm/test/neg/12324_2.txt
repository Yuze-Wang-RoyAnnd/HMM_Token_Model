this movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) i grew up with dr. seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. "the cat in the hat" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and mike myer's performance as the cat is mostly bewildering. why the borscht belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? i had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are simple. this movie is overblown and way, way too long.<br /><br />you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant, but this one set a new low. how could mike myers need the money?
