this is a perfect example of why many people say the 90's sucked when it comes to horror-movies. a boring voodoo-on-campus tale of terror starring the once so promising corey feldman (stand by me, the lost boys, etc). there might be just enough stuff happening to keep you from falling asleep and it doesn't look too cheap, but this still is horror aimed at an audience that were in their very early teens during the 90's. i might have been part of that audience, but still i got as good as nothing out of it when watching it now. and nowadays, teens are used to a lot more and better already, and i can't imagine any of them knowing or caring about who corey feldman was. or, "is", actually, as the dude's still making films. but the only thing still linking him to his days of glory, is the lost boys 2: the tribe sequel that got made recently. and i imagine even that one isn't going to encourage anyone to seek out voodoo. just another movie that got lost in 90's horror for obvious reasons.
