what the heck is this about? kelly (jennifer) seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island. she finds this juan p (manuel) existing and exotic, though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face, which he also justify later on in the movie, right or wrong? these two guys are the first to find each other on the island. kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great juan p can fish and built a somewhat house. mr handyman. they seem to have a great time. then billy zane (jack, kellys characters husband) shows up and of course, two days without knowing what his wife has been doing whit this gorgeous juan p, he is a little bit jealous. billy z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world. he dislikes juan p (for hitting his girlfriend at the pier, who can blame him? hes also is arrogant, but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and juan p who is the waiter/everything cant even fetch him a beer whit in 20 min. wouldn't you be upset? yet billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him. but at the same time, he is, not to be blamed for, suspicious about the scuba goggles manuel has. kelly and billy just lost some dear friends! how convenient he just happens to have them, no matter what!). however, for some strange reason kelly likes this girl hitting manuel and starts to hate billy for being jealous. ok, billy is overreacting, thats for sure, but kelly isn't doing much to convince him either. she spends more time with juan p and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice (and even though manuel yelled at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions. but kelly is so forgiving...). yeah right. and then she starts to have sex with this juan p. it should be said that kelly and billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident, at least, they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other. now, you can think that this scenario is possible. but for real, is it? are you cheating your husband after two days on a coconut island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar? (i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case). for christ sake, juan p hasn't really shown himself being a good person. catching some fish and built a wood house to get into someones panties, is that showing a good side? not trying to befriend kellys husband in anyway (which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island-time, simply be respect) he doesn't care about their relationship (and kelly cant figure that one out), he just want to have sex with kelly. kellys character is just not trustworthy (if she was stranded with billy and another attractive girl, wouldn't she be upset or what?!). or maybe she is? billy zane plays a not very nice person, and juan p isn't actually much better if you really think about it. and poor kelly is so confused, and believes having sex with juan p will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor juan p? so... for all of you who reads this... what do you think about it? if you where the kelly character, would you consider cheating on your husband, knowing one day you'll be back in real life, and all of a sudden billys maybe not that horrible person after all. hes just too jealous. and if you where billys character, what do you say, is he totally wrong in his behavior? and juan p character what do you guys really think of him. one thing is for sure. manuels exist! ps... the voodoo thing is so totally wrong here! what the heck was that about?! seriously! anyone tell me?
