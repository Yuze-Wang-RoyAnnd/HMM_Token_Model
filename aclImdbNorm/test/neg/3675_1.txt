it seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth watching. the acting was flat and the story lacked depth. there was too much reliance on camera work, which had some high points. i have to agree with the other negative comments. i only wish i had read them before buying the dvd. the film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand. there could have been a lot more plot development with why there are homeless in moscow (i.e. post-soviet 'capitalism', rampant drug usage (i.e. increased heroin trafficking from afghanistan); more development of why the resurgence of russian orthodoxy after the fall of the u.s.s.r.; the archaeologists themselves; or even more into the struggle against nihilism.
