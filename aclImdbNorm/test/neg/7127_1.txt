this film was utter tripe. possible that it is in fact a pollution. the subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake are no where to be seen. sarah michelle gellar is given nothing to do, even in her death sequence, but still she is the best performance in this film, and the her death is the best thing about it, even though she did deserve a better death. its the sign of very bad writing and directing. i'm guessing she did this film to end her connection with it as its turning rubbish.<br /><br />not scary. not tense. not funny. makes no sense at all. and as said above sarah michelle gellar gives the only reasonable performance out of the entire cast.
