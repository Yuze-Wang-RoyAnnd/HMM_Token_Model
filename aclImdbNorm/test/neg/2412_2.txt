the only thing good about this movie is the artwork on the promotion poster by h. r. geiger. anti-nuke protesters who all looked like punk rockers of the late 1970s, and somehow became non-violent, (except for their leader, "splatter") occupy the cities. fraternity boys descend on the punkers to do some violence on them and turn them into victims. bad acting and bad plot then descends on the real victim, you, the viewer. i gave this a "2" because a few sexual scenes at least give it mst3k potential.<br /><br />
