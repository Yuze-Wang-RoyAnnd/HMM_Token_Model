upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of philip baker hall i rented the first season disc of the loop.it's a typical tv comedy with all the clich'es that the genre employs with the "wacky" scheming brother (sully), "ditzy" blonde (lizzy), token unrequited love interest (piper), sarcastic asian helper (darcy, which reminded me of arliss, as if anyone needed to be reminded of that show). the plot deals with various bad luck (usually by sully) that befalls sam that puts his job at the airplane in jeopardy, only to have him save the day, with 'hilarious hijinks' ensuing in the middle. i didn't descibe a certain episode. i described them all to a t. therein lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets uselessly stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless repetition. sully will do something 'wacky', mimi rogers will say something overtly sexual, russ will tell about his gay son, darcy will do her impersonation of sandra oh on arliss blah blah blah blah blah. the only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track. but don't let that fool you into thinking it's any good. go watch a far better comedy. arrested development, always sunny in phillidelphia, two name two off the top of my head. surprised that this one is still on the air. oh that's right fox only cancels the good shows, i forgot. needless to say i don't trust my friend's taste in shows anymore.<br /><br />my grade: d+
