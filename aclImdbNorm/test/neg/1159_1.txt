ed gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, he was the inspiration for famous movie killers like norman bates, leatherface, and buffalo bill. he is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time, i watched a documentary on him, so i know his story pretty well. when i saw this, i was curious because i thought it was supposed to be like a documentary re-enactment, but i have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. first off, the facts are completely wrong, with a few minor exceptions, and secondly, this was just a stupid hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck. not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie, this was poorly acted! <br /><br />ed gein, he lives in a small town in wisconsin called plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole town is being effected by, he digs up dead bodies, as well as brutally murdering people. bobby, a deputy, is on the case to get ed gein, only, no one knows who the killer is at first, just finding crime scene after crime scene. but things get "personal" when ed starts messing with the policemen's family and friends.<br /><br />of course this movie was just ridicules and completely insulting to the true story. i always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick, but for this story, it should have been a better acted film, not to mention, it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clich'e'd horror film. please, stay away from this film, it's completely pathetic and untrue to the story of ed gein.<br /><br />1/10
