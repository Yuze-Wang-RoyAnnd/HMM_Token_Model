i have yet to watch starcrash (1979) - that notoriously cheesy italian take on star wars (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which, suffice it to say, makes mel brooks' so-so spaceballs (1987) look like a veritable work of art! in fact, the main reason why galaxina is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - playboy centerfold dorothy stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! <br /><br />although statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by jamie lee curtis and mariel hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet or other; in fact, galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the blue star (cue choral music) once they land! having said that, statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either.<br /><br />still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying captain cornelius butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here), a long-eared, wing-sporting colored guy, a pot-smoking, proverb-quoting old chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. the villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the blue star, exclaims, "what is this s**t?" there is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive hollywood veteran, angelo rossitto!<br /><br />for what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include skin and tonic, scotsman on the rocks, thigh pies, baked alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the harley davidson) and when our heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their "lord". god(awful) indeed...
