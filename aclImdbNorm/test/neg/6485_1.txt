i bought this 'film' from a gas station in the 3.99 bin for one reason: billy drago, who is one of my favorite actors. he is terrifically creepy and good, but that's where it stops. the movie itself is a dirt cheap, gratingly awful attempt at a horror western, and manages neither, never mind a successful merging of the two genres. the acting besides drago's is so bad i wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears, the production values are nonexistent and the script , i don't even know where to start.<br /><br />avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard drago fan like me.<br /><br />terrible, shameful unforgivable.
