so many bad reviewers, it made me wonder, what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director??? did you all expected a super-hit flawless movie?? no way, you already can see, raj kumar kohli loves multi-starrer movies... all of his earlier works where multi-starrers, but no one was flawless. take the first jaani dushman for instance, so many flaws, but still good fun. anyways sticking to the movie, the movie jaani dushman is a hindi fantasy film about a snake, who can take any form (armaan (munish) kohli) which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover (manisha koirala) on the people who caused it. its quite good, with a great star-cast. but i think it could have been much much better. for instance, take the script, can't say its flawless. for example take the ages:<br /><br />do 40-48 yrs old still study in university??<br /><br />there are many many more, i won't list more, but there are dozen more. a solid 5.5 is good for this one.<br /><br />**.75
