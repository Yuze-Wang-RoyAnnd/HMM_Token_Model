not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies. i'm talking about how big productions companies waste so much money in things that actually are boring and not to talk about ridiculous. with the millions they used to make a movie like this, because i don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant sum. with that money imagine how many good independent movies you could make, or maybe one good hollywood movie. its just to rip you off, but not anyone, just the majority of teens that are willing to go and see an ashton kutcher movie, just because they are fans of him. i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. if you actually look at it in prospective the actors are the same quality of this movie. so i guess i shouldn't be surprise, i actually couldn't have expected more.
