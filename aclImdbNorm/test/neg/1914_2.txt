i watched this on cable because i was a big leelee fan. big mistake. what a horrible film. you don't care one bit for any of the characters in the movie. chris klein plays a guy who is a complete jerk in the film, and steals away josh hartnett's longtime girlfriend. if the writer knew what they were doing, this film would have followed the proven formula, and made hartnett an ass, and leelee as the girlfriend trapped in a bad relationship, from which she's saved by klein. but hartnett is a really cool guy, who shows a lot of emotion and love for leelee. <br /><br />you then hate leelee, because she cheats on hartnett with klein, who is a jerk to everyone in the town that's trying to help him and really stuck up. <br /><br />it's also really campy, and the characters do everything but run around the kitchen dancing and lip synching, and using hairbrushes and spoons and fake microphones (although they come very close). <br /><br />what a horrible horrible movie. you don't even care what happens in the end because the director never lets you care about the characters.
