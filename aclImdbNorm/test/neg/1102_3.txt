i can't believe that i let myself into this movie to accomplish a favor my friends ask me early this april 14, 2007. this movie certainly a pain in your ass in theater and sickly boring, i haven't even felt the gory impact of its "daunting scenes" which i deem to be complete failure to attract its audience. the worst even trampled me, cause my friend failed to come on time at the theater because she was busy assisting her boyfriend in looking for an appropriate lodge to stay in for one night. i wasn't really disappointed with that matter, but this movie is a matter indeed for me, poor plot, useless storyline, naively created and i don't know what to say anymore.<br /><br />the title doesn't suggest anyway the creeps and horror it failed to overture us viewers, maybe the beating of the animals could get more the creeps if they show it in theaters the real situational play. good luck to anyone who attempts to watch it anyway.
