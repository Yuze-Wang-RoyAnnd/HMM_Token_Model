it is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie.<br /><br />imagine king kong being recast as an organ grinder's monkey and fay wray's part being played by a young boy. how about elton john as rambo!!!!.this movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter.<br /><br />by using the title watchers and dean koontz's name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book.<br /><br />read the book, i have never talked to anyone who didn't like it. another good book is the winner by david baldachi.
