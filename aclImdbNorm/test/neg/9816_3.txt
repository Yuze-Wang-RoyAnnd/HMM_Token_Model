a pig-tailed linnea quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after they have sex. she goes to an asylum, makes a best friend out of amy (karen russell) and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by "carol burnett show" regular lyle waggoner). on the outside, these two man-hating mafia princesses (!) stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they're systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved, leather-clad mystery killer.<br /><br />the hideous david barton fx are so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take on a sort-of surrealistic quality. same goes for the movie. the dialogue is so strange and stilted, the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other-worldly, you'll start to doubt your own sanity. this film actually attempts to have a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it's all so poorly handled it's almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an ingmar bergman script! and like any good bergman film, this has a mature moral to abide by--any good party needs a proper guy/girl "ratio," so there will be enough chicks to "tickle your lizard." see it for yourself... or don't!<br /><br />linnea (the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with) is very amusing in this one, has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye-popping nude scenes. unfortunately, she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it.<br /><br />score: 3 out of 10
