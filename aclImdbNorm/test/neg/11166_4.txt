korea's answer to "i know what you did last summer" follows a similar story route to its american counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one. who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea?<br /><br />originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and scary. record is neither, churning out badly rehashed scenes from "i know...", "the house on sorority row" and "the faculty" (among many others) and failing to deliver one decent shock throughout the 95 minutes.<br /><br />acting is decent from the cast who, as seems to be the norm in korean cinema, approach an uninspiring script with gusto and an undeserved enthusiasm. direction is mediocre at best, however; a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer's costume *ever* contributing to record's downfall. most disappointing is the film's ending, where the two 'surprise twists' are that obvious you've earlier dismissed them as being too blatant!<br /><br />record's only saving grace is its bright start - the first act is actually excellent and shows the american counterparts how character development and setting the mood are supposed to be done - but, other than that, this is a very poor movie. not recommended. <br /><br />** / *****
