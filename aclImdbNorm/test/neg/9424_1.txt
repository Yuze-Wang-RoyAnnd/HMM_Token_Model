this film is a load of crap. it's quite disturbing to see that anyone is able to say that this is one of the best films of the year. what can i say? bad acting, bad action scenes which becomes really comical in the end. pardon me if this was a comedy, then i didn't understand it. if it was i regret laughing of the tent scenes! do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of watching this! good night!
