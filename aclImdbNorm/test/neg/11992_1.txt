mr. "uwe fail" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. poor acting; poor directing; awful adaptation; i mean, far-cry game was awesome, its like a true fps game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of "point and shoot". in the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. well we had some of the "point and shoot" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another "uwe fail" movie you will understand. if you don't believe me, go to the website "petition online" and do a check for one named "stop uwe bowl".<br /><br />that movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop him for once.<br /><br />don't waste your time.
