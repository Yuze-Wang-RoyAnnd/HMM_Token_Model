as americans, we have come to expect crapiness as "par for the course" when it comes to horror and unknown directors directing unknown actors acting for unknown writers. we truly expect this to suck & when they don't suck,it becomes an over night success.<br /><br />this is not an over night success, nor is it an over the weekend or over the month success. this blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this: go into this knowing it sucks, enjoy it for what it is, for what it isn't & if you have something better to do, keep this on the back way back burner. it's entertaining in the way watching the elderly cross a busy street during rush hour, but don't expect much-they almost never get hit by an actual car, its just a lot of hoopla.
