steven segal's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema. i have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as i realized that they were even more unrealistic than jean claude vandamme's. has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit?! i mean, give me something to root for...a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary. twenty years and he's still filming the same fight scenes. fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. the boring choreography of a segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief. worse yet, he's woefully out of shape. just what we need, a fat stiff who thinks he's a leading man. there's not one iota of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes. do not watch this unless you feel like throwing away an hour and a half of your life.
