i think vampire movies (usually) are wicked. even if the film itself isn't all that good, i still like it 'cos its got vampires in it. but this stinks. it really does give vampire movies a bad name.<br /><br />for a start, the cheapness really shows. i'm not usually that bothered about low budget films - one of my favourite all-time movies is el mariachi which only cost $7000 - but i hate this. the actions a load of crap as well, resorting to a 'stylish' wobbling camera which gives you headache.<br /><br />theres not much more to say other than don't watch this. i bought it for lb1.50 as it was an ex-rental and i feel cheated out of my money, even for that low price.
