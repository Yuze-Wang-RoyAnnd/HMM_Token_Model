this movie is a bizarre fantasy tale, that i'm sure doesn't appeal to anyone over 10, but is too strange for children. the plot is stupid, and the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen.<br /><br />25-year old kathy ireland plays a teenage girl who acts like a 9-year old. she seems to have gotten her character's voice by listening to alvin and the chipmunks. her high pitched, screechy baby voice gets annoying the second she starts talking. all of the other acting is bad, but really kathy ireland is by far the worst. the plot is also terrible and is kind of a mix between alice in wonderland and mad max. wanda saknussemm (ireland) gets a letter saying her father, who left her a long time ago, fell down a bottomless pit in africa, and when she goes to find him, she falls into an underground world full of strange australian accented people. it's one of the corniest movie you'll ever see, with terrible lines throughout. <br /><br />it's annoying the effects this movie uses for character development. kathy ireland is a nerd who won't do anything or go anywhere. she flies to africa....wow, what development! she drops her glasses and then doesn't need them. why does dropping one's glasses represent them not becoming a nerd. it should represent her descent into blindness. it's just stupid. the only positive i can think is there are semi-good special effects and camera work, and the musical score sounds ok.<br /><br />overall this a ridiculous family fantasy that will only appeal to those who expect nothing from a movie.<br /><br />my rating: 1/2 out of ****. 84 mins. pg for violence.
