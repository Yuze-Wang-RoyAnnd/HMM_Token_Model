this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life. rod steiger who stars as the ornery grandfather, charlie, is in full overacting mode hoping that the more flashy he is, the better his performance (cue buzzer sound). rod steiger is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this film (although end of days is the 2nd worst film i've ever seen) is really heartbreaking. from the bad storyline to the nonexistent direction, it becomes abudantly clear that the only reason this film was made was that the producer's last name ended in delaurentis. the only good thing about this film is that it is so bad, it's truly hysterical. look for the flashback scene where rod where's a jor-el wig from superman and a big black porno mustache. one only hopes that his follow up film, i believe in america, from uber-producer kevin arbouet will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyone's mouths.
