a better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of bosnia. some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children, but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary. woody harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary. should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of bosnia. if one expects a great and gripping movie, welcome...... will be a disappointment.
