this was a pathetic movie. the alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful. the plot is something that's been done over and over again! however, this one does it the worst! the acting was c**p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. no one developed any concern for the main character. the movie was far too slow paced, and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie. there are some movies which "suck" but can still be enjoyed because of there total outrageousness, but this doesn't even have that!! whoever made this film thought that they could make something good and they failed miserably. there is nothing this movie has to offer except a headache. avoid it!
