strangeland (1998) d: john pieplow. kevin gage, elizabeth pena, brett harrelson, robert englund, tucker smallwood, amy smart, dee snider (twisted sister), amal rhoe. disturbing scenes of torture `highlight' this dark, disgusting movie about a sadistic psychopath who lures teens into his torture chamber via the internet. snider (from ex-80s rock band twisted sister) plays the putrid psychopath, who is a grimy `twist' (no pun intended) on hannibal lecter. pena is wasted as one of the victims' mothers. harrelson (brother of woody) delivers one of the worst cop performances i have ever seen in a movie, and rhoe proves why this is her only screen credit with an equally pathetic performance. the heavy metal soundtrack is ultimately numbing, the torture scenes very graphic and gross, and the ending just sucks. rating: 3 out of 10. rated r for graphic violence and torture, strong language, and sexual situations.
