i remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. at first it sounded like a great idea. a retelling of an american classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day. there was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original "lone ranger", clayton moore. the movie studio had threatened legal action if moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (moore was performing at children's hospitals as the lone ranger for sick kids.) to many americans clayton moore was just that the; the one and only lone ranger. i had always felt that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and legacy of the lone ranger if moore had been treated better. maybe even a cameo in the new movie. how ever this was not the case, and many of the viewing public stayed away in droves. also the story and acting were weak. all this added up to a big box office bomb, and rightly so. i personally i'm glad the studio lost big money after the way the real lone ranger was treated. you don't treat an american icon that way.
