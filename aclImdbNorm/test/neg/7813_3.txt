"there are some things you just don't do" so says the tag-line of this, a 2003 david zucker comedy about a young man caught up in one horrendous situation after another entitled my boss's daughter, and it's the tag-line which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it. there are indeed some things you just don't do, with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within my boss's daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture. my boss's daugther is a sordid; creepy; grotesque experience, a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. to see it is to endure it, to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself
