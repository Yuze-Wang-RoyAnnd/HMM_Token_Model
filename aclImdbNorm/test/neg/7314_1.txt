'gross misconduct' was one of a series of texts released in australia during the early-to-mid 1990s that explored the supposed victimisation of the privileged heterosexual male in the age of feminism. this creature only needs look at a pretty young thing, and he's accused of sexual harassment, and his life is ruined. damn those women's libbers! grrr...<br /><br />as my tone might suggest, i don't buy any of this anti-feminist bs, and correspondingly didn't enjoy this film. 'gm' trivialises the issues of sexual harassment and teacher-student relations. sexual harassment is here the product of a confused young woman's imagination, and those professional boundaries that teachers are meant to maintain ... well, when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man (and played by jimmy smits!), well needn't worry about those.<br /><br />sexist trash, and even by reviewing it, i'm giving it more time than it deserves.
