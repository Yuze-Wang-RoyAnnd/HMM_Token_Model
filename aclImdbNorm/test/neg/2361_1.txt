i cannot believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross-section of the 'bright young things' of its era, but i'm certain i wish it hadn't. in my opinion it is an inaccurate, poorly acted, weakly scripted, pretentiously directed piece of gumpf. the brief outings to an imagined reality bludgeon any humour to death. the situations are unsubtle exaggerations which make the the already flimsy characters even more unbelievable and detestable. the romance is dull, the end is unsatisfying and ruins the only sensible drugs message in the film and the simple plot ('withnail and i,' 'fear and loathing') is tested to extremes with the uninteresting motion of the film. in short this film as a blatant visual assault with no hint of skill or initiative. i condemn it to the ash heap of history and pray it stays there.
