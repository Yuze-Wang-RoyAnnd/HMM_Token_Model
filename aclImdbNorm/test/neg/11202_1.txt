gordon scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin english has to be the worst of all the tarzans. as for the other actors in this mess, they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. i've seen used car dealers in tv commercials who can act better. they make clayton moore look like laurence olivier! and where does jane (the dull eve brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? i realize these were made for kids but wow! the plot line seemed ok but the director should have required more from his actors. i realize even the weissmuller films have a few flaws but this one seemed so "low budget".
