every time i think about this film i feel physically ill. to read such a great book and later discover there's a film of it was a great feeling. years later and imagine my joy at switching on the sci-fi channel and finding it starts in just 5mins!!! up go the titles and then uggg. if just a couple of things had changed ok. everything is changed. numerous characters are removed entirely new rubbish ones are added. the main hero is shrunk and de-aged by about 30 years, and hilariously his girlfriend/wife is now his mother! even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie capabilities. this is truly appalling cinema at its absolute worst. i would quite happily remove my own toenails with pliers rather than sit through another horrific viewing, and i urge anyone thinking of watching this - please don't. if you own a copy burn it now, right now and think how much better your life would have been had this celluloid insult never occurred.
