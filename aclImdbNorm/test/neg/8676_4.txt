well, this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. and, as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there, the character of fanny price is no where to be found. instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character. at least in the 1999 movie the character they call "fanny price" is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good. this "fanny price" is a complete enigma. someday, i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen. a sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution. she is reserved in manner and painfully honest, but also strong in her convictions, unfailingly loyal, extremely intelligent, and remarkably astute. a bit of a late bloomer, it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self-possessed young woman. and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most. it's a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed.
