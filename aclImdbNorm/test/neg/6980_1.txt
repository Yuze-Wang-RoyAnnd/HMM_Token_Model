i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. after seeing the trailer i thought - what an unfunny movie full of clich'es. but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well. what a waste of time... the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, i couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies, but that also is pretty pass'e. i couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because i found them utterly stupid. the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally.
