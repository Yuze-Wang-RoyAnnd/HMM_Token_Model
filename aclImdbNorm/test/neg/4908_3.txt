[warning contains spoilers]<br /><br />i felt no sympathy for any of the characters, incl the main one, who gets over the death of his girl friend v.quickly, (but it's ok as he shacks up with an ex prostitute from the casino he works at). the main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who gets drawn into a web of deception, all the while there is running his monologue of the book he is writing. i can't say i would buy the book, a much better premise perhaps would have been if the voice-over (which annoyingly cuts in to narrate any bit of the film that you might not have understood, via his book) would've had 52 different personailties... to represent each card in the deck, but i digress. in the end there was a twist, whereby the main character has been setup by someone close to him, but as i disliked his character so much by this point (i found it impossible to like anyone in this film, the characters are all one dimensional zombies) that i really didn't care, and was glad the film was over.<br /><br />plus points: the english actress from er doing a dodgy south african accent minus points: an irritating film
