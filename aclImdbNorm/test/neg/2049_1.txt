worst. movie. ever made. ever. i have no words to say about it.. other then it truly had no point, no plot, no... anything. sheer crap!!! i don't know how everyone in the movie didn't shoot them shelves after watching it.... .... .... ... .. i love vampire flicks and mysteries, and alternate abstract outside the box films, and.... this was non of those. i mean what the crap!!! i cant even tell you what the film was about cuz i still don't know, and i just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it... bottom line.. i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs. thats the only thing i got from this film. please don't watch this... i mean for a " sultry sensual vampire flick" there wasn't even the to be expected nudity you'd get from a vamp flick. anyway back to my point.... this movie blows. go set yourself on fire instead.... .. ..
