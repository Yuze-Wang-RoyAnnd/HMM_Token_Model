yeah, i know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place, it's hilarious.<br /><br />if you want some accuracy, this is not a movie to rely on. it starts with the flight from s~ao paulo to rio aboard a 747. this will never happen on the 400 km flight. smaller planes such as 737 or a-320 shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour. the drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth. perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the very known taxicab drivers itineraries when faced to tourists. not that it would be a local habit as i myself got ripped off in very serious places such as switzerland. the girls, yes. all topless. that's something an outsider will never understand. brazilian chicks will be happy to expose 100 % of their incredible bodies at the samba schools parades and wear almost non-existent bikinis at beach, but never go topless. a handful beaches across the whole country will allow it. all carefully secluded and out of town. oh, the indoor decoration; the amazing wallpaper... maybe in disneyworld... apart from that, it is very entertaining and, yes, demi moore is absolutely splendid.
