wait... wait... wait... wait... wait... wait..... what!? this movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. the only reason kiefer sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to kiefer fans, only to have their hearts broken. he kills one guy, gets shot, and dies before half the movie is over, not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died...why put him on the cover if his character blows. 2. where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. it was way too confusing, i mean whats up with the girl? she had to narrate the movie to try to get our attention, she failed! 4. if kiefer dies in a movie..... it fails. now i am going to go watch 24..... this movie fails!
