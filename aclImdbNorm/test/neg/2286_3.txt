connery climbs aboard the moore buffoon train in this stinker of a movie. tossing away everything that made bond successful in the first place, this movie further degrades the bond character throwing him into the category of inspector gadget. get smart this ain't. there is no style here, only second rate actors performing on cheap sets. it's a shame that connery couldn't lend an element of class here but it doesn't come across. everything here reeks of mediocrity, including connery's bad toupee. perhaps if i was snowed in and given the choice between watching "never say never again" and "howard the duck" i would choose the former. if you want the real james bond, pick up any ian flemming novel.
