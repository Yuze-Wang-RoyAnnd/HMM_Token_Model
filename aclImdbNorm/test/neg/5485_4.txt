this is my first almodavar film. i'll confess we chose it mainly because we knew this had the enticing prospect of antonio banderas in gay sex scenes.<br /><br />unfortunately, that is about all that this film has to recommend it. i consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer, i like european films, "art" films, and i am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not to my particular taste.<br /><br />but this film was a complete blank to me. the plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it a "hilarious comedy" but i didn't laugh once. loosly and awkwardly constructed, with a lot of pointless dialogue. i don't get this at all-- it seems like an amateurish effort. can someone enlighten me?
