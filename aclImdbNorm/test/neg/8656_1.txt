neal n nikki is voted on of the worst films of the year by planetbollywood. its hard to believe the famous chopra's have produced this lousy movie. it was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. the title song is the most annoying song of the decade, i'm the neil, i'm the man, rock star superstar. uday chopra is one of bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent. after making many super flops, and not receiving any movies from a producer rather then his family. he gives a total crap performance, that bores you to death. tanisha, who is and will always be known for being kajol's sister, gives a dreadful performance. both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and are very immature for their age. it has a special appearance by the very cute richa pollad, in a pathetic role. the ending was so daft and stupid, i cant believe i actually paid money to rent this crap.
