this version of mansfield park, while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the compassion i felt for fanny which is crucial and central to this jane austen story. this was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress, sylvestra le touzel. she had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth. the scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in hysterics was hysterical. she badly overplayed that crucial scene and i actually felt sorry that henry crawford ever cared for her.<br /><br />the polar opposite is the portrayal of mary crawford by jackie smith- wood. what a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self-centered, selfish yet vulnerable to love.<br /><br />i have always loved fanny. she is mild mannered but with an implacable sense of what is right, and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration. the fanny in this adaptation is too meek and subservient with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series. as much as i wanted to like this fanny....i just could not. <br /><br />i suggest skipping this version of mansfield park for the real thing...the novel. fanny will not disappoint...you will love her!
