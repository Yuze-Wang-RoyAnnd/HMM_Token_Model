well, to each his own, but i thought gibson's hamlet was the most god-awful rendition i had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. the only reason i watched the movie through to the end was that i held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. no luck.<br /><br />no disrespect for the supporting cast or for zefferelli's staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. i have seen hamlet well-portrayed as an african prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. etc. etc. . but imho this portrayal was just a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams.
