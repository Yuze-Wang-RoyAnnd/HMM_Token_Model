oh how awfully this movie is! i don't know if it is a horror film or a drama, cause the story and the both genres are not established very well! the story is not moving, it is slow, boring, and sleepy from the beginning to end. this movie really bores me! but i really liked the camera work, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat. but this movie makes me grab a pillow, lay on the bed and sleep until the credits roll...<br /><br />boring! not worth watching! i tell you, this movie sucked!<br /><br />1/10
