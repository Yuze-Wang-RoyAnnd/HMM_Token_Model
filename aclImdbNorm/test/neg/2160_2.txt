back in the cold and creepy early 90's,a show called "family matters" aired and became an instant classic.the trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts to sarcastic remarks in it and you had yourself a lovely little stealing-is-wrong,parents-are-right-show. so that worked out fine, so bickley-warren had a new ambitious plan: making the exact same show again.<br /><br />here's the difference though: "family matters" had urkel. "step by step" has the guy from those "kickboxer"-sequels nobody saw. he says things like "dudette" and "the dane-meister", and somehow the audience is still not supposed to hate him. i mean seriously, "dudette"? how can you even get that across your lips?<br /><br />the rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole winslow-bunch, combined with some more one-or-zero-dimensional characters, like the dumb guy (jt. well, eddie), the smart girl (laura), and a pretty girl who spends her days looking pretty(in theory).the character development was just awful in this show. grover and the cookie monster have more depth than the lambert family. everybody just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. they weren't worth much.<br /><br />powered by a massive laugh-and-cheer tape stolen from something funny,this show aired for a whopping 7 years,which was humiliating for the competition.although,you'll have to note that this is the time where family sitcoms were pretty much all big hits,everybody just ignored their crappyness because well,it was the 90s,one more crappy show didn't hurt.
