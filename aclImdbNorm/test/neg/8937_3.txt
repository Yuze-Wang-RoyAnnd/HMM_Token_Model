a less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence. some northern idiots come to the deep south looking for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary whiskey mountain. they are menaced by scary hillbillies, in a wide nod to 'deliverance'; but it turns out that the hicks are fronting for a northern marijuana-trafficking badass. this is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist. the women are locked up and raped into catatonia; rather than rescuing them, the guys run down to town to get the sheriff, who is lazy and doesn't believe them. i think if my girlfriend were being raped i'd kind of take the shortest route to the hideout anyway. it's ok though because as soon as they show up to tenderize the baddies the girls get all cheery and hop around, if only trauma were like this in real life. also featuring a backwoods guy with a beard who cackles a lot. not exactly bursting at the seams with ideas.
