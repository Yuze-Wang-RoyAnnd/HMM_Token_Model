child's play made a new genre of horror,the killer dolls,some of this films has not got too much money for make it but i think that the only film that make shadow to chucky is this.ok it's a tipical product direct to video or direct to tv but pinocchio is not real and the killer is the little girl.the imagination of children are too big and this film play with it.the roles are good and candance mckenzie is great.<br /><br />
