that this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that god is truly dead. am i the only one that really saw (rather sleptwalked) through this "film"? this is the only movie i've ever seen in the theater that i regret not walking out on and demanding my money back -- it was just that dull. and i even saw "highlander 2: the quickening" at the local cinema. from beginning to end, gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies, cast together by circumstance, who eventually work together as best buddies. the action (what little there is) is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer. thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our "cinema" that there's no chance for an "air america 2."
