ok i gave this a three a three! it deserves only one star no questions asked.<br /><br />if your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a legit b-horror movie than yes it will get one star. but i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crap.<br /><br />with this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more "hollywood" but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish. we laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedy.<br /><br />the acting is terrible..... the effects and death sequences are so bad.... the story complete crap.....<br /><br />but the fact they are trying to make a serious horror movie..priceless!<br /><br />the most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed "dark basement" which is clearly lit, and they pretend to not be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling bahahahaha just terrible.....<br /><br />so if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is, along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this movie....<br /><br />wait why am i writing so much? no one knows about this movie...i doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.
