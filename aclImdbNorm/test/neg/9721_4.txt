i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production. the covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen.<br /><br />the story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of ipswitch a survivors of the salem witch trials. they also happen to be a part of the secret sect called "the covenant". their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive. in theory this would make a pretty good action sci-fi movie
