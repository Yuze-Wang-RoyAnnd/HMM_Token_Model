i like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa, because in germany you can't get it anywhere. i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the subspecies or puppetmaster series, because they were full of atmosphere.<br /><br />i was glad when the movie finally arrived.<br /><br />but after watching this cheesy movie, i was very disappointed. the actors ( i think you can't even say actors) are boring and untalented. the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy.<br /><br />i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie. :-)
