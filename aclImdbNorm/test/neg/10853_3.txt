a very bad film, an amalgam of clich'es and historical inaccuracies. a few examples: in an early scene soviet infantry are attacked by the germans; instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they advance into open ground to fight them,contrary to all infantry tactics; kate, one of the central characters, is supposedly the daughter of a white russian and obsessed with her russianness, yet she does not speak russian; a guilt-stricken german airman attacks an anti-aircraft gun- the gun, however, does not fire shrapnel shells but scores a direct hit on his 'plane, which doesn't look much like a german 'plane of wwii. in fairness, when they could escape the preposterous plot and the consequent absurdities there are some genuinely powerful moments- the depiction of people slowly starving to death is convincingly done and moving, but these only show up the rest of it even more. a film to be avoided.
