quite liked flesh and looking forward to heat but couldn't help but feel morrissey grossly exploited most of the "performers" featured here. stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all dallesandro was capable of in this feature--a huge and heartbreaking contrast from flesh. his semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting; mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs. woodlawn is a revelation all right--she is the embodiment of the lower east side. but hers is a one woman show--she rarely engages the other performers though, it has to be said, her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves halle berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion. when she pounces on a young, would-be lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire. two of the female performers, andrea and jane, have such annoying voices you'll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. the fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation. but they were probably desperate to get in front of morrissey's camera anyway. there probably isn't a worse way to spend a saturday night but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life.
