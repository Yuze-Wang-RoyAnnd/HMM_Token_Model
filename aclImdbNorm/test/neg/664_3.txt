another movie with a star of a wrestling. so far i have noticed....wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. this movie is no exception.<br /><br />the action is dreadful. it makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid. the acting is horrible, possibly from the bad director.<br /><br />the plot was stupid....just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals, and they get randomly killed off. the movie is stupid all the way through, making it one of the worst i have ever seen.<br /><br />the only think and this is why i give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way jacob goodnight dies. the pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome.<br /><br />overall this is a really horrible movie, and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.
