this film plays like a demented episode of vh1's "where are they now", or "behind the music". in the first half of the movie (that depict his "glory days") abbie hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star. you know the kind; the poseur lead singer, the pretty boy, who didn't write any of the music, doesn't have a clue, but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free. consequently he takes his success for granted, abuses it, and ultimately destroys it along with himself. indeed hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when he was busted for dealing cocaine, skipped bail, and went into hiding. <br /><br />the second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding. in it we see hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone, anyone, but himself for his downfall. eventually the times pass him by completely; and he can never to come to grips with that. how sad. the end. end credits roll and oh no! we learn that abbie hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989.<br /><br />i'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for hoffman in making this movie. given that tom hayden and gerald lefcourt were involved, i'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all, an icon of the 60's and of the left's anti-war movement. in this they have failed miserably. the film presents abbie hoffman as a mindless caricature. we are never told about what drives him. how did he arrive at his views? how did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? how did he organize such a vast movement? why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine? why? who knows, and since the filmmakers don't seem to, ultimately who cares?
