i just don't know how this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film is a blockbuster. it was so boring with a very, very weak (or no) story-line and wasn't even a jot funny. the film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about prem (salman khan) is a love guru and is helping hapless & romantic bhaskar (govinda) to get the girl he wants. i'm not saying that i didn't like the film because it wasn't funny or anything, i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. the only two reasons why i can say it's a super-hit are: <br /><br />1. salman khan & govinda are on-screen together but there first time together was in salaam e ishq which was a flop so it can't be. but it was a really good movie.<br /><br />2. salman khan's name is prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including maine pyar kiya. so it's just luck.<br /><br />i heard that it's a remake of hitch, i've not seen it & i'm glad i didn't. music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner, you're my love & soni de nakhre but what is the use of it in a really bad film, that too, if you have someone like katrina kaif who dances with two left feet? she is completely crap. neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dance and always fails to impress. i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in koffee with karan. overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress katrina kaif. its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again.
