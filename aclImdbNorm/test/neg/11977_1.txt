this was a disgrace to the game farcry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare. besides the bad acting the visual effects, stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. the movie is not worth watching at all. the funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs. guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time. i hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday. and i they will invest some good cash to get the visual effects right and the scenaries right as well as the acting right. but till then don't waste time by trying to watch this movie because it will surely make you go mad specially if you are a farcry lover.
