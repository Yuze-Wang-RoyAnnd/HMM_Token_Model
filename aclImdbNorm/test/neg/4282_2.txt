the animation is great, i'll concede to that. but disney perpetuated every stereotype we alaskans have been trying to overcome for the last two generations. and the names, i mean, come on...sitka, kenai, tanana & denahi (cheesy takeoff of denali)?! those are real places where real people live! and the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the earth seeking vengeance over this trite little flick. disney, you're based out of california & florida, right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country. if you can't stick to what you know, at least hire and/or work with people who know what area you're trying to caricuture. maybe then it wouldn't be so insulting! :(
