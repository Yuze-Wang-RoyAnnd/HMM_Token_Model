the 1994 film production of heart of darkness was in no way capable of living up to the outstanding book. the film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than aiding them in understanding what was going on. the director was obviously not experienced, and if he is, then he didn't show it. on top of that, scenes from the book were left out or changed, scenes that were rather important. the movie left me feeling rather bored and was a complete waste of my time. the characters acted as though they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not portray the emotions that marlow and the rest revealed in the book. overall, the movie was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was otherwise necessary to make it even remotely interesting.
