a woman in love with her husband (he's suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. she's been to a fertility clinic - as has the lover she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world (the $5 turkey baster), they engage in coitus. we also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fianc'ee, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse. further, even though this is a business arrangement, the first time she's with her sperm donor, she takes off all her clothes, as if it's a seduction. plus, her husband doesn't notice when $30,000 goes missing from their bank accounts. does all this seem to demand more willing suspension of disbelief than even most hollywood fare? far fetched on all counts.
