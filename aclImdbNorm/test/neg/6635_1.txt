yes, the votes are in. this film may very well be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation. but whereas ed wood's film, for all its flaws, retains a certain charm despite it all, this film defines the word "charmless" to the nth degree. in fact, i'd suggest to the editors of the oxford english dictionary to cite this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the dictionary.<br /><br />carrot top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that i know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill mr. top as soon as possible. indeed, if one goes to amazon.com and look at customer reviews for carrot top's movie and other performance dvd, one will find several that could be construed as death threats to mr. top.<br /><br />one other curious fact about this film, i recall that mike nelson, the head writer for mst 3000, in his book mike's mega cheese about movies, good and bad, said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldn't recall a thing about it, including the title. obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma. viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing, mike nelson had to block it from his mind. (evidently, in a later chapter in his book, mike nelson had recovered his memeory of this film. from the review he offers, mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory.)<br /><br />the only comment i offer about the film, and it is not a spoiler, it's simply god's honest truth, it's not funny. none of it is, not even a nanosecond of it is funny.
