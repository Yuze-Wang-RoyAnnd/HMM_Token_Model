i...i don't know where to begin. dragon hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history. even anus magilicutty was better than this, as it was intentionally bad. showgirls? no, it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film. but dragon hunt takes the cake, and eats it, then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man. it's that much of a travesty.<br /><br />the acting, if it can even be called that, is rough. it doesn't have the charm of improvised acting, so it must be scripted, but it's recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality. several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically, those people on screen) either regretted being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from saturday night live, which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera. i could write another three paragraphs on the quality of acting in this film, but you and i both don't want to hear it.<br /><br />the make-up and special effects (which, with most films, is the only good thing) was laughably bad. the antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous i can't remember it, has a mohawk glued to the top of his head. yeah, glued to his head. and you can tell it's glued on too, if you look at the spot where it meets his pockmarked skull you can see a plastic strip, not unlike the ones on fake eyelashes. thankfully he's pretty much the only example of make-up no-nos in the film.<br /><br />there's also some terrible character development, to put it lightly. the women, who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly benevolent fugly brothers (and i mean, they are really pushed around), are not only ugly but...gasp...they don't know what they're doing! in one scene they turn on their apparent lovers, join up with the even uglier bad guy, and then snort some coke. apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine, because they started shaking and laughing even before all of it went up their nostrils. great timing girls! plus they wear some truly horrible stuff, clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s.<br /><br />overall this movie, this film, this waste of film i should say, is also a waste of time. watching it will hurt you, and will require the suspension of not only your belief, but also of your entire brain. if you want to get stoned with your friends and have some good laughs, see if you can get this film (you'll probably have to download it) otherwise, don't even think about it. hope i was helpful.
