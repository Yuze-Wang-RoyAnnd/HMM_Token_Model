based on a fairly bland "best seller," this film - like most other lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie. the only difference here was that meredith baxter wasn't in it. the women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.<br /><br />the characters in this were all clich'e and one-dimensional. the story was of the cheesy nature. i wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great. i only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn't have to read the book her sister loaned to her. it wasn't made for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end though, so she didn't think it was as terrible as i did.
