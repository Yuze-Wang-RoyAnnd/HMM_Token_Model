this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it. this was a mistake. i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck, terrible, horrible, but somehow you just can't look away. shaudenfraud i guess! ; ).<br /><br />this is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the caribbean. one by one they are all murdered. one drinks cleaning fluid, one gets blown up on a waverunner, one goes over a cliff...so these are not accidents, but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should "wrap" the shoot and go home, not just in respect for the dead, but perhaps out of fear for their own lives. no. they just continue with their shoot because that is what's most important. forget about the dead models, we have a magazine to produce!<br /><br />one of the subplots is the evil magazine owner, played by lee majors, rex is his name. he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says "well, i can't say this won't be good for sales", mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha". so absurd. another subplot is when it's revealed that rex is one of the models baby dady, only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort. she didn't, but always resented him for even suggesting this.<br /><br />they try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named raule, seemingly because he's the only one with an accent and "looks creepy".<br /><br />at the very end (sorry to spoil, but this movie came out years ago so if you haven't seen it by now...) one of the women was found face down dead in the pool. this was the last straw!!!! vanessa angel, forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun, they struggle, the gun fires and now she's dead too!!! while she's laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and it's all his fault. he gets him to sign over the magazine to him. once he does voila! all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at rex.<br /><br />oy! what a ridiculous movie. as someone else said; if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better!
