is this supposed to be serious? i hope not. this is one of the most pathetically hilarious movies i've ever seen. given that i picked it up for a buck on the "bad movies" shelf, it sure lives up to its spot in the shop. what can i say, the gore effects are spattered (pun-intended) all over the place, some looking quite real, some looking like a teddy bear that's had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. the music is some of the most horrible i've heard, the acting is one of the most amusing elements... must i continue? don't bother unless you've seen every other pathetic horror movie in the shop and this is all that's left.
