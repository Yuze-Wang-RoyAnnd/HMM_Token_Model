the bipolarity of this movie is maddening. one moment it's making fun of latin americans, american tourists and banana republics in general, the other it wants to be touching, with burned villages and orphans. even the serious revolutionary hero, becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point. but the comedy parts aren't even funny, because it's so obviously stolen from star wars. yes, star wars, the "hero" is basically a rogue with a heart of gold. add to this stereotypical sounds effects, latin americans who speak english with one another, and a villain that just disappears from the story. and whats the point? it's basically revolution propaganda with no resolution, and no planning (because, there is just no way these people can lead a country). the us government are bad guys, but who'll make money producing this? not some poor farmer, that's for sure.
