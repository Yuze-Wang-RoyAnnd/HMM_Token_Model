i discovered "the patriot" in a dvd-store and thought it could be a real action thriller. no, it's instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story. it's no doubt a cable-movie and not one for the theatre. fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti-virus against sleep. one thing came over: it was the nice country the film has been shot. you can really feel the american air but that's all. i hope for steven seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit. it is not a must see because i and my wife voted average 4/10.
