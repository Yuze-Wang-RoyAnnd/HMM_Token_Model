comedy? what's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions (by the time i turned it off) of alchoholics anonymous? set off by a woeful script of grunts and mumbles and drunken slurrings. served up with lashings of hollywood's religious "god will save you" redemption drivel another reviewer mentioned the "sassy dialogue" of tea leone - well i managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and i still haven't seen any sassy yet - in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than tea's character in this rubbish. tea is more stony faced and shows less emotion than keanu - in fact one wonders if she too isn't addicted to something - maybe botox her face is so wooden? save yourself from being killed with boredom from this film.
