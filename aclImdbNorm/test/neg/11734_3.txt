the original "psycho" (1960) is widely considered as alfred hitchcock's best work and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of all time. the decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore, a little puzzling.<br /><br />the cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. vince vaughn as norman bates was not a good choice for the lead. he is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as bates. i can imagine actors such as mark wahlberg or john turturro doing a much better job in the role. anne heche as marion crane does a creditable job, but one keeps mentally comparing her to janet leigh. julianne moore is a much better actress than she shows here and viggio mortenson merely walks through his role. the best of this new cast is william h. macy as the private detective.<br /><br />although director gus van sant does an acceptable job, he can't build the suspense the way hitchcock did. and why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? in the original, the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed in, whereas in this version, it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory like setting. and i think the black & white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version.<br /><br />maybe another flaw could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when.<br /><br />all i can say is if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br /><br />
