can this "film" be considered as a film? imagine the situation: somebody puts a handy cam over a tripod and in front of a sea promenade and film people walking or jogging along it. then, he places the camera in a beach, buys some ducks in a pet shop, open their cages and let them run in front of the camera. later, he just films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in an absolute darkness. is it an experiment or just an insult to the audience intelligence? what would it happen if any unknown director did a film like that? would we mark his job with 10? i always disappoint directors who believe that can do everything they want once they became famous.
