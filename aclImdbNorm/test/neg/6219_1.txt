this movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an abba soundtrack - yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing. the musical presentations in the movie, southpark, was much better than in mama mia. the director of mama mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need are abba songs.<br /><br />just to give a sample of the awfulness: an aging meryl streep is shot with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. why do that to one of the most talented actresses out there?
