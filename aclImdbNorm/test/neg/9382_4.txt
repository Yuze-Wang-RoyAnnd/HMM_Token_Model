it starts quite good, but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. but after they transfered to capitalistic country, here it is, czech unofficial but well known mentality ... copying ... copying ... copying of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. i think that this is a good example of making "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "film" and money. and it remains me of the /one flew over the cuckoo's nest/, which can not be compared to this film in the way of art and actors and story and politics. i think this film is boring. it could be done better. at least, they tried. sorry guys. :-( canot not recommend
