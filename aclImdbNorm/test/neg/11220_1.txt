this movie is so bad, they wouldn't buy it back at my local used cd/dvd store. i only own it because it came in a box set which i bought for the masterpiece "deadfall". the store bought back the other two movies i was selling from the four disc set, but they wouldn't buy back underworld, and those other two movies redefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? so i tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget dvds that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back underworld either. this movie is bad on every level, and is one of those that came out in the post-tarantino-clone glut of the mid 90's. the only slightly redeemable element is dennis leary telling joe montegna, that he's a "stinky friend" and calls him "mister stinky friend". that line is so delightfully horrible, that i can't help but quote it at least once a week when describing a stinky friend. but now that i've enlightened you with that quote, you don't have to go thru the pain of watching this movie.
