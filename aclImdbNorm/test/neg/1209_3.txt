it's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once, but four times! most movies require a certain `suspension of reality' to enjoy, but this one takes it just too far. the basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a `middle eastern' country. the us government drags its feet in recovering him, leading the pilot's son (doug masters) to attempt a rescue mission.<br /><br />the problem i have with the movie is that it depicts the us air force as one colossal joke. in the movie you'll find that doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two f-16's, all the munitions, the fuel, the intel for the mission, and so on. security on this base seems to be a joke. nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old kid is fully qualified to pilot an f-16!<br /><br />if that wasn't enough, you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right, since people like to see things `blow up'. not so! several times in the movie, doug fires off aim-9 missiles on ground targets. aim stands for `air intercept missile', meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the air. he also fires off 15-20 missiles, where the maximum an f-16 can hold is 6 aim-9's. the movie also lacks continuity. you'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. also, 20mm doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! an f-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20mm, and it's mostly used for self-defense.<br /><br />i could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but i won't bore you. if you're in the mood to see a good air force movie, your choices are rather slim. most military movies deal either with the army, navy or marines. until hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the lines of `saving private ryan' or `a few good men', we'll be forced to watch movies like the `iron eagle' series.<br /><br />
