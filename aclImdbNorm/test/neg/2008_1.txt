well it is about 1,000 years in the future and we have finally breached traveling the vast distance between galaxies!! but sadly we still use guns that shoot bullets, black men are still calling each other brothers, and getting high, stoned, fighting etc.. common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the short end of the stick! babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they're from baywatch share close quarters with the captian and crew. crippled people still require wheelchairs to move, no fancy cures, implants, or robotic legs. dracula still looks and acts gay. need i go on... in short this move was shot on a typical sci-fi set low budget props, actors, and no real special effects to speak of. the beginning, the middle, and the ending was pathetic. i have to go off and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for.
