having been a godzilla fan for many years, gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of toho's #1 kaiju star. attack of the monsters was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience.<br /><br />last weekend, i attended the annual godzilla fest, known as g-fest, where carl craig, one of the stars of gamera vs. viras, made an appearance. of course, they featured this movie. it was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. of course, you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. in one scene, for example, the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens. when they realize they"ve been duped, one of them says, "that's funny...i think those kids lied to us." not even plan nine from outer space can boast that kind of dialog.<br /><br />this may not be godzilla or even gamera 3, but this one is a decent enough time waster, if you watch it in the right frame of mind.<br /><br />however, if you want top quality kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released gamera 3.<br /><br />rating: **1/2 out of *****
