the synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives. i like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of "chocolat" with a less fairy tale and more bite. what i got was a cast of despicable characters.<br /><br />for a character-driven movie to be effective, i need to feel a connection or compassion for the people. there was no one with whom i could relate in the movie. grazia (golino, whose work i admired in "rain man") portrays a mentally ill, probably bipolar, female that is often rude, aggressive and violent. her husband bickers and yells, when he is not hitting or slapping someone. the children are rude brats. they yell at each other and the females in the movie. they attack other children with no provocation. violence begets violence. this seems to be an island of unfeeling, aggressive, violent and rude people all the way around.<br /><br />the direction is not compelling. there are intermixed scenes that attempt to be art, but instead bore the viewer. the location is exceptionally gorgeous, but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film.<br /><br />i would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.
