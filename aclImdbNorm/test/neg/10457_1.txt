if you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (i guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash), you can't do better than this! the plot is inane, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see! 4 thumbs down! wooohoooooooo!!! seriously, i have no idea how the director and the "actors" can sleep at night! it's painful, and yet hysterically funny, to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something. if you can watch this crap without wincing, you're a better man than i'll ever be! i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself (and his money) into!
