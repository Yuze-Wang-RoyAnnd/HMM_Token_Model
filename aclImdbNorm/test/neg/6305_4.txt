a romp across a disbelieving outback, this outragous adventure enchants through it's downright brazeness. comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions - as drama from crisis. perhaps a little too queenie for some - i would love to have watched in a cinema audience in the outback. shockingly good
