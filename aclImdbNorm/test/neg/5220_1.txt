this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. what were they thinking. stop preaching to me already! this is why all of us watch walker texas ranger and wont admit it to our friends. terrible acting and a extremely phony plot. while the movie is unfolding the story stops and the actors start preaching to the audience. the director somehow believed the two meshed well. it looked like crap! when i saw the title at my local blockbusters it looked interesting. their should have been a warning on it saying it was religious instead of the false advertisement of an action / adventure. first time in a long time i stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate finishing it.
