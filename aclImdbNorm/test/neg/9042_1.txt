uuuuaaa! barf! yuk! yuk! disgusting! puke city! worst piece of junk ever made. sick. weird. horrible. enough said. hold your nose. don't eat. after seeing this sick, demented, garbage pail of a movie, you won't be able to eat your food for a week. but, maybe that's good. a new diet has been invented. go to see this vomit inducing film. get sick to your stomach. and you will be so turned off by the whole mess, that you can't eat for at least a week, and you drop about 15 pounds.<br /><br />me me lay! with a name like this, it's really amazing that she doesn't have a "cult" fan following. she rates as the worst actress ever. her films make ed woods look like gone with the wind. this movie rates a minus 10.
