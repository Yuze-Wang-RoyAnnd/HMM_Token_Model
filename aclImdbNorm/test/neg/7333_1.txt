a man wonders if his hunky co-worker is gay. at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called "gaydar". you point it at a person, pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are. he tries it out, it works and he sets out to find out if his coworker is gay like him...<br /><br />promising idea ruined by an unfunny script (after a promising beginning) and terrible acting. the entire cast overacts and basically scream their lines at each other constantly. it gets annoying and really embarassing after a while. the saving grace is that's it is short, there's a scene stealing cat (love her fall out of the kitty bed) and charles nelson reilly is hysterical in his brief bit. but none of this saves the movie. i can't recommend this at all.
