i vaguely remember this film. i do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that i have ever walked out on!! and since then i have never seen it available to rent anywhere!! i can't spoil it for anyone cos i can barely remember it!! to think, looking at the cast, it seemed a winner, with john landis directing, but good god, they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel!! all i can seem to recall is that the dad goes missing and the family try to search for him, by trying to put an actual photograph into the disc drive of a computer. i walked out after about half an hour of this. i must confess though, i'd love to see if i can get a copy, just to see if it really was that bad!!<br /><br />it wouldn't surprise me if this was on every actor's black list! i mean christopher lee was in this?? the legend of all bad guys, who'd been in star wars and lord of the rings?? as i said - black listed movie, the stupids!
