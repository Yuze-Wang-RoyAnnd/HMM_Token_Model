close but no cigar! - that's what my opinion of this film is! tag purvis both wrote and directed this script which should have gone through a re write before shooting. at times, laughable because or a corny script, this film's shining star is dan mongomery jr and the director of photography. both of these talents are ones to watch out for in the future. my recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable station and use the rental money on a classic!
