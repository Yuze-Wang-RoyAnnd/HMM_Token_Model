"quintet" is definitely not a film most people would find amusing or even interesting for that matter. there is no scene, dialog, acting or plot development that would light a spark. the icy world is one thing, but muddled plot is something you really can't bear. the characters are not only three-dimensional, they're not even one-dimensional, there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that goes on. there is a world encased in ice, where nobody is doing any meaningful work, except playing quintet, and the rules to the game are never even hinted. the homes are not heated, even there is electricity, but who and what produces it? there is wood, but there are no animals, except dogs, so where do clothes come from, or shoes for that matter, since, apparently there is no industry, and everybody is dressed as in 16th century europe, which is in odd contrast to not so futuristic pavilion backdrop. the entire movie seams to be stuck inside altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with audience. desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with lack of appeal to this movie, the world of george lucas's "thx1138" is no brighter place and characters are no more fun, but the story has it's path. in quintet, there is no obvious or even hinted path, and in my opinion it doesn't even provoke thinking about the idea behind it all, as, for example, similar film, john boorman's "zardoz". it's not even done in altman's unique style, so it doesn't appeal to his fans,either, and i'm one of them. all in all, robert altman had a dream, and he woke up without telling anybody what it meant, not even to him.
