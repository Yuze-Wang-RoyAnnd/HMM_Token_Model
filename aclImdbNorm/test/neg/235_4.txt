first of all, i wasn't sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn't understand and find boring. there wasn't really much to it, bruce willis wasn't stretched as an actor at all. he did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his i wouldn't bother. and if it's the story you're interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child), i would go to see about a boy. it has everything this film lacked, humor, sadness and reality.
