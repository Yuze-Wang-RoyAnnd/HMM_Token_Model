in terms of quality movies, this isn't one of them. it's actually the first chuck norris movie i've seen and i was left pretty underwhelmed. the fight scenes are slow and don't have a lot of variety. norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring. the movie also is quite short, but for some reason the movie doesn't even seem finished when it ends. it's a pretty anti-climatic ending. all the same though, i've watched a lot of bad movies, and this isn't one of the worst that i've seen. it's worth a watch, i'm guessing especially for norris fans. there's also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie.
