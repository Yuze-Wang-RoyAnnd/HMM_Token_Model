the film has weird annoying characters, strange unexplainable slapstick, and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking. the movie has a contrived plot of a bitchy, empty-headed woman's (jeanne tripplehorn) search for love. although who would ever like jeanne's character, personality, or reading of the dialogue, i really cannot say. except that she likes to smoke.<br /><br />sarah jessica parker gives an interesting character performance (who likes to smoke). dylan mcdermott does his best to look pretty and soulful (as he smokes). and, hey, what is jennifer aniston doing there? oh, she's not really in it enough for anyone to care about her. (but she likes to smoke).<br /><br />this is a waste of anyone's time. i don't even know how i was able to sit through as much of the movie as i did. i can't even believe i spent the time to write this, except to warn others of its banality. anyone need a cigarette?
