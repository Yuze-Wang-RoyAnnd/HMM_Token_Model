this is an excruciatingly boring, slow-moving movie. we can feel some sympathy for the socially- and sexually-inexperienced and awkward tomek, but the motivations of magda are pretty hard to see, and the ending, at least for me, was inscrutable. <br /><br />maybe it's about how we all need love, but i'd get more out of a good busby berkeley.<br /><br />i'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines, so i'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and institutions. i wonder if it's meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government.<br /><br />finally, watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in magda's stove.
