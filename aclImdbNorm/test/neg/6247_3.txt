hmmmmmmm - cheerleader massacre. let me think - high school girls get sliced up, except the cute one survives. got it. next movie.<br /><br />i was actually surprised this one was made in 2003. i really thought they quit making these movies in the 80's. this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy, dumb male horn dogs, even dumber male adult, and hot teacher. it continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods. we have seen it all before.<br /><br />however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me-too slashers, so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill - you could do worse.
