rs.30/- is all i paid as rent for the dvd of the movie and believe me it is not worth it.<br /><br />bollywood directors think that showing fools is funny? well it is not. please grow up.<br /><br />here goes a dialog from the movie -'agar tum ladkee ko ijjat doge to ladkee tumhe apni ijjat degi'.<br /><br />plot is useless, criminals and police alike running after fools. that is it. bhagam bhag.<br /><br />well it lived the title, i had to run away from it. :) i switched over to star movies and watched home alone 2 instead, and had a good laugh.
