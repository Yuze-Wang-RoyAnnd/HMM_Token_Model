the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it. i saw it for free at college. and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.<br /><br />stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles). i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie, but i have never seen anything more depressing. this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch (which has its opponents, but i enjoyed it very much). it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.<br /><br />you want a funny seuss adaptation? go with the grinch.
