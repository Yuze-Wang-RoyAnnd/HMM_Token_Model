i had to write a review for this film after i saw it last night and read some of the comments of people trying to classify the displeasure of this film go down to wfmitchell's post)). i don't fit any any of those classification. the other classification that needs to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it was not good. i found the film to be booring and forced. my wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge kidman fan and she also likes jude law.<br /><br />speaking of law, it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent. i can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose so we would't have to hear that tortured accent so much.<br /><br />as far as the movie, it took a long time for it to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat in it's ending. what was interesting, is that i did not know that this film was directed by minghella. about 40 minutes into the movie, i asked my wife "this isn't going to be another english patient is it?" it absolutely was.<br /><br />as far as the battle scenes. i'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but i think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply "dumb". it was forced, it was unbelievable, it was silly and it was dumb. (after the battle i looked at my wife and asked "was that just dumb?" to which she vigorously nodded her head).<br /><br />the only bright point in the film was the performance of zellweger. the role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. from her speech pattern, her walk, her mannerisms and esp. her little quips (my favorite: "if you want to get 3 feet up a bull's ass all you have to do is listen to sweethearts talk to each other"), she was able to create an almost cartoon-like character who did her job extremely well.<br /><br />i simply did not like this movie and i have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it (or the english patient for that matter). i suspect you could categorize them in one category: 1) soap opera fans
