bad script? check. awful effects? check. horrible actors? check. lame direction? check.<br /><br />after seeing the dvd box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, i placed my $4.28 on the line and rented this "film." my girlfriend was out of town and i was bored so on a late tuesday night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch, what appeared to be (based on the box cover art) a horror movie. what i got instead was the worst film ever made. up until that point i had always declared "slumber party massacre 3" the worst film ever made.<br /><br />if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is, this is for you. if you don't want to lose $4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, steer clear of this garbage.<br /><br />an added note: i noticed a few of the "actors" come on here and post comments on the bulletin board. how can you brag about being in this film? you were all horrible. i mean really bad. if there was an american idol for actors, you all would be laughed at in the first few episodes.<br /><br />peace.<br /><br />sutter cain
