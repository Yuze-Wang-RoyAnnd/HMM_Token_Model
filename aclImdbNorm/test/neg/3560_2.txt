i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a shill.<br /><br />the acting of the female lead is actually quite good, but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it. this is the very definition of dullness.<br /><br />so far, this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes. that must mean the director, director's girlfriend, producer, actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10.<br /><br />for the rest of you, who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story, avoid this.<br /><br />this man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10.<br /><br />fda note: while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep, no medicinal value is implied or offered.
