i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on "mystery science theater" have received a tons of low ratings on imdb. however, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the "mst" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. now i am not saying that "the girl in lover's lane" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current imdb score of 2.1.<br /><br />the film begins with bix and danny meeting. bix is a veteran drifter and danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country. once they blow into a small town, bix needs to rescue danny again and again because danny is quite naive--a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato.<br /><br />along the way, something happens to the self-assured bix--he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him. and, in an odd subplot, jack elam plays a super-creepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone--yet oddly, the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him. ultimately, however, when elam puts the moves on a girl who bix is falling for, things come to a full boil.<br /><br />overall, while not at all a great film, there were many interesting plot elements in this film--enough to merit a score higher than 2.1. the biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of danny one time too often. considering the minuscule budget, however, it's a watchable little film.
