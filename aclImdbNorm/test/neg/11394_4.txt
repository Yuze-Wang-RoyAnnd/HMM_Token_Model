the recent documentary "the adventures of errol flynn" is an in-depth look at the ultimate hollywood hero. bogart,cagney, wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. if he hadn't been under contract to warner bros. he would've of been perfect in the cary grant role in suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator. and he could've starred with his best leading ladies sister joan fontaine. that was flynn's trouble he was the ultimate screen hero until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him. grant and flynn in a way are similar but flynn was the more macho of the two;it is possible to see grant as captain blood but flynn in the philadelphia story mr. blanding builds his dream house,or monkey business,or operation petticoat would've turned those roles on their collective ears because he's too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would've brought naturally would've made the story lines wobbly. but this wobbly biography is just a plasticized view of flynn and his era. there are times when i half expected a laugh track or an audience to go "ahhh" at some point. it doesn't go deeply into flynn's life just the screen magazine view. it also doesn't delve into his struggle to be considered more than a derring-doer. like the cleaned up biographies of lon chaney( the father,not the wolfman,or lenny"of mice and men) and buster keaton done in the '50's this is just a time killing piece of fluff
