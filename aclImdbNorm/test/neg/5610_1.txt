if only the writer/producer/"star" had the slightest inkling of the limits of his acting range, and the way he is perceived on-screen (wearing glasses and a side-parting is not enough to make you look gawky and quirky if your face and teeth have been sculpted by various medical professionals to conform to american ideals of generic, characterless symmetry, erroneously perceived as beauty in this obsessively superficial society) he would have cast john heder as the main character instead of attempting to pull a good-will-hunting and create a vehicle to showcase his... his... well, himself.<br /><br />the excellent supporting cast (lord knows, they must be having problems to agree to this) is wasted in an agonising perpetual struggle to react convincingly to a main character incapable of delivering even the simplest line with appropriate intonation, and believe me, he is not short of simple lines to choose from, as the dialogue appears to have been composed by a five-year-old. ah wait... it's the same person pretending to be a writer as pretending to be an actor. it's not often that i don't see a film through to the end, but this ejaculation was irredeemable from the outset and showed no signs of improving after the first hour. excrement.
