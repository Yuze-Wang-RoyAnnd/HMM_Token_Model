this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd. i loved those six movies. they were well-acted, well-scripted, and historically accurate. i did actually read gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's huge historical inaccuracies (i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention that. that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book. <br /><br />above all this movie just leaves me asking "why?" why do we see, as someone else aptly put, "the real world: tudor england"? why are the camera angles so bad in general? <br /><br />why is the script so bad? i mean, i know it was improv, but come on! the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it's obvious that they're making them up as they go along.<br /><br />why are the sex scenes so awkward? the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting. in the movie they're just bad, verging on being absolutely hilarious. at one point, the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii. he's thrusting away and she's got this look on her face that says "hm....i need to go to the store. is he done yet? maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick..." it's just bad.<br /><br />why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie? her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom. she's the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn't get immediately married. why is she not present here? over all, this movie is just bad.
