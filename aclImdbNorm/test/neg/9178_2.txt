fred "the hammer" williamson delivers another cheaply made movie. he might have set a new standard for himself. look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible in the street during a chase scene. you don't see it just once, you see it several times. look for the out of focus shot in one scene and the camera operator try to fix it as the scene rolls on. watch this with a group of people and make your own mystery science theater!
