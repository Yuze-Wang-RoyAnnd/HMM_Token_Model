"the brotherhood of satan" is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (bernard mceveety). it all starts out with father charles bateman (as ben) driving out west with his pretty blondes: luscious ahna capri (as nicky), and daughter geri reischl (as k.t.). things get weirder and weirder for the trio, as they approach the town of hillsboro, which is being gripped by a satanic cult! <br /><br />when the dullish travelers hit hillsboro, the "action" switches to the film's more interesting assemblage of characters: townies l.q. jones (as pete, the sheriff), strother martin (as doc), charles robinson (as jack, the priest), and alvy moore (as tobey). their interplay is sometimes fun. soon enough, it all gets very silly, and predictable. mr. martin is the stand-out (as you might expect); he considers the possibility of a satanic cult to be a "cock-and-bull story", but is (of course) their leader. the "come in, children" ending is puzzling; unless, perhaps, it was the film's original title.
