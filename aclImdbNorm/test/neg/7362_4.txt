see.. i really wanted to enjoy this movie. there were moments when my heart beat faster, when the hair on my neck began to stand up, when my muscles began to tighten.. but just like a strip tease, i was left with no real action, no resolution, and money missing from my wallet.<br /><br />jaume balaguer'o and miguel tejada-flores apparently don't know the correct recipe for making a horror movie, and as such, utilized the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything into the pot.<br /><br />this movie is really the shining, poltergeist, amityville, and hellraiser all rolled into one. amazing, i know, but true. all the flavors are there, you can taste each of them, they just don't mix well. i'm not gonna go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie; in short, good cinematography, mediocre acting, worse dialogue.<br /><br />the -real- problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie, aside from the resulting confusion, is while you can have several plots running at one time, you can't have several endings. and what does jaume do when he runs into this problem? just like a freshman in english 101, you end your story with ellipses, "the little car vanished into the darkness and ..... the end" oooh, spooky. not really. and very anticlimactic. the ending left me confused and disappointed; almost empty.<br /><br />take your $10, go rent the shining, poltergeist, and hellraiser.. scare the pants off yourself, have a great time, and forget that the darkness ever existed. <br /><br />-bjamin
