this movie reminded me a lot of a song by the dead kennedys called "straight a's." however, unlike this film, the hero of the dk's song turns to suicide. you'll wish this bozo had resorted to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did. the whole thing was convoluted and in the beginning, you sympathize with the hero of the film, then he quickly betrays your sympathies. the long sequences of just showing the hero's face while he delivers a monologue drag the film down quite a bit. avoid this if possible.
