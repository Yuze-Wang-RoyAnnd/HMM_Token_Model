only saw this movie late last night. i remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had i viewed it back then i maybe wouldn't have been so generous. i hate hype, it can ruin a movie. i think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on woody. he was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. it never went too deep. redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. to me he should have been more confrontational with demi - throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for. after all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - that's not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone. he was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet demi fell for him? the passages giving an insight to demi and woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. there was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of john gages character. he really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded i think the movies draw-card was redford and they didn't want tarnish his "image". i say what the hell robert was old in this movie! woody and demi's characters were naive in a sense, but i think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision. but the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go? las vegas? to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. i found their naivety when redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic. the movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that on late night tv - it was enjoyable and i if you don't think too much - also palatable
