this movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are not worth the wait. after an unexplained argument between two guys picking up litter in a drive-in movie theatre we cut to a family leaving! hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over. at least i think it's inane, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loud it renders the dialogue at times almost inaudible. <br /><br />finally the camper van arrives, at night, at a gas station where the family get out, have another inane conversation, before driving off. the camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away. he talks straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him, and how he came to make the movie.<br /><br />a nice idea which almost (but not quite) makes the previous sequences worth the pain.<br /><br />as the movie unfolds he encounters the two characters we met picking litter at the start of the movie and they all form a motion picture company.<br /><br />all sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues as they put together a crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming.<br /><br />this movie was obviously put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost. comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking (or shouting) at once. so much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously - robert altman can do this sort of thing well because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound techies, and editing facilities. everyone shouting at the one mike which, by the sound of it, was hidden in a dustbin in the next room, does not make for clarity.
