yes. it takes a norwegian to ruin and slaughter two great books and a concept that would work well on film - this film truly is the worst swedish film of all time. i hated it so badly that i even considered walking out on it, something i have never done. but it was so awful i was almost compelling. i just had to sit through to the end. much like some early-80's stallone action reel, this one really takes swedish action back to the stone-age. so full of logical errors and stupid mistakes it is almost amusing - but who could ever see anything good in the terrible acting, mark hamill's surviving a mine-field or the dumb-ass, useless and irrational action?<br /><br />let me ask you: aren't we through with clocks ticking down to zero, the hero escaping in the nick of time and two friends become enemies reuniting by the end? stupid!!!!<br /><br />and one more thing: the product placement in this film is unbelievable. while other countries have understood that it shouldn't be so obvious, the swedish film industry apparently hasn't understood at all: just look at the credit card hamilton uses to open a window? or or or.... this film really makes me mad.
