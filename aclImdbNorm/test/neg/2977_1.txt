even though i tried to avoid german films recently, positive reviews lured me into renting this one. there i stand fooled again by german media which has been hyping domestic flicks over and over again. to me it is no wonder no one abroad wants to see this crap. the idea to make this film is no idea at all (i guess some fool read a women's magazine article about speed-dating). in short: the characters (which are none), dialogue and content are so stunningly trivial, trite and clich'e-ridden, i continued watching because i could hardly believe what i saw. btw to call the flat theses mechanically delivered by the figures (certainly from the aforementioned magazines) dialogue, would be simply incorrect. acting is so over-the-top, i can't remember worse than that on screen in a long time. you have to guess the director had/has no clue at all. amazingly distributors and producers around the country are still wondering why german films (with rare exceptions) generate no interest world-wide. why? because it's waste of time and money.
