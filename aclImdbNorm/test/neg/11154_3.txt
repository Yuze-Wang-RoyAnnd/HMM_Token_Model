what does this movie have? lots of gunfire and expensive effects. nothing makes sense on any other level.<br /><br />watching arnold cry is seeing acting so bad that it is laughable. the plot is ludicrous.<br /><br />if you think the devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a machine gun, well, this movie is for you!
