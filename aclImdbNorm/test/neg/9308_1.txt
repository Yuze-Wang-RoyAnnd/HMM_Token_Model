yahoo serious is like a $3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. this film proves he is completely toxic. we can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures. it is right up there with "lightning jack" and "les patterson saves the world" as the most abysmal example of australian comedy imaginable. how tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in australia yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy. and to think - he had 7 years to come up with the script. true genius!
