little quentin seems to have mastered the art of having the cake and eating it.<br /><br />as usual, the pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever thought-provoking way of sending violence back into the audience's face.<br /><br />sure, mr tarantino. violence is baaad. sadism is baaad. it is well worth wading in it to make that point. how very brilliant.<br /><br />the juvenile part of the audience may well not be clever enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness though, but i'm confident they'll see the light one day.<br /><br />thanks for making this little world of ours a little better. you deserve a medal.
