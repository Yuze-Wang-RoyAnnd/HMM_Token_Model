rent this only movie if you're in the mood for laughs (for sheer stupidity) , as this movie wouldn't scare a bunch of kindergartners at a halloween party! the trouble is, there is too much gore for kiddies, so definitely don't put this in your vcr for the toddlers. it starts off with a little bit of promise, giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover, but then descends quickly into epic stupidity. the "killer scarecrows" are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the wizard of oz, but not quite as smart. if they'd only had a brain...? i got this movie for $1.20 at a local discount/close-out store and even so, i feel somewhat ripped off. i think with all the other comments posted here, if you actually pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.
