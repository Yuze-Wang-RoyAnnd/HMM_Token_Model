the movie was awful. the production company should be required to pay a fine for wasting electricity transmitting this nonsense.<br /><br />there were too many holes in the plot. why would the doj send a killer out to assassinate a world leader? if they weren't the doj, why would they send someone they thought would not do the job? to quote butch cassidy, "who are those guys?" apparently, the director does not know either because he never told us.<br /><br />the characters were unbelievable. they did not behave in any way that seemed to fit who they allegedly were. with the exception of the doctor, none of the characters were particularly compelling or likeable.<br /><br />if you want to waste money on the electricity required to watch this movie, feel free. otherwise, run the opposite direction.
