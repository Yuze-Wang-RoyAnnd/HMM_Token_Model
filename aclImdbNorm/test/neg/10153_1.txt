i got this on a double feature dvd called "scream theater" and it's no doubt one of the most terrible movies i've ever seen. and i've seen some really bad ones. school's out, and of three girls (who if they're teenagers i'd eat my hat) are talking about "non-stop party", so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party. meanwhile, a psychotic has escaped the local bug-house where one girl's father works & is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs, and sporting wide-open eyes...i guess that's to show he's bonkers. of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house, the location of which is apparently common knowledge. in the meantime, some dumb-jock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls, and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats. and that's about it, as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background. or, maybe that's not it, but really, that's all you need to know. unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk, you'll find little of interest here, and even if you are wasted most of the time, you'll still probably find your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10.
