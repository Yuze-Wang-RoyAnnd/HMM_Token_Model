in the real world of art elizabeth wurtzel is the sexy drama queen every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up next to. her on-screen portrayer, christina ricci, is the ugly artsy wannabe girl that desperately wants every and any guy, but no guy will touch her. that's why, in prozac nation, the unreleased 2001 film of wurtzel's 1990s bestseller book of the same name, there are immediate problems. ok, the problems start before the miscast of ricci, who has the emotional range of a thimble- is it any wonder that, by far, her finest acting was in the two addams family films? first off, she is bizarre looking- with big eyes and a bulging forehead, making her look like the fetal starchild from 2001: a space odyssey. secondly, she always plays whiney brats. but, thirdly, is the way films try to make it appear any guy would be attracted to her. in one scene in the film her pal ruby (michelle williams) and liz walk through harvard, and all the guys' tongues are wagging at ricci, not the super-cute and sexy williams. hello
