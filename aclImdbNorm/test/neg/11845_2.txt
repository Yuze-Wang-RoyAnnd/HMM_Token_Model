the biggest and most disconcerting things of the raptor movie was ending for the tyransaurus is identical to carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. the similarities to the carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. then the plot went down hill from there. would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. the raptor movie should have taken lesson from jurasic park series in various plots. the only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is aztec rex. the repeated scenes as if taken from the carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies.
