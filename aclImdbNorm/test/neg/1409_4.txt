i was aware of man of the year's critical pans and unremarkable gross, but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because i know good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall months.<br /><br />what i found out was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired. surprising is an understatement considering barry levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in good morning vietnam and wag the dog) and robin williams' obvious comic gifts. robin williams, in fact, is mysteriously underused. on the "making of" featurette that comes with the dvd, barry levinson talked about how sometimes he let robin williams improvise off the script, like it was some naughty secret of his. um
