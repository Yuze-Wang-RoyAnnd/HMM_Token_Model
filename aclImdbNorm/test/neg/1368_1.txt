i saw this movie when it was first released in pittsburgh pa. i had traveled from youngstown ohio, a distance of approx. 85 miles. i knew nothing of the plot nor the players. i had read no reviews nor had i talked to anyone who had seen it. believe me i will never make that mistake again. it was being touted i believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3d process. that was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />there was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (i kid you not) 2 or 2 1/2  blocks long and moving very slowly. i could hardy wait to be seated. if i had only known at that moment what i soon would know, i could have been  3/4  of the way back to youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />by the time the first 3d scene was shown, i was already nodding off. the novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />without going into excruciating detail, i can only offer the following advice. if you have ever seen the famous film plan nine from outer space, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />i don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has i don't know why. if you ever get a chance to see it, do something else. take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose. anything. your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />this has been my first movie review. it might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and i wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />bill<br /><br />
