nothing carson daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh, or even smile a little. i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years.<br /><br />even the "funny" band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him. daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys. it seems like they don't even try to be a little funny.<br /><br />awful awful awful show.<br /><br />it makes my soul cry.<br /><br />i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is. don't watch it. but if you absolutely have to, i recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand.
