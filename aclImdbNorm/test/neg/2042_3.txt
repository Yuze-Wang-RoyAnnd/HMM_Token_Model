i just can't get it, freaks out on the planet are talking about this one as a must seen, they even dare to call it a (s)exploitation because the possessed girl is seducing priests and is masturbating all time. don't let me laugh. i watched the movie, seducing is only at the end of the movie and don't call it seducing,it's just bad language that's she is talking. and the masturbationscene is a big laugh too, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you perverts out there. it isn't gory or bloody at all, everybody is vomiting on beyond the door, well, let me tell, that one is for me better than this flick. only the last 5 minutes the possessed one is vomiting and having weird eyes. if i had know that this is so bad then i would never caught me a copy. if you really wan't to see a (s)exploiation about exorcism watch angel above, the devil below or other cheesy ones. a waist of time this is.
