everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends/family who had a stake in the film, and that's okay - if i'd made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it, too. in all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. good: the overall plot was mildly interesting. the music was overall pretty good. several of the songs (when you could hear them) were actually pretty cool. the only musical issues i had were: #1) the first suspense scene with some sort of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to take away from the suspense), #2) the song being played when the lead characters went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and #3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while danny trejo hung a man (sounded like a pretty cool song, but it should have ripped out across the scene when danny trejo got froggy). now for the completely bad stuff: the script was atrocious. i mean, horrible. i've seen smoother dialogue in a star wars movie. advice to the writer from a part-time writer and full-time movie buff: when you write dialogue, ask yourself, "is this something that people would actually say?" honestly, the script was laughable. i want to slam the acting, but with that kind of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. the mildly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the crappy dialogue. i know it was low-budget, but words don't cost money - if you have a good script, even semi-competent actors can pull it off. this movie didn't seem to have either, but hopefully the director will get a second shot at making a better film.
