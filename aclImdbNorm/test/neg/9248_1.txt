... or should i say unintentionally hilarious? either way, this is one of the best comedies i've seen in a long time. i was laughing throughout at the antics of some of the dumbest fictional characters this side of homer simpson. it's just one forehead-slapping, painfully stupid scene after another as the clownish, dim-witted cardboard cutouts substituting for actual humanoid characters push, pull, and drag the "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion.<br /><br />if i had to describe this movie to someone, i'd call it a mutated hybrid of fatal attraction, dumb and dumber, and the three stooges, with a "climax" uncannily similar to the episode of family guy in which the whole family gets into a knock-down fistfight in the living room.<br /><br />advice to benson family: next time you get a new pet, do the poor animal a favor and don't name it fred!
