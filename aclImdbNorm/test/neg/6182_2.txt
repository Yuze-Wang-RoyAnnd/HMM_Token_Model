big disappointment. clash by night is much to talky and stagy and the dialog doesn't resonate as true coming from these characters. this is melodrama at its peak. the acting is truly over the top and very unreal. only marilyn monroe and keith andes as supporting players give this film any zip. wish they had more to do. i'm somebody who looks at details in films. two big questions...1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working, then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father? 2. when stanwyck is packing to leave town, why is she seen packing at her brothers place where she hasn't lived for at least two years? also, when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre, who's taking care of the baby again? such details really irritate me and cause me to give films much lower ratings. what were the writers, directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking? nuf' said.
