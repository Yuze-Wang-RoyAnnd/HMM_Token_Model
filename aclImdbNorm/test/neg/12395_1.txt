college students (who are actually in their late 20's) on campus in boston (which looks strangely like the isle of man) are menaced by a fierce monster (assembled during a blue peter episode). the new teacher must save the day (even though he is really... oh, who cares?)<br /><br />i'll start with the positives... there is a nice shot of eastenders new gal samantha janus's can in the obligatory campus shower scene with her best mate katy lawrence. a bit of side trivia: katy was hired when she arrived at auditions with her sister, just as moral support to her sibling but ended up landing a part. oh, joy. picked from obscurity to... flash her pert buttocks in a meaningless scene added for titillation, then getting killed 30 minutes in for her troubles. her latest (and only other credited role) is as probationary nurse #5 in atonement. i wonder if she snuck a look at keira knightly (if extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondered: where did it all go wrong?!<br /><br />i'll give a few hints katy: if all the other british cast members are asked to speak with american accents in a doomed attempt at mass-marketing, and the only person who can manage it is the b-movie veteran usa native todd jensen, you know you're in trouble. if you look at your wage slip and it'll only just about cover your lunch and your bus ride home, you ain't starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. if the premiere is attended by loads of family members of the fourth assistant director and provokes gales of laughter when the stickyback tape monster rampages through the sewers, it should dawn on you that this isn't exactly alien. or even a critters iv, come to think of it. so katy, in your next life (i'm a buddhist, you see) perhaps you'll be a bit more selective in your choice of debut feature rather than impulsively jumping at the first pile of crap that heads your way. flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long lasting success. unless you're sylvester stallone. and he had the script to rocky to back him up.<br /><br />to all intents and purposes this is as 0/10 a movie as i've ever seen. however, for sheer unintentional laughs and pure camp value, it gets a 1. well done ;)
