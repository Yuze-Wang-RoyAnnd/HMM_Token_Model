feeling minnesota, directed by steven baigelmann, and starring keanu reeves, cameron diaz and vincent d'onofrio: the strained relationship between two brothers, sam (d'onofrio) and jjaks (reeves), is pushed to breaking point when jjaks arrives at sam's wedding and makes off with the bride, freddie (diaz), a former stripper, marrying sam to repay a gambling debt owed to night-club owner red (lindo). baigelman's writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess, full of hateful characters and lacking coherence. putting keanu and diaz in the same movie should at least provide some eye candy, but baigelman even cops out on that score, grudging his actors up with little positive effect. very poor.
