don't kill me fans but i have something to say about this.<br /><br />pros: well, the most mildly interesting season that i've watched out of all the seasons that are out there of inuyasha just has tobe the shichinintai arc. unlike the rest of the seasons, i personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries; good god they're such likable characters. shame they were killed off. of course, i would write a 15 page essay one why i like the shichinintai so much but that would be boring for some of you. so this series actually does have some likable characters. i'll miss bankotsu... poor, poor psycho little boy.<br /><br />cons: outside of shichinintai arc, the series was overall boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating. kagome for example: she overreacts too much to my taste; she acts like yuka from elfen lied. inuyasha: he's a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword. what's so unique about him? he has adorable dog ears! tch. sesshomaru is all talk, no action and very cocky. naraku has just got to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the anime world. miroku and sango... they have some color but they just seem to stand on the sidelines too much. but what bugs me the most if the fact that they have absolutely no common sense at all. rumiko takahashi has done a lot better then this. i've seen it before.<br /><br />if you like series with a lot of action, no annoying love triangle, no over repetitiveness, this is not for you then.
