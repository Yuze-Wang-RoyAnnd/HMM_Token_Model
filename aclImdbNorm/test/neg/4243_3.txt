it really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie. the beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. the partisan "af" was started in 1943 when two communist pilots from the croat ustashi af deserted, together with their observers, in breguet 19 and potez 33, respectively. the aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand-bombing, but didn't last very long. one crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot being killed later while flying a spitfire vc. the real partisan squadrons were established when raf detached two of its (yugoslav) squadrons of spitfire vc and, hurricane iic , respectively, manned by ex yugoslav royal airforce pilots, and allotted them to tito's forces on the island of vis. even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. so the film was one giant cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its, otherwise not at all bad, director. by some quirk of fate i was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie, when dozens of german aircraft were destroyed (yugoslav 522 trainers, used also in the flying sequences) on the mostar military airport. the pyrotechnics were impressive, and the scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better. otherwise, the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience.
