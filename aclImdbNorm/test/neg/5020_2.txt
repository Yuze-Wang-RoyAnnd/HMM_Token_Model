first off i want to say that i lean liberal on the political scale and i found the movie offensive. i managed to watch the whole doggone disgrace of a film . this movie brings a low to original ideas. yes it was original thus my 2 stars instead of 1. are our film writers that uncreative that they can only come up with this?? acting was horrible , and the characters were unlikeable for the most part. the lead lady in the story had no good qualities at all. they made her bf into some sort of a bad guy and i did not see that at all. maybe i missed something , i do not know.he was the most down to earth, relevant character in the movie. i did not shell out any money for this garbage. i almost wish peta would come to the rescue of this awful, offensive movie and form a protest. disgusting thats all i have to say anymore !
