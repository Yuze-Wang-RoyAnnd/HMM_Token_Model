words cannot express how poor this film is.<br /><br />there is no plot, the acting is appalling, basically the whole film is a joke.<br /><br />with a running time of 97 minutes, it's about 96 minutes too long.<br /><br />it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show, but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in.<br /><br />avoid this one, go rent a good movie instead!
