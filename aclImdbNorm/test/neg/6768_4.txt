i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. the gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like dillinger. seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties. there is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. the most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where ma barker and her sons are shooting it out with the fbi and the sons are killed. the narrator says something like " perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, ma barker became a real mother". this is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. a very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.
