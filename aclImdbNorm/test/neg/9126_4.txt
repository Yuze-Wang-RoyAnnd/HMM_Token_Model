the final frames of the original "american graffiti" provide one-line summaries of the fates of the film's four central male characters. while somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters, the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the movie would want. however, someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by detailing the dreary lives of these characters after the original film ended. bad move. making an insurance salesman and his wife, a nerdy private in vietnam, a drag race driver, and a overgrown hippie into interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this nearly unwatchable movie. while most of the original cast is back, with only richard dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, "more american graffiti" is a mess of silly situations that involve protests, car races, country singers, and the vietnam war. the use of split screens, once thought innovative and daring, is overused here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused goings one. this is a sequel that demonstrates nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel. perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson. even the use of period music, which was a delight in the original, is poorly done here. if you want more "american graffiti," see the original twice.
