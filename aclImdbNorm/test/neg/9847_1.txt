this movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. the problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level; which is why it failed to build a decent story around them. i couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why i should care.<br /><br />this movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all. it's basically about a girl being in love with her sister, and her sister being in love with the idea of "men". while the latter tries out her love of men, the former tries to win her sister back by "getting even".<br /><br />the plot is weak, the characters are weak, and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur porn filmmaker (without the sexual substance).
