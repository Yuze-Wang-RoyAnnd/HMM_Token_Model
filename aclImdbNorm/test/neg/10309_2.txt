don't worry when looking at the cover of the dvd, sandra bullock only appears at most 5 minutes in total in this cult classic. the entertainment value here is very high. <br /><br />to name but a few of the many highlights that should be paid attention to:<br /><br />- the doubled evil voices of the chief bad guys - the special gun cam - the weird masks and outfits of the hit killers - the showy ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground - the abundance of bottom-up shots - the spacey scene in which bullock falls unconscious on the street - the over-clich'e italian mob guy moe (lamotta) - the cheap synthesizer background music - the mesmerizing overdone gun fetishism<br /><br />and last but not least: the super corny fist-fight scenes. wish there would have been more of those...<br /><br />extra point for the successful attempt at making me laugh out loud.
