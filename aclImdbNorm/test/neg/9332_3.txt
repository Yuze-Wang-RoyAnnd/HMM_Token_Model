mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours. the only thing that saves this film from god's wreath (and there is only one god, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialog, and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie. for most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking; the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by mst3k.<br /><br />george sanders is absolutely awful; one of the most animated, overly-theatrical performances i've ever seen. brynner isn't much better; his stiff, wooden acting, combined with the horrendous fortune-cookie wisdom utterings make for a rather boring and silly solomon. it seems that every time brynner opens his mouth something oh-so wise and ridiculously high-and-mighty comes out. to an extent it's not sanders's and brynner's fault, because of the crappy, comical dialog and the typically biblical one-dimensional characterization, but they made little effort otherwise. brynner's accent even reminds a bit of schwarzenegger's; this is not a plus. only lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassing herself, by playing the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way which befits a role in such a silly film. to describe these biblical characters as one-dimensional would be too give them undeserved credit; the characterization is half-dimensional.
