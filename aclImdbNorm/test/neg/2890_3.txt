i've been on a bad run of films. this is a clinker about an arson plot and a psychopath. tom skerrit, whom i really enjoy, was pretty young here. he is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over-insuring and burning. into the mix comes an agent, who is drowned, his daughter, and her nut-case boyfriend. james mason plays the insurance investigator. any idiot, given a little warning, would know something was rotten in the nation of australia. still, they bumble their way. the most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built, never got beyond being a bunch of sticks. low budget, i guess. the plot could have been interesting. maybe they should have hired a film editor (the did?). half the time you don't know where the characters are, but i guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory. it doesn't work. although there is lots of neat fire.
