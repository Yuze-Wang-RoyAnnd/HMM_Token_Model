another direct to video movie from disney, that is essentially perfect for the kids. the problem with kronk's new groove i find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and sombre film. in this movie, kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others' expenses. it takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film.<br /><br />kronk's new groove deals with two stories: yzma returns for payback and one ms. birdwell hopes to defeat kronk's camp counseling championship. this all leads up to kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his son's direction in life.<br /><br />from lord of the rings to michael jackson's thriller, kronk's new groove recycles every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers. if you loved the original, or are looking forward to the upcoming tv series about kuzco, i recommend kronk to his loyal fans.
