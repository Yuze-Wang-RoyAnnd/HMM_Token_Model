realty television crew are assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and hoody. lots of interviews where the members of the crew(and some of the locals who live in the town of white plains where most of this film is set)talk into the camera about each other, those they encounter in the town of white plains, their current situations, and the showbiz side of their lives. the screenplay is often acidic, cynical, and caustic and killer movie essentially pokes fun at realty television shows, featuring a cast of characters one might find on the real world. if this plot is attractive to you, knock yourself out. i found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat. out of the cast, paul wesley, the director needing a big break, encountering more than he could possibly bargain for, jake tanner, is a nice guy, coming off very likable and tolerant of the crap he must contend with, considering the prima donnas and immature people in his entourage who often cause nothing but migraines. particularly irksome is his producer lee(cyia batten), a tyrant constantly barking orders to everyone, her poisonous attitude creating much tension..she's the type of producer who wishes to capitalize on a small town eruption regarding the killer, using the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy occurring in white plains. those familiar with kaley cuoco know that by now she has perfected the pampered princess, got it down pat because it's the only role we ever see her in most of the time. as blanca, she's polarizing the way she demands attention, milking what little celeb status she has to the hilt, manufacturing much friction as she becomes a source of frustration, and has quite the potty mouth(cuoco may've taken the part just so she could escape her usual television sitcom roles, allowed to spout profanity without restriction) cuoco, along with the entire cast, services killer movie as eye candy, but it's hard to find any character you wouldn't want to see hacked to pieces with a meat cleaver. jason london is the sound/equipment guy, a real creep with a sour attitude, often tormenting the others with his foul comments that are uncalled for. we witness lots of personality clashes, watching how these self-absorbed hollywood types in the cast snipe at each other. the killer's identity shouldn't surprise anyone, it's quite blatantly obvious. some minor gore, but most of the violence is shot off-screen. despite some tame lesbianism, not even this is satisfying. leighton meester pops up in the film as a cute victim. director/writer jeff fisher assembles quite an attractive cast, but i wouldn't be able to distinguish this from the innumerable slashers that have stocked the horror shelves over the last ten or so years since scream. while i've never liked any of cuoco's characters, i never tire of looking at her, but eventually she needs to come up with a role that doesn't consist of her preening, with smug arrogance, always whining and complaining.
