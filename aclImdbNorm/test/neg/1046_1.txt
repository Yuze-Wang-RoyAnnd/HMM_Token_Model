"five characters in search of an exit" has to be one of the most boring "zones" ever made. it was on sci-fi this morning, and, as usual, i changed the channel. i put it in my top five list of the worst "zones" ever produced. dull and predictable, and not worth watching. serling worked this theme to death (earthlings in the hands of aliens, who often were giants), and in this particular version, it just doesn't work. anyone who hasn't seen it before, will quickly figure it out. this is another serling philosophical mood piece, perhaps paralleling the plight of those in prisoner of war or concentration camps, where the imprisoned may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captors. william windom, as the soldier who is the last to "drop in" is the only one curious to make the effort, and it doesn't take long to figure the outcome.
