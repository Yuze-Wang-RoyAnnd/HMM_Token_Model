here's what's good about "the slaughter rule:"<br /><br />--ryan gosling, clea duvall, and david morse all give great performances. gosling is, as always, pretty darn outstanding. the locales are often breathtaking.<br /><br />here's what's bad about "the slaughter rule:"<br /><br />--everything else. the script is horribly muddled. and while i can certainly appreciate a non-"feel good" movie, this movie is just boring. great performances can't make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make it sense. just getting through the first hour became a chore.<br /><br />i stuck with it because of gosling, but eventually i did myself a favor and changed the channel. spoilers on here relayed the ending to me. i didn't miss much. do yourself a favor--if you want a good gosling flick, check out "the believer."<br /><br />my score: 2 out of 10.
