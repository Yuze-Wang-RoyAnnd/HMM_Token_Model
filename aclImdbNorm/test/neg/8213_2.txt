buyer beware. the alpha video release uses a print that defies description. the movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. the print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. after 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. it looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception. adding to this travesty is the most plodding delivery of lines that i can recollect. even the voice over narration is stupor inducing. every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor. i found myself wishing that they would hurry and get the words out. for this reason i couldn't wait for this movie to end. it's one of those so-bad -it's- good movies but i wish that someone would find a half decent print.
