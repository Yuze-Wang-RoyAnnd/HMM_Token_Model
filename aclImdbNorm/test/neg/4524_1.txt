what a sad surprise.<br /><br />being a die-hard fan of the original series (starring don adams) i was really looking forward to this. poor fool me. this is sillier and more brain dead than a monkey's bottom.<br /><br />to say it was bad would be a severe understatement. it is/was the worst movie (well first 30 minutes of one) i have seen for a long time. i couldn't stand more than the first half hour, preferring to watch my hard drive de-fragment.<br /><br />i can tolerate bad... bad is o.k., sometimes even cute. but up with contrived hollywood crap (and this has to be the worst in many years) i will not put. this movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! my five year-old daughter could have written better - and she is not even dislexic!!! i'm really tempted to try watching the rest of it, but i'm afraid i have better things to do... like making pizza dough and watching it rise.<br /><br />what a sad disappointment. no... i'm buggered off! what a swindle! as mel brookes once said; "piece of shirt!"
