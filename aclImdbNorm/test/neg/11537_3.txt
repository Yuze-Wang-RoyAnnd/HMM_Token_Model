princess warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin plot-essentially on the death of their queen mother two sisters, one evil and one good, fight for control of the throne. the good sister is being beaten so she escapes to earth where she appears buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt contest. the rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene, as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister. but the younger sister is helped by bob, a good-hearted dj, and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister's ignorance of earth customs and culture. the older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again. throughout all of this action, there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age s'eance to bring the good sister back. sadly a good portion of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they drive around los angeles (and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed???) the film culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable ending.<br /><br />it seems to borrow elements from star wars (the light sabers and the look of the girls' home planet in the opening and subsequent scenes), dr. who (the phone booth like means of transportation) and some of the costumes (from the cult on the home planet) could have been taken from star trek episodes.<br /><br />ms. dana fredsti (the evil sister in the movie) in another user comment mentioned "the endless (and dull) wet t-shirt contest. it is seriously the longest wet t-shirt contest in cinema history. and the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cotton-polyester shirts that defied all efforts to get them wet and translucent." i couldn't state it any better. the only thing i would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoying.<br /><br />most of the acting is pretty over the top, but that seems to suit the whole style of the movie. the actors playing vinnie and vito were just too much for me-i just found them annoying. ms. fredsti (curette) seemed to be enjoying herself and not taking the whole thing too seriously, in contrast to sharon lee jones who acted decently but seemed to be taking everything more seriously. all of the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots, presumably to add comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary, given that the whole movie was rather comical.<br /><br />from a ratings perspective, this film had a lot of foul language; some topless women and others scantily clad in thongs, but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity; one sex scene that was portrayed in a non-graphic arty dreamlike fashion; and little violence-while there were threats of violence throughout, the scenes of both sword fighting and brawling were exaggerated, and too camp to be "offensive", though it looked like the actors were having a lot of fun with it.<br /><br />i have to wonder who came up with the character names? ovule (a small egg), curette (a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning), exzema (suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by scaling skin and pruritus), bulemia (an eating disorder with binging and purging) and rickettsia (another disease)? <br /><br />overall, this is a bad, low budget, campy, sci-fi action movie, but it did keep me entertained, though i might need a few drinks before watching it again.
