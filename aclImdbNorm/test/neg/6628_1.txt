carrot top's "chairman of the board" and his at&t commercials are living proof that fly-blown fecal matter is available in the color orange. not freely available, however, as hbo charges for such garbage. blehhh! the saving grace of cotb is that it surely fills suicide hot-lines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited, although (sadly) carrot top probably contributes to his sponsor at&t's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated hbo viewers. i can visualize the hordes of traumatized tv viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of last-minute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of cotb's orange-haired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.
