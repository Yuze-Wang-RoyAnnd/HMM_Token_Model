michael myers, the deranged, not-so-young-anymore psycho, who seems to get beefier with every appearance, is resurrected by his druid brothers to wreck more menace upon his family members, and any one else who gets in the way. gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. michael, who originally preferred strangulations and kitchen knives, learns to swing an axe and use whatever means necessary to off his victims, and the result is an awful, patchwork, dollar store film virtually unhelped by a few genuinely creepy sequences. donald pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have been injected into this story simply so *somebody* could be billed as the star. you won't want to cover your eyes during this one, but you will shake your head at the downward slide of john carpenter's classic creation.
