obviously, this one doesn't aim for the brain : the so-called "humour" is based on farting and every clich'e about any ethnic genre you can imagine, gays included of course, as long as they are not wasp. and a latino cowrote this ? besides, john leguizamo does have talent and charisma, but in such a self-indulgent movie it is a definite waste. what the point in trying to out-jim carrey jim carrey himself ? "the pest" of the title could then be this movie, almost as funny as bergman's finest. prepare to be annoyed, not amused
