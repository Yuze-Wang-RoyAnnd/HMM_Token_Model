this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. i have to admit that the whole audience i was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were greek or italian so i guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. god, and i can never get that 90 minutes back!
