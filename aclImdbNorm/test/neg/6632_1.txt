this should not have been made into a movie. everything about it was idiotic and i don't think i laughed even once. there were bits and pieces that were okay i guess but that's about it. a lot of parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which did them a hell of a lot better. there were some famous actors/actresses in this but no one did a good job, they must've just not cared. this is one of those movies that tries to have a "cute" ending but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values. carrot top is probably the worst comedian out there right now. do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one!<br /><br />final decisions:<br /><br />movies : nooooo!<br /><br />purchase dvd : absolutely not!<br /><br />rental : only if you've seen everything else and have a free coupon but even then it's still not worth your while.
