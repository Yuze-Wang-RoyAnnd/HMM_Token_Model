i'm a fan of judy garland, vincente minnelli, and gene kelly, but this movie just left me cold. i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli, so perhaps i was expecting too much.<br /><br />the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers. i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as mococo on the ship. i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown, too bad the song was so annoying. i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with bric-a-brac. check lorna luft's autobiography for some interesting information on that scene.<br /><br />actually, the movie has what must be some of cole porter's most annoying songs, especially "nina". also, judy and gene yell constantly like screechy children.<br /><br />the plot is thin--which is par for the course for musicals--but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs. i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor. please, some movie restorer, find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been!
