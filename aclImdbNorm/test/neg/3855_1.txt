ok, i'm normally pretty open minded about movies. i can normally see a good side to a film which has been totally pandered by others. this is an exception.<br /><br />i won't waste to much energy telling you what happens, but think along the lines of bill and ted meets the worst police academy movie out of all of them and you won't be far off.<br /><br />the thing that really got me about this film was the stupid purile racism that was evident throughout. the general theme of latino/black guys = cool, white guys = lame is slightly amusing for the first couple of jokes but when the same joke has been reiterated for the 500th time (not an exageration by the way) it gets both tiresome and offensive.<br /><br />i spent months waiting for the laws of karma to get back at john leguizamo for this film. i had almost given up hope when the 'my vh1 awards' were screened live in the uk. what followed was mr leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage. you'd have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him. ahem. ha! ha! ha!
