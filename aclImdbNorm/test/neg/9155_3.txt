great book, poorly done movie. cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the after school special category. no doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong the very talented gretchen mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. feels like everyone just phoned it in. even the makeup (mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude. don't waste your time on this clunker.... go read the book.
