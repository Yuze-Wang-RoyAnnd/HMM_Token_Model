i'll say it again... one of the worst films ever made and it was made by the director that made one of my most, favorite films - "excalibur". i was floored to see it got a grade of over six. this movie sucks. it looked terrible. it looked like it was shot in 18 days and boorman must've been sleeping when he directed this. arquette didn't do anything. just plain terrible, rotten, unbearable and probably the only blemish in boorman's celebrated career.<br /><br />1/10!!!!!
