even though i have great interest in biblical movies, i was bored to death every minute of the movie. everything is bad. the movie is too long, the acting is most of the time a joke and the script is horrible. i did not get the point in mixing the story about abraham and noah together. so if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror.
