i love movies in this genre. beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity. so why didn't i like this movie? no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. who's who, where is the money, it's not se7en, just make me laugh. maybe it's me, but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national lampoon's movies. this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling, waiting for what's next. instead, i find myself stopping to think, "why did they keep that scene?" i do not recommend this movie. if you are expecting van wilder, think again. the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generously.
