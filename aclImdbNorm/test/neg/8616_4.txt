an in-name-only sequel to john carpenter's vampires, this movie takes place in thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires, who enjoy killing people, and a sect of good vampires who do not. while it's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in thailand, the writers don't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale. this film could just as easily have been set in los angeles. which brings me to my next point, which is that this seems a lot like blade lite. we've got the rock soundtrack, the martial art battle scenes, a dance club bloodletting and, of course, lots of sharp objects going through vampires. what we don't have is the budget and talent. yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad his acting wasn't as good, and there's plenty of decent wire work, and tons of revved up fight sequences, maybe too many. the problem is they just don't have the same impact as the ones in any of the blade films. perhaps it's just that the film has a "been there seen that" feel to it.<br /><br />however, for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead, played by the buff and bland colin egglesfield, and his girlfriend. she gets snatched at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. we have no vested interest in her welfare at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot.<br /><br />in the end, you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this, but i can think of a lot better things to do with your time, like renting any of the blade movies.
