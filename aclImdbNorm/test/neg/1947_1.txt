this is really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. furthermore, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced. nothing happens in this film, you would expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. the plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger that they pick up from the high way. the couple invite the stranger to stay with them, because he is homeless. at this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right? no they just kiss and thats it. also, this film contains no action, no comedy, no drama, and not even suspense. makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script!!!!
