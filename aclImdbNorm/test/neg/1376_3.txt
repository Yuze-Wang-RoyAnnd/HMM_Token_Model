i've only seen most of the series since i leave the tv on as background noise in my dorm.<br /><br />i've been a fan of mencia but this show really doesn't do much for me. occasionally he'll say or do something to pull a chuckle out, but he has this aura of smugness that completely ruins it.<br /><br />i've always thought he was funny because of his raging angry-man routine that's not terribly prevalent in this tv series. instead, he's just smug. i guess that just reflects how funny his comedy is: stale and uninteresting when he isn't in the proper mode of delivery. i've seen him get into it sometimes on his show, but for the most part, he just sits there smiling and looking smug, and it doesn't suit him well.<br /><br />just my opinion though.
