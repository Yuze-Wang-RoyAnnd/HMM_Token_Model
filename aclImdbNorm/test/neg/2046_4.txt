the thing that's truly terrifying about this is that the filmmakers thought they were making something intelligent and sexy. instead they made probably the stupidest horror picture of the year!<br /><br />this movie starts with a bunch of art snob friends at a gallery. this trashy european weirdo walks up and starts talking pretentious fruitiness to the main character, sounding like he just walked out of an episode of dark shadows. he then offers her up some stick to smoke(yes, a freakin' stick), which she eagerly agrees! he picks off some red crap and puts it in a spoon for her to freebase! if this ever happens to you in real life, don't do it!<br /><br />she's transported to some weird wannabe jean rollin netherworld that's supposed to be sexy but isn't, where there's this thing that looks like a rotted creature from the black lagoon!<br /><br />soon she turns all her artsy sleazeball friends onto her new form of supernatural crack. no matter how much these idiots freak out and turn blue they can't leave it the hell alone. at one point she even makes out with the rotten creature!<br /><br />after the final battle and the stupid woman is vaporized or whatever, the so called hero is left alone to pack up his copy of michael moore's dude where's my country and can't resist smoking that stick one more time to try to rescue his moron lady friend. what a dope.<br /><br />rates four stars for sheer unintentional humor.
