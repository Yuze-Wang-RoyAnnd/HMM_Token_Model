this film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites. castle freak himself is a good monster. i would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me. however, the movie had some dumb parts about it.<br /><br />a husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. i suppose death is a greater damage than blindness, but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind. all they care about is that "j.j.'s dead!" while their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how she'll never be able to drive a car. the parents are like - "honey, stop walking around without a guide, you know better than that," and then they cry and don't ever stop being depressed because jj's dead. sounds like favortism to me.<br /><br /> the lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done. for example, when a giant crash is heard in the castle, everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was. it was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered. the husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and plainly says, "the mirror broke." i don't know, i would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle.<br /><br /> the husband and wife have some major relationship problems and it's funny to watch how dumb they are with each other. no one ever believes the blind girl. advice: if a blind girl says she hears things, believe her and don't tell her to shut up. i think this is the moral of the story. listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your point.<br /><br /> lastly, i thought the best character was the main police officer. he was the best actor and character. everyone else (besides castle freak) was pretty run of the mill. 3/10
