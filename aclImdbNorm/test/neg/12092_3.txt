first, what is really great about this movie: <br /><br />- ryan reynolds, great acting! there are very few actors i really like and for now he is one of them. he has an amazing skill to impersonate characters. <br /><br />- the soundtrack! very good music played at the right time. <br /><br />- the idea of a nine lost in his own world, incapable of leaving. <br /><br />still, i give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: <br /><br />- horrible second part. it seems that the director was very eager to make something new, but despite of the efforts it was really boring <br /><br />- very annoying character melissa. i couldn't stand the scenes with her - i.e. it was constantly annoying. she represents everything that is wrong with american woman. <br /><br />- terrible explanation of the numbers. the director was so busy with character development, that he completely missed the point of a good story.. excuse me koalas? brr... terrible!<br /><br />this movie had great potential. the filming is nicely done, the music is really good, but nothing more.<br /><br />see it only if you are a fan of ryan reynolds, or have a lot of time to spare.
