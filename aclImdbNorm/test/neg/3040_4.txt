simon west's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school thrills to a contemporary audience. starring talented teen camilla belle, when a stanger calls fails to even elicit a shocked, or even surprised face. poor attempts at scaring the audience range from blurred coats that look like people to building the tense music up for a cat running out of the shadows. the plot follows jill johnson (belle), a teenage girl that has to pay off a bill to her father via babysitting. she is invited to work for the night at a house by the river, and thinks it a perfectly easy way to make cash. but little does she know, a stranger lurks in the house, and constantly harasses johnson via the phone. a pathetic excuse for a film.
