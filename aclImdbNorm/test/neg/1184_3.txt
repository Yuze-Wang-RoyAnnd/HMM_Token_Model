i just don't get these reviews! i can't help thinking they are written by the sort of l.o.g fan who would worship anything they ever do without questioning whether it is actually any good.<br /><br />i'm a massive fan of the programme but thought this film was a pointless project. i could forgive the ridiculous plot if i had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice. at one point, i thought it might just me before i realised hardly any laughs were minting from the rest of audience.<br /><br />i wasn't expecting much of a plot (very few tv comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes) but thought the odd bit of classic l.o.g dialogue or visual joke (like at the start of each programme) would carry a film. after 5 minutes of the 17th century plot, i was begging for it to end (little did i know it would carry on for the rest of the film). it just wasn't funny.<br /><br />i was just massively disappointed and can't see history being too kind to it, even if a few die-hard fans write enthusiastic reviews.
