it is such a shame when actors and actresses of high quality get involved with pure crap, probably because they were offered a great deal of money. not one of helen mirren's better career moves. the acting of the "teens" is simply appalling, not helped by a script that is in parts simply inept.<br /><br />most of kevin williamson's work is above average box office dross, but this is really below par. <br /><br />this is the sort of movie that you watch on tv when there is nothing better on and you have had half a bottle of wine to drink and are waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half.
