i'm starting to wonder, after reading some of the opinions here, if i watched the same film as the other reviewers but after checking my facts i am forced to the sad conclusion that i have.<br /><br />this witless wannabee screwball comedy has to be one of the the longest 94 minutes i have spent, and one of the most unfunny things i have seen, for ages. now don't get me wrong, i love screwball comedies, but this boring, set-bound drivel falls so far short of the dizzy heights of preston sturges and howards hawks that it doesn't deserve (to mix my metaphors) to be thought of in the same breath as those greats. writer / director charles martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle or interesting - and there's so much of it. he doesn't know how to end a scene either, with some ruthless cutting, especially of people exiting rooms and saying goodbye to each other, the pace of film would have been lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters are doing stupid and motiveless things for no other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious. characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other, and move in and out of apartments, at a moment's notice only to move what little plot there is forward. one moment people are desperately yearning for one person, the next they are getting married to someone else - having wooed and been wooed off screen so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us - "oh, they're getting married!" (usually after someone has made a faux-pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion). if we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before hand we, the audience, might have enjoyed the experience of watching someone making a fool of themselves in front of them. as it is the characters just come over looking like selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them.<br /><br />the sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play. the only moments of relief from the tedium are keenan wynn who looks like he has wandered in from a different movie and has decided to hang around and be slightly funnier than all the unfunny stuff going on around him.<br /><br />highly avoidable.
