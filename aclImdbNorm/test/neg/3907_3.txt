how do stories this bad get made. that's not a question. it is a statement.<br /><br />here are my problems with the film.<br /><br />1) much of the story development was predictable and boring. my emotions ran pretty much in a flat line throughout. there wasn't really much to draw the viewer into the film.<br /><br />2) the characters were decidedly uncharismatic. one was a loon, another was confusing, and the third was pretty damned boring. there was absolutely zero reason to be drawn to these people. even though i knew it wouldn't happen, i kept hoping that they would run into someone else, someone more interesting.<br /><br />3) the physical environment was uncomfortable for me. a trailer??? in the desert??? the desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit. how is it that these three people end up in the desert???<br /><br />4) and in the same desert. did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth would manage to find each other within the span of a few weeks out in that desert?<br /><br />5) was it really necessary for ms. ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit? hey, she looks great, but it was pretty gratuitous.<br /><br />okay, so if i thought it was so bad, why did i give it a 3? i am trying to be as objective as possible. even though i found alan annoying, i have to say that david arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of a few of albert brooks more annoying roles). jeri ryan tried to do something with sarah, but it just wasn't written very well. okay, so she was supposed to be a confused, dysfunctional woman. but why? what did it add to the story? her mood swings left me feeling like i was being jerked (hard!) one way and then another and then another.<br /><br />i don't often walk out on films, but this one had me contemplating it several times. stiff, predictable, boring. proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />my 2 cents.
