this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seen.<br /><br />i can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a sf one.<br /><br />for example: <br /><br />1. it is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly.<br /><br />2. you can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie.(believe me, it's my domain)<br /><br />3. with a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy. let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron.<br /><br />4. if you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint (in the best case, it's more likely to die because your hart fails) before to get to the bone(shin).<br /><br />and there are more other examples.
