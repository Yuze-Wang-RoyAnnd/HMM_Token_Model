this movie was on the pay channels today and i had nothing to do so i had it on. this has to be the worst football movie ever made. this has to be one of the worst movies period. the premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. this movie isn't even a half a star. bad acting, scott bakula sinks as usual, larry miller?? sinbad, couldn't act if he tried. rob schneider's one liners completely stunk. fred thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. the only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see kathy ireland nude in the shower, not even close. a complete waste of time and of film. if we could give a negative number, minus 9.
