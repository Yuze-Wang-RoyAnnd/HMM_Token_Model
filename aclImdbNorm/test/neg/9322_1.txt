don't get me wrong, i love most of paul schrader's movies, so it was with sheer excitement i was able to attend at the "rolling thunder" screening at the parisian french cinemath`eque with surprise movie on the 17th dec 2004. of course the surprise movie was the exorcist and most people were there for that (i was too). the film was then finished but the score, so p schrader used excerpts from the return of the king and some other movie i forget (was it conan?). anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized. the happy few there (maybe 200 people) were told to please not write about the film on the internet or magazines since it may have jeopardized its chance of getting selected to the cannes film festival. then came the film, then came the realization that the film might not get selected for the festival because of its quality : never in my life had i experienced such a feeling of awkwardness in the audience as people went from being skeptical to plainly laughing out loud at the pity-full spectacle. i couldn't believe how low the author of light sleeper, mishima, blue collar and affliction had sunk.<br /><br />forced over-the-top acting thorough, stupid ending, black and white moral, awful fxs, worst take on christianity from schrader ever, not even suspenseful, just boring as hell (no pun intended) and unsurprising at all! some good locations but sadly miss-used or at least not fulfilling the initial hopes! in the end i was 100 times more satisfied by the schrader penned rolling thunder and wished my 2 hours back.<br /><br />don't believe the hype, even the john boorman movie is more exciting and original. oh, and the billy crawford casting, the poor guy does his best, but what where you expecting? he's now part of the small club of worst casting mistakes ever! i give the movie a 1/5 just because i didn't leave the room, but i should have.
