it's difficult to decide whether this movie suffers from crap dialogue or if it's just made to appear so by crap actors. in any case it suffers from storywriting which is mediocre at best.<br /><br />although made in the late '80's, the first part of the movie plays like a 60's teenage screwball comedy (barring the absence of any actual humour), especially the part of the 'good girl', which is as annoying a doris day figure as you could hope/fear for, including the slightly whiny opposition to anything 'fun' her friends want to do. the net effect is, after a while you start to hope she'll bite it so you don't have to listen to her voice anymore.<br /><br />some profanity and gratuitous nudity, plus some really 80's style clothing is your only clue that this movie was made in the 80's. oh, and some pretty passable music, too.<br /><br />storywise, it's pretty formulaic stuff. a bunch of horny (apart, obviously , from 'miss nice girl') teenagers decide to celebrate halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house. partying and fornication ensues, along with an ill-advised 'seance' which kicks off the demonic possession spree which is the subject of the movie. after this, the only suspenseful part will be trying to guess in which order the characters will expire. you're sure not to care whether or not they will. the actors are so bad that becoming demons/zombies/dinner actually improves their performance somewhat, and the ridiculously clich'e dialogue is so annoying that you squirm in your seat.<br /><br />gorewise, this flick ain't nuthin' special, unless you think cheesy is kind of 'special'. for example, the demon head which occasionally appears is so screamingly fake that you wonder if it's a 5-year old trick-or-treating.<br /><br />this is not to say there's nothing enjoyable in the flick. some of the music isn't half bad, and the first of our insipid scooby gang to get possessed performs a marvelous and really sexy dance routine at one point, before she turns nasty.<br /><br />also, and i don't know why, towards the very end of the flick, i actually managed to get somewhat involved. the suspense lacking in most of the movie made a late appearance, and i started to squirm out of unease instead of annoyance. which is what a horror movie is supposed to do.<br /><br />concequently, i cannot bring myself to give this movie a rock-bottom rating, since by some inexplicable miracle (i don't rule out being possessed by demons) i was actually a little creeped.<br /><br />don't pay money to see it, though. it's hardly worth your time, yet alone hard cash. watch it on youtube while it's there.
