sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. it was very very rushed, as i suppose you can understand a movie length version of pride & prejudice would be and i felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. as the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. <br /><br />not only that, this movie is boring. i say that with a capital b. 1/3 of the way through i started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. as i have read the book and watch the bbc version, i knew how many scenes had to go, before i could finally leave the cinema. mr darcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. he looks also too young to play mr darcy. every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something. where is the build up? at first, he seems confused with everything. he is just bizarre! it all looks put on. <br /><br />was trying not to compare to the colin firth version but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.<br /><br />the costumes are absolutely shocking. where are the corsets? i know elizabeth is poor, but i think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of england.<br /><br />i didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that i don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things, honestly mr bingley who has wealth should know better. there is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in, and not at all like jane austen. bingley's character is shockingly donee, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. what about that laugh of his!!! i wickham hardly has a presence and mr & mrs hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. keira did okay, but it just ain't the same.
