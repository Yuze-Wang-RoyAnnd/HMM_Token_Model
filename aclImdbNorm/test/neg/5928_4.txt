sometimes i think that somewhere in the "lifetime" channel's office complex there is a room where the writer's hang-out, with a large wheel on the wall - sort of like the big six ones in casinos. the latter have a lot of spots where you win even money, and fewer for higher amounts, until there are perhaps a couple which pay bigger bucks.<br /><br />but i picture the channel's wheel having about six different genres on its wheel, with two of them, appearing the most, labeled "the psychotic neighbor," or "the spouse with a hidden past or secret or both." "lifetime" movies have a few repetitive story lines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous.<br /><br />the "spouse..." category can have a spouse of long-standing, but some person appears, or an event occurs, exposing that the good wife was once a hooker, one of the couple was involved in some nefarious act long ago, or that something else in one of the background in different than presumed -- etc., etc., or, as in this flick, one of them has entered the marriage with the most nefarious of aims.<br /><br />one constant, in all of their genres is that the husband or other males are usually clueless, vacuous, and slow to have any idea what in the hell is going until the climax, or at best, very late in the proceedings (unless the male is the miscreant). not the case here.<br /><br />whether the referenced miscreant might be the "neighbor," or as in this offering, "the wife," it is always fascinating how easily, successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their dastardly deeds. they manipulate many of the others, whack them as necessary, assume various poses, and juggle more deceptions than you can count - with unfailing success until just before the end.<br /><br />the lead actor here, like many in this channel's movies, is an old hand. i noticed that another film in which he starred was titled "the perfect neighbor."<br /><br />finally, the vengeful "perfect wife" in this flick dispatches those in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent "button man" in don corleone's family could muster. and i couldn't help but imagine that jack nocholson's melvin udall character fro "as good as it gets," with his massive ocd affliction, could provide counsel to the anti-heroine to assist in dealing with he obsession which was the basis of this opus.
