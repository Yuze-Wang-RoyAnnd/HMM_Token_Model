eh. this is a popcorn movie, nothing more. i watched this with a bunch of friends (and though that might not be the best way to view a horror movie...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable.<br /><br />it left me yearning for a real film. :)<br /><br />the main problem is the lack of tension in the film. it keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes, which dissipates any discernible tension.<br /><br />and the character relationship 'twists'? yeah, they suck. i won't say what they are, but they just don't add anything to the film/storyline.<br /><br />(by relationship, i mean the two main characters.)<br /><br />eek. my recommendation is this: watch this movie if you can't think of anything better. mediocre at best...maybe not even that.
