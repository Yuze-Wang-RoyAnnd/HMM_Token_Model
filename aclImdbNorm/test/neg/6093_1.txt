if you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the "villain" not be more sympathetic than the "victim". and this fails miserably. it was so terrible and frustrating to watch that i was actually moved to register and comment. ok, so the husband is rich and cocky. there are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife display plenty. the husband is a jerk because he - um, didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman - the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot btw. the cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife. he then forces himself on her - which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him. uh huh. the misogynistic, inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting. it is one thing when a fine film like american psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in survival island i felt like i was watching a movie about ted bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims. what was he thinking???
