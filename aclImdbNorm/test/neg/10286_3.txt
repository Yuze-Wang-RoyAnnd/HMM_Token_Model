if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy surveillance. this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. the notion that this is a "thriller" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. you kept waiting for the story to actually finish "starting". it never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. picture all of the violence of "no country for old men" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters. thrill-killers run amok. the acting is good, mostly, but the script is a pile. don't bother, and tell your friends to don't bother.
