although a well produced made for television movie, dying to love you reeks with low grade melodramatic splendor.<br /><br />the film opens up to roger paulson (tim matheson, looking much older than i remember him to be), who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty, lonely life after his wife ruthie (who looks suspiciously like roseanne arnold) leaves him with the quickness. now all roger has is his cats....and his ad in the newspaper. <br /><br />once his ad is answered, he calls johnnie-elaine-lisa-oh it doesn't matter i'm whoever you want me to be-lawrence. then...they have phone sex.<br /><br />i'm not sure where you're from or when you were born, but i remember that phone-sex bit was played out by the late '80's. i'm sorry but that was trashy.<br /><br />soon roger and the broad hook up and have a whirlwind romance. they fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then have some kinky sex with roger's son in the other room. she ties him to the bed and seduces him.<br /><br />roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that johnnie-eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around. god forbid women only sleep with one man. soon enough, strange phone calls begin to occur, johnny girl wants roger to marry her with absolute quickness, and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her. it's funny to see roger believe her through all this stuff. that's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife. he takes her crappy advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase crawling with fake id cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow. he immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested. even though all this jazz, he still loves the dumb broad. she tells so much lies, it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once.<br /><br />roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named angela who looks like something off of gremlins 2. she has a child as well and roger takes quite a liking to her. but something inside roger's subconscious keeps him connected to lisa rohn (if that's even her real name) and he keeps going back to see her.<br /><br />now lisa is the "ex that won't go away" as she "earns" herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at roger's doorstep and his son matt is so busy trying to check her out, he pours juice all over the floor. il' rog is so stupid, he throws lisa out and doesn't even change the locks. boy, if all people were that stupid, i wouldn't even be writing this review. the ending of this movie is so corny, you won't believe.<br /><br />tim matheson is a made-for-tv-movie king. he just looks like such a dawm mummy in this movie. he's a little wooden and stiff. the dazzling tracy pollan works well with her role and her trampiness rings true. she is extremely beautiful and i do see what michael j. fox sees in her. <br /><br />this movie is great to watch when you're on that late night tip, but then again, you might fall asleep, considering how dull and bland it is.
