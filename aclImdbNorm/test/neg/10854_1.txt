well, i have been to a british university, in fact i went to the one in this very film, and it was nothing like that. this is a horrible, badly made and acted film. worst thing is, it could have been really good, if they bothered to spend more that 12p on it, in fact if it really wanted to represent true british students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound loan. it says nothing about uni life, where was the bush diving, the tea drinking till 4am, the endless chats about group dynamics??? where was the diversity and fun? maybe i'm just being romantic, but i don't remember fresher's week being that awful, and i'm teetotal. and in the end the question still remains...a bed or a wardrobe?
