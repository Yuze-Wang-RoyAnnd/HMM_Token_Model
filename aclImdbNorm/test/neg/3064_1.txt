as a michigander, i got the michigan jokes. very funny - make fun of pontiac, ann arbor, all those lame suburbs of detroit. yes, yes, i've heard these jokes a million times. i'll give them credit for accurately depicting the lameness of grosse pointe. it couldn't get more white. did you hear those lovely michigan nasal accents? where the girls talk so fast you can't understand one word that comes out of their mouth (nose)...? as much as i love michigan, i hated this movie. <br /><br />i have never met one person from grosse pointe that i liked. listen to that awful live band and that annoying and horrid background music! what is that? one of your gross pointe homeboy's band? probably. wow, what a great "detroit scene" you guys have over there. funny how people from grosse pointe always say they're from detroit. they're so white and rich, they wish they had something to complain about.<br /><br />anyway, this movie blows. all the way from the lame jokes about girls in thongs to the terrible character development. oh wait a minute, you mean the entire basis for a character is that he says the f-word a lot? what a deep personality. great job, grosse pointers! and i love all the sexist lingo, like how the narrator calls the first girl who gets killed that we never even hear speak a "naive b*tch". that's really lovely.<br /><br />and those homemade masks with the marilyn manson contact lenses are really great. and i love how it made perfect sense as to why the bikers came by and killed people. and how their narrating master had such a obvious role in the movie... ?? the main boyfriend dude was so boring i fell asleep looking at him. the three idiot guys (or was it two or four? how can i tell, they all look and act the same!) were so desperately trying to make me laugh, but beavis and butthead already got out my butt humor laughs back in 1994. and what's with the gay jokes? no wonder this movie sucked - everyone involved must have some minor problems with their masculinity, eh boys?<br /><br />the only saving grace to this film was the main girl. despite what the other people on here have said, she actually was a good actress. teenage girls talk the way she talked. they really act the way she acted. her acting was very natural and believable. i really thought she was a grosse pointe convenience store employee. .. maybe she is! and yeah she had big boobs, most the women here do. michigan is the fattest state in the union, you know. in all aspects.<br /><br />so, those of you who think this is a representation of detroit, it's not. it's the suburbs of detroit. they are very white and full of aimless teen angst. limp bizkut, icp (yes, icp is from one of our suburbs) and $75 baggy khaki pants all the way! lame rich kids who are mad because they have lots of money and nothing to complain about. and they make bad movies, too.<br /><br />
