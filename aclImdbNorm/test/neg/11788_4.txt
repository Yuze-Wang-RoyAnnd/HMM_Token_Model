it's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. it certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all-star cast. these days it's shown much too frequently on fox movie channel or amc.<br /><br />it pains me to report that veteran actors like walter pigeon and joan fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty, none of which rings true. it's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog. it's a comic book version of the jules verne novel.<br /><br />the maturing fontaine was still attractive but wears a pained expression on her face, perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script. she contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time. faring no better are robert sterling, barbara eden and--most of all, peter lorre--as well as frankie avalon, who gets to sing the title tune which--it's safe to say--did not become anyone's favorite title tune.<br /><br />an awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence. totally unconvincing from start to finish. the film, as well as the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a dreary conclusion.
