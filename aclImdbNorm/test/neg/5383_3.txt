i enjoy films of various kinds and qualities. whether it's your typical standard hollywood action movie or your oscar season tear-jerker, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be enjoyable for me.<br /><br />in soap girl, i received nothing but confusion. first, we meet maya, a massage parlor worker who seems to attract all the customers in the parlor. a virgin poet named harry comes in one day and they fall in love. after that, there are various twists and turns thrown into the plot which seem to lead nowhere.<br /><br />although many have commented on the controversial issue of an asian prostitute being exploited by the white man, keep in mind that this film was made by an asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue. but whether he succeeds or not does not matter, for the issue at hand is whether the movie is enjoyable or not.<br /><br />for me, soap girl fails to meet the standard i expect from movies. it was hard for me to get involved emotionally with this movie, given the loose plot and the mediocre acting. worse, it seems as if the director wanted to make a drama, when the tone falls more towards comedy.<br /><br />a movie such as soap girl which fails to trap me into the magic of cinema will always leave me bored. throughout the movie, i couldn't help but think, "what is this really about?" a movie has to answer that question before it is made. if not, what you'll end up with is an empty push to captivate the audience.<br /><br />grade: d+<br /><br />
