do not watch this movie, go see something else ... i was very disappointed, i cannot rate this movie any better than 3. the acting was quite good and i really liked william dafoe as the villain, but i cannot see why this movie made it to the big screen. the story was old and has been shown in 100+ other movies and 1000+ tv series/movies. the main problem was basically: nothing is happening. take a kidnapping, let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man deliver the money, make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to 95 minutes, you got your "clearing" movie. the only 2 reasons i did not rate this a 1 was a) dafoe and b) the "plan-b-ending". there are not many endings you can give a kidnapper movie ... 75% of these kind end with ending a, 20% end ending b and 1% ends with something unforeseeable. boring, boring, boring.
