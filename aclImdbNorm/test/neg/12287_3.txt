this may be all you need to know in order to decide whether you want to see this.<br /><br />the movie is bad. really, really bad. and sometimes it seems to be aware of that and make fun of how bad it is. it aligns cliche after cliche and even manages to grow worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be hilariously funny.<br /><br />if you can laugh about really poor quality in script writing and production values, you might enjoy it. otherwise prepare for some serious brain damage.<br /><br />3/10
