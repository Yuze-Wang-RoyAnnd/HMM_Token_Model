this could have been a good tv-movie, but the flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie. as they give the viewer informations on the way (will the movie proceeds) i found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned that in the beginning. then the whole trail would probably not have been necessary.<br /><br />when the movie ends you understand why she shot, and of course she is not guilty. too bad that the producer/director used the flashbacks this way, but on the other had the movie would not have been worth while at all.<br /><br />nice movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill the evening.
