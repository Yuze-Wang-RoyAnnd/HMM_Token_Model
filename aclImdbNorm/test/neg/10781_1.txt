sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. this is one of those films. of course i can't help that i'm biased. i'm from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i don't find billy crystal funny at all. and i can't stand all that english style photography(tony scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. i suppose we're supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a cubs jersey. oh and the plot. if you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad guys, since they're more dangerous. and of course there's the clich'e of the cops on the verge of retiring. but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson center(a state building!) of course it's a cool building, but it's the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house.
