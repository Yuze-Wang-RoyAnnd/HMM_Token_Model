since wesley snipes descended(or ascended)to the world of dtv action movies the result has been miss,so-so,and miss.unstoppible was weak.7 seconds was entertaining.the marksman was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank.<br /><br />and what of the detonator?we'll anything would be above suffering the marksman again.but the detonator holds a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and low budget.<br /><br />sonny griffith is a not-so-by-the-book covert op who busts illegal arms dealers in poland.when his latest assignment ends up a bullet-buffet leaving a pile of bodies;sonny then is ordered to escort a witness; nadia (the ever-hot silvia colloca) to the us.trouble is; sonny is being duped by a traitor in his own organization who is keeping his trail hot for gangsters with nuclier ambitions.<br /><br />snipes delivers in the action department.he is in half-blade mode here.he actually does well in the first 15 minutes of the detonator,before descending into pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the marksman.colloca does more than look pretty.there is some conviction to her scenes.a lot of the actors look familiar,and have been in the last 3 or 4 seagal/snipes movies.its always good to see michael brandon again.<br /><br />the action is telegraphed here.but never boring.running,car chases,fights.director po-chih leong seems to have gotten better after the seagal farce;out of reach.he does a credible job.but is constantly hampered by the low budget.enough with the eastern euro-locations.its cheapening the movie's look.vancover cannot be that much expensive can it?<br /><br />the detonator ends just average.it does not have the so-bad its fun aspect of seagal' mercenary for justice. but it is nowhere near as entertaining as van damme's second in command.nor as thrilling as dolph's mechanik.perhaps dolph should direct wesley next eh?<br /><br />its high time the producers pump a little more money and thought into these dtv titles with the kind of money they are making from them.its only fair.the result could be a high seller perhaps?<br /><br />snipes would be advised to try making this one his last dtv action flick.its sad to see yet another waste of this gifted actor's talents.
