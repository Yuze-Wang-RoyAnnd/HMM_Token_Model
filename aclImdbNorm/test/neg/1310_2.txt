i really do not joke when i can honestly submit that this film is not suitable for sunday night viewing on itv4.<br /><br />the underground scenes are just awful when london is supposedly under 30ft of water, robert carlyles character is drab. the police commissioners outfit reminds me of something kate moss threw up and nigel planer looks very very old, in fact, i am worried that he may have had suffered a stroke whilst filming.<br /><br />the father of robert carlyle who was 'right all along' has obviously been necking too many ketamin and whilst he has a major part in this awkward journey, he deserved to be killed off way way before he was caught pretending to be kate winslett (titanic) whilst dangling over the thames barrier.<br /><br />i'm sorry film lovers but avoid at all costs.
