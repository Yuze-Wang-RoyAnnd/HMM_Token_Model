i'll start by confessing that i tend to really enjoy action movies (military or other). i'm a guy. but this dreck was awful. i saw it for free, showtime or hbo and still feel i paid too much. it was a prolonged episode of general hospital. <br /><br />i gave it a 1, only because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. how or why 59 others would give it a rating of between 5 and 6 boggles my mind. unless they are all family of the cast or crew. <br /><br />it might be, this movie was so bad many bailed out.......and as such, were too uninvested to bother.<br /><br />i'm sorry for repeating but the 10 line minimum seems silly, for what essentially boils down to a warning.........in hopes of saving others the 2 hr black hole, this movie represents. trust me, stare at a blank wall, they'll be more action.
