i know if i was a low budget film maker i would probably be checking this page to find out what people are saying about it. so i really hope the creators of the movie actually read this! i think you should find a way to repay me for the hour and a half of life i just wasted watching this garbage. please stop making movies about something you probably fantasize about. just stop making movies all together...you are one of the reasons it is so hard for indie filmmakers to make it big. do the world a favor and get a job a mcdonalds or something so you can do something productive with your life! i feel like calling blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this film in their store.
