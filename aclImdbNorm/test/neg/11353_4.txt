"marar'ia" really disappointed me. i can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. dr. ferm'in displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. i mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with marar'ia?? maybe once? also, marar'ia never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?). some of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story, that of marcial, the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard. of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the canary islands, and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the movie fell short of a documentary (in case this was its real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama.
