an ear-splitting movie, a quasi-old-fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star madonna's comedic attributes. she does indeed go far out on the proverbial limb here playing a beyond-vivacious parolee attempting to prove she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she ran a red light...big laughs). after an energetic animated credits sequence--which is much more fun than the rest of the picture--we have nothing to look at but madonna's black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion. what else is there? griffin dunne seems defeated playing maddy's keeper, while the poor-choice supporting cast struggles to get laughs with lousy dialogue. it's an unfortunate set-back to the talents of director james foley, who unwisely allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick films from the 1930s (but even katharine hepburn in "bringing up baby" had a human side). wretched. * from ****
