this movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went. when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie. the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. there was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie. it wasn't. in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. beside each one are two attractive women. the men begin asking "do you hear that" or "do you see them". we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. the women do not see these creatures. this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour. it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called "plot" of the film. we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists. what is this about? we never find out. the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do
