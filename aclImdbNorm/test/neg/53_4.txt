i don't get it! the teenage leads in "horror star" supposedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol (conrad radzoff) passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it. that doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it? i'm a big horror fan and i immensely idolize departed icons like vincent price, peter cushing and boris karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory. no wonder conrad comes back from the dead
