it didn't take too long after halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continuous mediocrity. as early as 1983 the genre was already struggling to release more than three decent offerings per year and by '88 the stalk and slash flick had become pretty much the whipping boy of horror cinema. by that time major studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, which left it up to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that john carpenter had created. although there was still an impressive number of features hitting shelves in 88, most of them were weakly produced and taken as a whole they were eminently unappealing. with that said there were a couple of gems amongst the rubble. scott spiegel's intruder in its uncut form was a superb gross out classic, whilst evil dead trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely run out of style and panache. william lustig's maniac cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later dead girls and mirage proved to be the last beguiling breaths of life in the ailing category.<br /><br />it was the continual release of schlock like berserker, blood lake and rush week that cursed the slasher movie to eight years of obscurity. it finally took the big budgeted flamboyance of wes craven's scream to provide the necessary resuscitation. having not heard anything about demon warrior before i came across it unexpectedly, i instantly assumed that it was part of the low brow trash that led to the downfall of the slasher phase. but with that said the movie boasts an intriguing premise that sits comfortably beside scalps and camping del terrore as another welcome addition to the native-american influenced catalogue.<br /><br />a truck pulls up on a woodland road and out step two laughably dramatised rednecks. the hillbilly lumberjacks are only on screen for around for ten seconds and then they are murdered by an unseen menace. next we meet a troupe of five young adults that are heading to the same location for a spot of shotgun-target-practice on some of the local wildlife. the area is owned by neil willard and has been passed down through three generations of his family. his grandfather stole the land from an indian medicine man that was rumoured to have left a curse on the property. according to legend, every ten years a demon warrior with an extreme hatred for mankind stalks the forest reaping revenge on those he deems responsible for the pilfering of the tribe's home. it wouldn't be much fun if those myths were a falsehood, so regular as clockwork a maniacal assassin turns up with a taste for blood. will the kids be able to stop this phantom killer
