i must say i was surprised to find several positive comments to this turkey (in desperate need of a feather transplant)! i'm giving it a 1 because i think the idea of making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - jerry lee lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to put out such trash and the "killer" does not deserve this! it's a good thing it came late in his career... they said elvis practically ruined his career with the movies he put out through the sixties and this could have done the same for jerry lee, had it come out some 15-20 years earlier! it's based on myra gail lewis book and that's a shame to begin with. it's a bad and inaccurate story of her life together with lewis and there is far better books about the killer, that could have made a much better and more interesting script. add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! the otherwise fine actor dennis quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon! he is walking around in the picture, talking about his "god-given talent" and as a spectator, you wish he'd show some of it on the screen too! silly gestures and funny faces and jerry lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly awful movie! the rest of the crew is almost as bad... save for winona ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. it's "grease" all over again and whenever jerry lee take a ride around memphis in his convertible, having the radio on in the car, the whole town is dancing to the music from it! everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved... from the wild man himself to sun records sam philips! and it's a damn shame! a charismatic and interesting artist like jerry lee lewis deserves better and i hope he took the 500.000 dollars he got from the deal and told the company to go f**k themselves... twice!
