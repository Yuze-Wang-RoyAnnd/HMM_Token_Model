ok, first off there may be a spoiler here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information. my subject line says it all but surely people will want to know why it's so stupid.<br /><br />first off, this film follows a bunch of yuppies as they go to a sports game in chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto. scary, huh? well, first of all, emilio is driving everyone in the world's most overblown rv/winnebago, tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it. so these guys are going to a sports game (i forget which, though likely the bulls or the white sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto), yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put espn to shame. yet they're smart enough to earn livings that would pay for the stuff, but are such sports fans that they don't even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so love.<br /><br />i gave up on the movie within a half hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful. they wind up in the ghetto, yet their main danger to their existence is denis leary. a white guy. i'm no racist, but come on. in anything resembling reality - and this film was trying to be an urban nightmare - denis leary would not be trying to kill emilio estevez, he'd be hitching a ride to get the f*** out of dodge himself!!!<br /><br />this is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created, although i'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema. if mst3k were still on, they surely would have devoted an episode to this one.
