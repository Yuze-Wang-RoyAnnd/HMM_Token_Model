this movie is horrendous. the acting is cheesy and laughable. if you know anything at all about rugby the match action is boring. in fact any episode of power rangers contains more realism than this movie. the 'action' consists of no more than one pass and a shot of guy landing over the try line or being tackled without the ball and hectic hand held shots of who knows what. it's impossible to tell. there is nothing of the excitement, skill and construction of try scoring that real rugby contains. as for the haka, this is a bunch of yanks trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about, much like the white rasta character that should have been left out of the film. next time there's a rugby movie made we can only hope that people who know rugby make it.
