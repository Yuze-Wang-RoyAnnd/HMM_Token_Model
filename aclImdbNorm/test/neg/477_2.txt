my brain was screaming "why do you keep watching! turn it off and go to bed!" but couch potatoness won out, and i watched until the predictable ending. i guess when it's bruce campbell i need to give it a chance.<br /><br />i find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget... time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. ted and bruce got their start on just such a movie, but they didn't seem to learn from sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie.<br /><br />it's sad, too, because bruce has always been a favorite. after the 70's and 80's, i just can't believe movies this bad are still being made. bruce, i'm really disappointed.
