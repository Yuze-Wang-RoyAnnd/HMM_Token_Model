i normally wouldn't waste my time criticizing a useless movie such as this. however, i'm off of work this week, so i have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless trivialities. to start, let me say that i frequently enjoy non-commercial, non-mainstream, non-american cinema. (feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography.) that said, there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the u.s. trust me, i've been tortured by hundreds of them. "lost in beijing" is one particularly bad film.<br /><br />the opening half hour is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneracy. this film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as kim ki-duk's "bad guy" (2001). <br /><br />1. women actually enjoy being raped; 2. rape should be glorified, praised, and respected; 3. feel free to rape any woman you like, because while your "doing" her she'll eventually start to like it and reach orgasm; 4. if you're wife gets raped, make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money, but if he doesn't pay, just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as compensation; 5. if you're wife gets raped, be sure to screw and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist, taunting her with lines like, "did he fu*k you like this?"; 6. if you're husband is a rapist, just accept it; 7. after you personally get raped, befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible.<br /><br />how can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters? they're nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways, but actually revel in their meaninglessness and support each other. don't misunderstand me though. i'm very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to my own. "ichi the killer" (2001) and "moonlight whispers" (1999) are very interesting portrayals of sado-masochism. "strange circus" (2005) is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse. "marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage. even religiously-based movies like "running on karma" (2003) and "samsara" (2001) have entertained me on occasion. the difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them, whereas "lost in beijing" has virtually none.<br /><br />it's known that people with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet, but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior. why, exactly, does bing bing eventually befriend and care for her rapist? why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior unconditionally? the filmmakers never bothered to tell us. even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and in the end served as a mere situational ploy. it all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour subsides. <br /><br />other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization. the reason you can't choose which person to root for is because they weren't developed properly. don't think that this movie has complex characters just because they're not clearly defined. on the contrary, the reason they're not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they're thinking. this is hardly a positive attribute of this movie. <br /><br />on the positive side, the camera-work and acting are quite good, but everything else just gets duller and duller as the film progresses. you can place this alongside trash like "turning gate" (2002), "what time is it there" (2001), "irreversible" (2002), and the aforementioned "bad guy."
