though it's better than most made-for-tv movies, "buried alive" is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge tale. there are so many plot holes in this one, it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re-writes. the ending has a nice twist to it, but it's hardly believable.<br /><br />the acting by jennifer jason leigh is terrific, as always, but tim matheson hams it up with cheesy one-liners that reminds one of jack nicholson in "the shining". don't bother with this one.
