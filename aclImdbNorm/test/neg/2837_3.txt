... brian? what the hell were you *on* when you signed to do this?<br /><br />i saw this recently at a festival, and it was greeted by howling laughter throughout. by the time the credits rolled, tears were streaming down the faces of many of the audience. <br /><br />the plot is a clunky melding of 'e.r.' and 'the x-files'; as cynically aimed at the tv audience as is possible to get without being sued. the sequences involving the abductions are hilarious- both yuzna's staging of the 'floating from the bed' and 'screaming mad george's pathetic plastic aliens drew gales of disbelieving, derisive laughter. <br /><br />limp, camp and stupid. my only hope is that it was an aberration- as awful as 'return of the living dead 3' was good.<br /><br />steev
