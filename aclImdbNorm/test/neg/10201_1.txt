this movie changed my life! hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and i still haven't recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 oscar nominations. and as brightly as the hulkster shines in this movie, you can't discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film. if you haven't seen this movie, drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy. i guarantee it will blow your mind. and if you don't like it, then i just have one question for you.... watcha gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and hulkamania runs wild on you!!!!
