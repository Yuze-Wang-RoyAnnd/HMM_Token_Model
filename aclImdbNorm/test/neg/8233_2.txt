this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. i now have many friends who are guards at dixon correctional, and i myself worked for 3 yrs at the superamerica store next to the krogers store the old lady was at. however, this is still the dumbest movie ever made, destined to be introduced by gilbert godfreid or rhonda shearer, if it hasn't been already. a bit of trivia, illinois doesn't even have parole hearings, and dixon prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals. the classic clucking/seduction scene is perhaps the most amusing piece of writing i've ever seen, especially with the suspenseful build-up
