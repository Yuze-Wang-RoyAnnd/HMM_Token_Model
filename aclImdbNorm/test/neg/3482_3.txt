i am astonished at the major comments here for this ok surf film. it really stems from the "california dreamin" school of barnyard to beach antics and isn't really plausible. the idea that the lead kid learn to ride a board so well in a concrete wave pool that he beats the real surfers at their game in the real ocean, is just plain silly. in australia where most urban teens do surf, this film was laughed at audiences took it all with a grain of sea salt. made in the 80s but with its heart in the 60s, it is fun to watch and looks and sounds good, but it is not a in a classic class at all. even the actors didn't outlast this. we're seriously in liquid bridge or ride the wild surf or beach blanket bingo land here. oz stars like occy and big wednesday hero gerry lopez are drafted in to add head nodding recognition to our farm boy's wave prowess, but it only made the crowd in the cinema guffaw. it is for 10 years olds who do not question much. it's not even in gods hands and that was silly too.
