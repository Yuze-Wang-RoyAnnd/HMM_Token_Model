nothing about this movie is any good. it's a formulaic predictable "romantic comedy" geared to make females force their significant others to watch. in other words, it's a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. if you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect. i was also forced to watch this with my g/f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together. i enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors. nothing good to say about this movie. the title says it all. 1/10 (one b/c i can't give it a zero.
