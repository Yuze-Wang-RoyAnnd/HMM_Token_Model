this film was strongly recommended by a friend and, being a great fan of brando, i ordered this film from harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive. i have seldom been so disappointed by a film. brando was good as a german officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. you never get to like or care for any of the characters (except brando, maybe). the acting was ok. story, what story? maybe that's the point. it's war after all, but i've seen far better war films. (lawrence of arabia, apocalypse now, even star wars) it was so boring i kept checking my watch...<br /><br />overall this is one of the worst films i have seen. please don't waste your time and money on this. may i also add that this is the first user comment i have written, i just had to let my feelings about this film known.<br /><br />by the way, my all time favourites are: casablanca, the godfather 1 &2, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, pulp fiction and amadeus. if you haven't seen them yet, please spare the time to do so. and amadeus must be in widescreen 2.35:1
