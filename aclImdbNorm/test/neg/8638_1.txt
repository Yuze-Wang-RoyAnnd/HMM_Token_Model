the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. i did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. if there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice then, it is high time to put an end to it. i seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings. a third rate tv serial will have more number of sets compared to this crap of a movie and i still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit of a movie. it ought to have been produced as a normal tv serial or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it out on the big screen. total waste of time and money. the movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way.with redundant sleep inducing dialogs and sets, this is the worst movie i have come across.
