this film has a really weird mixture of genres - toilet humour and action in one. it doesn't really pull it off - it should have stuck to one genre. the best thing i can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute.<br /><br />the most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when moses (sandler) and carter (wayans) decide to stop off at a hunting lodge/motel. i'm not quite sure what the point of this sequence is - it just seems gratuitous in the extreme. the proprietor of the hunting lodge ("charlie") is a very nerdy looking guy. for some reason, moses starts a conversation with charlie about porno, jacking off, homosexual sex, sex in a threesome... charlie's photo of his "wife" appears to be charlie dressed in drag. there is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene. anyway, the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked moses ends up with carter's gun up his butt and charlie sees them through the window. it all reeks of school boy humour about homosexuality - horrified and titillated all at the same time - which i don't find funny at all.<br /><br />i have a friend who is always raving about adam sandler movies. this is the first one i've seen - after this, i'm not sure i want to see any more.<br /><br />btw, this is my husband's account - he's seen happy gilmore, and he tells me it's quite good - maybe i should give sandler just one more chance.<br /><br />countess skogg
