loving the andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd, though brilliant, author, i eagerly looked forward to see this made-for-tv film. unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion. first of all the story/script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing andersen's fairy tales, presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me. secondly, pretty-boy actor (really... ever seen a picture of the real andersen?) kieran brew manages to portray hans christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was. though annoying and irritating like andersen, brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever. thirdly. the love story between andersen and the fictional jetta (whom actually should be henriette, the wife of edvard collin)... why? this man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie!<br /><br />i could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.
