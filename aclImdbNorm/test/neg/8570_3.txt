the headline describes it exactly. this dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical 'group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting/killing them off 20 years later' crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades. the only twist is instead of an angry ex-classmate or lovable psycho/loser, it was a nun. nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls, blah blah, girls accidentally/purposely drown the nun, blah blah, nun haunts the girls, people die, movie ends. the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes, which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat lady's arms) but even they couldn't make this a great movie. brian yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse. i'm sure glad i rented it and didn't buy it, or i'd be furious beyond belief. if you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses, go watch demonia or something. stay away from this garbage.
