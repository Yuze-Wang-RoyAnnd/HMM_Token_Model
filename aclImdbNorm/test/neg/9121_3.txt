i loved the first "american graffiti" with all my heart and soul that i considered it to be the best movie about rock n' roll along with being the best teenager flick i've ever seen. the first film spawned the careers of george lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic "star wars" before doing the prequels two decades later while making richard dreyfuss a star in jaws, close encounters of the third kind and other films as well.<br /><br />somehow without those two, the magic died off.<br /><br />"more american graffiti" shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where steve (ron howard) and laurie (cindy williams) are protesting against the vietnam war while their friend terry "the toad" fields (charles martin smith) is in the war himself and trying to get out. john milner (paul le mat) is still the hot drag racer in california where he never quite left home. the rest of the supporting actors in the film from candy clark's debbie (terry's girlfriend), to the pharaoh's gang members, along with harrison ford and others really don't do much. the original film showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock n' roll from buddy holly, the fleetwoods, chuck berry, fats domino, bill haley and the comets, buddy knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music. the soundtrack for "more american graffiti" is a mixture of rock, soul, country, hippie music, and whatever fitted the mood during the late 60's of protesting, drugs, sacrifices and more.<br /><br />after watching "more american graffiti" it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first film (with the exception of dreyfuss's character) where it wasn't necessary. this film wasn't necessary either as i was glad to see that neither lucas or dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects.
