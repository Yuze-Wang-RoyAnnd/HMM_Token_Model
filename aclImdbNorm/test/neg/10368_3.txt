so i decided to watch the entire puppet master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which i thought were all excellent. they had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that i really appreciated. about a year ago, i even saw puppet master vs. demonic toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.<br /><br />from the very beginning of this film, i knew it was in trouble. the cheesy power rangers-style egyptian skull villain who watches the puppets 'rita repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field! all of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films. i seriously doubt that when the first puppet master was being penned, the writers had visions of someday seeing an egyptian power rangers villain, totem monsters, annoying twenty-somethings who seriously can't act (and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent), and a lame "decapitron" puppet who's head can morph into the ghost of toulon.<br /><br />another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (part ii, since iii was a prequel). suddenly, the puppets are back at bodega bay inn, back in their case (minus blade), and toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again (he betrays them in part ii for his love of elsa). this isn't explained at all...and so with that, and all of this other junk thrown in, i was no longer amused.<br /><br />i'm a huge fan of ridiculous b movies, a connoisseur if you will. i even collect laser discs of rare b movies you can't find on dvd, and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies i have ever seen in my life. i still love those puppets, the original ones, blade, tunneler, pinhead, jester and the rest, and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn't broken, well, the series might still be alive and in good health. that being said, even though the reviews aren't so great, i'm really interested in checking out puppet master retro, sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes.
