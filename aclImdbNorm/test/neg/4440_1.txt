robert altman's "quintet" is a dreary, gloomy, hard to follow thriller where you finally give up after awhile because it's so complicated.<br /><br />i remember seeing this at my local twin on opening weekend with a full house. by the time the picture ended it was less than a quarter full. never have i witnessed such a mass exodus without there being an emergency to drive people out. that should tell you how bad it is. i believe it to be the worst film ever made involving such major talent in front of and behind the camera.
