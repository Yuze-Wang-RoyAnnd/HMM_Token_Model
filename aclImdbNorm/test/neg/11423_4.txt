first i must say that i enjoyed the first underworld movie. i was intrigued and curious to learn about vampires and lycans and so forth. in this last part (hopefully) of the series i just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. at least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes... now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem. they look and act like haughty white pasty humans. <br /><br />some ideas were neat... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. pity the acting was abysmal. the slave thingy too was feasible.<br /><br />other things just hit me as pathetic. spoilers now. castle walls that can be jumped over in a few steps ? enemies that don't attack during the day ? big bad ancient vampires that take ages to join combat and then run away from a fledgling lycan leader after a minute or so ? werewolves that den close to their enemies ? lycans that raid armouries... for what ? they don't use axes and swords or armor ! a vampire leader so inept he manages to have just about everyone against him ? the romance is so unconvincing its sad.<br /><br />so i don't recommend this film unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. some of the action is good to ok. certainly the vampires armor and weapons are interesting. otherwise a very weak script that was badly put together and uses all sorts of inane plot twists.
