"three" is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie. masquerading as a psychological thriller, it's closest relative is the monumentally superior "dead calm" (also featuring billy zane). "dead calm" provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidman's grieving parents attempting to re-define their relationship on an ocean cruise. they end up being terrorised by zane's adrift psycho-killer. it provided sharp, increasingly ratcheted suspense, a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded.<br /><br />"three" suffers from poorly drawn characterisation (the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding, hammy performances from the principal players. zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion. in "dead calm" he was menacing, wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. here he is bombastic, petulant slimy, and unravelled. and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year? ms brook is very picturesque, stunningly pretty, but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over-inflated by some sort of life-raft pump. they do, however, succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. the guy playing the voodoo-hexed manuel, the third component of this sorry triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. in fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes (excuse pun).<br /><br />plus sides: the scenery is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible.<br /><br />i'm guessing this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd. the reason for this is it's not very good. if you want something decent along these lines, get "dead calm." it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema.
