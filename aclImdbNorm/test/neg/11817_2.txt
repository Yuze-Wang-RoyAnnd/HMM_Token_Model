this is one heck of a sleazy film. like so many "women in chains" films, this one is chock full of lesbianism. however, unlike most prior films, which strongly implied this, black mama, white mama shows an awful lot of skin as a horny female prison guard leers at the women as they shower as well as has sex with one of the inmates. for the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft-core pornographic film--sort of like girls gone wild goes to prison! it's also a bad rip-off of the defiant ones, though in this case it's two hot females who hate each other who are chained together when they escape. whereas the original film is considered a classic, this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. that's because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap--cheap thrills, cheap writing and very cheap acting.<br /><br />pam grier is the "black inmate with an attitude"--a lady who was set up and sent to prison on this hellish island. margaret markov is a revolutionary. when they escape, they both can't stand each other and have opposite goals. however, since it is clich'e-driven, there's really no surprise in how the film ends--with their both becoming (gag me) friends.
