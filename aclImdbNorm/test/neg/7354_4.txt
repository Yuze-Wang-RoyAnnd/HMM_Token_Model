what could have been some majorly creepy stuff ends up being an incomprehensible, nutty motion picture that even the filmmakers themselves probably didn't understand. had they shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever, it might have been creepier, but as it stands now, this is a waste of time and brain cells. is anybody else getting sick of the whole "little kid drawing creepy pictures with crayon" thing? could there possibly be a bigger horror clich'e? probably not. i know, i know, it's from some different country, and it's far too refined and sophisticated for me to understand, so i shouldn't expect the "plot" to be spoon-fed to me, blah, blah, blah. whatever. i still say the movie blows.
