this is a stupid movie. like a lot of these karate movies it is badly written, awkward, and sometimes just stupid. the action really isn't all there and the movie overall leaves much to be desired. everyone here is talking jive, doing bad karate and doing a very bad job of acting. <br /><br />watch for scatman crothers in a small role, he is too good for this movie overall. jim kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. gloria hendry is real bad. all of them are, there are just so many parts to this film that make absolutely no sense. the supposed love/running away scene with hendry and kelly, what the hell was that? they destroyed that man's guitar, for no reason! <br /><br />and then there was the mandatory girls on trampolines!!! now what was that? they were in the movie for five seconds, then you never heard from them again!!! then there is the whole racially charged element of the movie, which is cool and all, but in this movie it goes absolutely nowhere. like i said, this is good for a laugh one time, but don't watch it again.
