so i got this from the rental store where i work before it was released (release is 8/21), just watched it today, and now i'm speechless. they could have had a decent movie here, but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways.<br /><br />first of all, the parts with john krasinski were funny, and are the only reason i gave it above a 3, but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible "serious" reflections on life between the main character (andrew keegan) and his girlfriend (the annoying lacy chabert). it would have been much, much better as a straight comedy ala lock, stock and two smoking barrels.<br /><br />i wanted to like it, because i think krasinski is funny and want to see him do well. the story wasn't bad either, just not very original. but the directing (and a lot of the acting) was terrible. i swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway.<br /><br />their carelessness is showcased when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a "dirty harry" gun is not a .357 magnum but a .45 (it was, as everyone knows, a .44 magnum).<br /><br />so see this if you 1- really like john krasinski 2- like to watch low-budget (and poorly-directed) movies or 3- have too much time on your hands (this is me!)
