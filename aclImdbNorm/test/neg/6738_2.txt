this has got to be the worst steven segal movie i have ever watched (even worse than eco-piffle like on deadly ground & fire down below). i'll start with the good points..., it's got stylish direction for a dtv movie and has wonderful scenry... that's it! the story dosen't really go anywhere, it's just an array of well staged set pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys (the body count can easily match tarantino at his bloodiest!). the plot is needlessly complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are. the acting (i use the term loosely) is mediocre at best, seagal's usual one constipated expression and wooden acting i can take but the others especially the brits were down right terrible.<br /><br />what's in the package? why are bad guys after it? is seagal being set up?<br /><br />who gives a s***!<br /><br />when i rented this movie at my local blockbuster (once i'd paid) the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the shop i could have picked! (i felt like punching him till my arm went numb)<br /><br />anyway, i haven't seen half past dead or out for a kill yet and i daren't go back for more humiliation at my store, but they can't be anyworse than this turkey<br /><br />the soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip - it just gave me a suuden urge for half a dozen asprins.<br /><br />all in all this is seagal at his worst! the guy who's gained about 100ibs and looks well past it, he's a guy who just doesn't no when to stop, he should retire gracefully now! and have a go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something.<br /><br />my rating 2/10 (1 point for scenery)
