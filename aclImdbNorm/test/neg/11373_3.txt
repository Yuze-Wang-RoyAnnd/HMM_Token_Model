i gave it a rating of 3 out of 10.<br /><br />and what's sad is, i made a point of looking up the movie schedule for that channel so i wouldn't miss seeing it. i wanted to watch this film because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, barbara wilson. as a lesbian, i expected to love this film.<br /><br />i don't know how ms. wilson felt about the film, but i found it a major disappointment.<br /><br />it should have been intriguing - it was a mystery - set in spain, and the main character, cassandra, is a language translator who gets contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers cassandra a great deal of money to locate her ex-husband, ben.<br /><br />there are secrets galore revealed, but for some reason it just didn't matter. it was like, oh, so what. i could not get involved with these characters or come to care about them, or feel for them. i couldn't even identify with these characters.<br /><br />i think a large part of the film's failure was the actress playing the main character. she looked old, tired, worn out, and as dull as dishwater. her hair was a perpetual mess, her baggy clothes were boring, and she just was not appealing or interesting.<br /><br />the best part of the film was getting to hear a dean martin recording, but even that was ruined by the weird make-up worn by the man who was dancing and lip-synching to the song. believe me - it was nothing like getting to see the suavely handsome mr. martin performing it.<br /><br />the ending is so syrupy you'll wish you had some pancakes to go with the syrup.<br /><br />
