i don't know, but the movie was just too similar to other movies i've seen. the ring, the eye, dark water, they're all the same to me. don't get me wrong, it's beautifully made, lovely camera work, great graphics, but that story is just too.. too common. in the end, it's the score that makes the suspense, you know: the screams, rumbles. the characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally, moving very slowly, surprised by anything they see. i know some people that love this kind of film, and if you do, being a well made movie, i guess it doesn't hurt to watch it. but if you've seen the movie i've mentioned above and didn't like them, then i'd suggest you don't bother.
