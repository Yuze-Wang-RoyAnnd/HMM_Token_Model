apparently i am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film. i have not seen it since i was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing i remember distinctly...<br /><br />the bunyip was terrifying!!! nightmare inducing terrifying. with the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running/hopping away for their lives...<br /><br />as a kid i also remember the animated hobbit... no worries. watership down? didn't blink an eye. dot and the kangaroo? it still haunts my dreams. and i have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy. maybe we can get a group rate on therapy.<br /><br />in short: one freaky film for its time.
