i saw the mst3k version of this film and it is a bad movie - but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor (unlike the movies that truly are awful). the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever. the main character, marv, is so pathetically morose, that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him. and he isn't very smart either, or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty. and even more pathetic than marv is his father, who is nothing but a drunken loser. the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so weakly executed, any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing. at least this movie made for a very funny mst3k episode, as mike and the 'bots do a great job making fun of it.
