i do not remember, at least in the last ten years or so, a movie that i have liked less than mama mia. from the non-existent acting to the atrocious singing, i was cringing at least once per minute. i don't believe i could even recall one brief segment that i tolerated. i do know that i will never watch this disaster again. i cannot believe that with such high expectations due to the talent - colin firth, meryl streep, pierce brosnan, that a movie could be such a flop. but to see the lack of acting skills shown, the seemingly drug-induced dancing, and then, horrors of horrors, to hear the singing of pierce brosnan(!), i cannot see how this movie will not make it into the hall of shame. definitely, a movie that never should have been made, and just in case you missed it the first time, one that i will never watch again.
