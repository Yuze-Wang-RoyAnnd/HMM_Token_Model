national lampoon's christmas vacation 2: cousin eddie's island adventure (2003) randy quaid, miriam flynn, dana barron, jake thomas, sung hi lee, eric idle, fred willard, ed asner, d: nick marck. embarrassing direct-to-video flop has oafish cousin eddie and family on an expenses-paid vacation to the south pacific by his boss, hoping the dunce won't sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey! idiotic spin off can't measure up to any of the vacation films (even european vacation!), with a question of whether or not the filmmakers thought the script was actually funny. not even quaid, willard, or asner can make it remotely watchable. 83 min., not rated. *
