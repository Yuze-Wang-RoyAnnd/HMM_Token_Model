ok...this may contain spoilers...but who really cares? do not, if you value the seconds in your life, waste your time on this pile of garbage. there is not one redeeming quality in this movie...and i say that as a full fan of the vacation series of movies. i loved the cousin eddie character from the other vacation movies...but he only works well as a supporting character. do i blame randy quaid for the failure of this movie? not at all. i think he's a great actor...but this film lacks any cohesion...the pacing is off...it's just plain unfunny. and the actor who plays the "third"...jake thomas...was just awful, more than likely due to a real lack of direction. i don't know why...but his whole character creeped me out.<br /><br />some people say that this is a horrible movie because chevy chase and beverly d'angelo aren't in it...that has nothing to do with it. the script, directing, acting...special effects...everything is a train wreck. with orphans. and kittens. oh...and the train ran over some old people too.<br /><br />please, whatever you do...stay away from this filth! i call it filth because it dirties the name of the vacation franchise.
