i am not quite sure i agree with the director of this version of the scarlet pimpernel. i imagined sir percy blakeney a very calm, seemingly lazy aristocrat. this particular sir percy blakeney appears to be teeming with overwhelming energy and volatility. i did not appreciate the houdini, james bond, mission impossible style escapes that sir percy engineered either. in the previous versions, wit was the tool for escape, not technology. neither were the characters of marguerite and chauvelin adequately portrayed. there seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters.<br /><br />i do not wish to assign any blame, for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation. had the director's interpretation coincided with mine, perhaps i might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals.<br /><br />i much preferred the version from 1982. anthony andrews was quite efficient as the imperturbable, calm fop. so were jane seymour and ian mckellen. in my opinion, the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption. i recommend sticking with the previous versions, either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982.<br /><br />
