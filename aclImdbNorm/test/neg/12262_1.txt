this film could have been great- but wasn't. amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. the main star of the film plays a good lead role. he is convincing and has those scary italian eyes. however, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. the opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. it looks like gay porno. fortunately no one stripped off. the rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish. the prison sequence was the best part of the film- although irrelevant. the movies soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using cooledit and some sample cds. it is boring, repetitive and extremely lame. in fact the whole film is lame. get out while you still can!
