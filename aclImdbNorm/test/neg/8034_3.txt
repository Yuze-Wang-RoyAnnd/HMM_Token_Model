riccardo freda may have a good reputation; but since we now that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great mario bava; it's clear that he wasn't one of italy's most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies. this film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot; it's a sprawling mess and overall, i'd even have to go as far as to say that tragic ceremony is worse than freda's insipid giallo effort, the iguana with the tongue of fire. freda apparently disowned this movie, and i certainly don't blame him! the plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. they happen upon a house while searching for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremony...ho hum. the film features a lead role for camille keaton, who would go on to star in the exploitation classic i spit on your grave some years later, but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers. the film features one decent gore scene towards the end, but this really isn't enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there. i have a high tolerance for rubbish italian films that don't make sense - but even i couldn't stand this one. miss it, miss nothing!
