i saw this movie on the shelf at blockbuster and thought it looked cool. the dvd case touted so many great actors and i wondered to myself, "why have i never heard of this movie?" then i turned over the case and saw the director, lee tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself. <br /><br />first of all i want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, i think i should explain why this movie is so terrible. okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters. this is the worst role i've ever seen chazz palminteri play and i'm surprised he would do something this ridiculous. however, under-appreciated yet talented actors must earn their money. palminteri plays a one dimensional police detective who comes off about as dumb as a c-movie mob henchman. him, along with the lead detective (the poorly directed nolte), the great but simple michael madsen, and the late chris penn (whose role along with madsen's was completely thrown away) make up an elite squad of la detectives tasked to rid the city of mobsters sometime in the late 30s or 40s. the movie introduces this squad as cops who will break every law to make sure those who think they're above the law don't operate in their city. at the beginning of the film the cops rough up a local restaurant, grab an alleged mobster (william peterson) and take him to a place they call the mulholland falls. they toss him off one of the cliffs on mullholland drive and this is supposed to demonstrate how serious these guys are about ridding the city of crime. whatever. this was nothing more than a cheap excuse to use a crappy title that's designed to make you think of la and its famous sites. somewhere later on they find the dead body of jennifer connelly and the plot begins. <br /><br />on to the direction which was nothing short of amateur and weak! aside from the fact that the characters were b-movie quality, the overacting by those such as treat williams, the guy who plays the chief of police, and the awful daniel baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie seem like it was lee tamhori's first film. there's not one good performance in the movie aside from maybe melanie griffith, who some might argue was the worst in the movie (she won a razzie for this film). in the end, it was her character that was not that great and she really didn't have much to work with. <br /><br />as with any bad movie, it all begins with the writing, and this script was no gem. plot is formulated simply on the basis of setting up the next scene and never takes into consideration characters' motivations. the way the characters behaved was unbelievable. cops taking the law into their own hands is believable within the right circumstances (see la confidential) but in this case it looked like these guys could get away with anything, including murder, and never bat an eye about cleaning anything up. i guess we as an audience are just supposed to assume that no one saw anything and that people won't ask questions. everything about the story is predictable and is spoon fed so well that we understand everything that's going to happen a good while before the characters do. however, it doesn't make us feel smart, but rather makes us angry at how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there aren't any heroes in this movie. <br /><br />in the end, the best component of the movie was the great score by david grusin. from the beginning, it invoked a since of chinatown, which quickly faded when i realized how unbelievable just about everything in the film was. it didn't surprise me to learn that it made a whopping eleven million in the box office. what i will say is that this film is worth watching for a few laughs. nick nolte's acting is like an unsuccessfully domesticated junkyard dog and i laughed every time he tried to be serious. i also nearly fell on the floor at each of the slow motion shots used in the film (i think there are three with one during a key fight scene). when you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have some problems. so, even with my negative criticism, i will recommend this movie solely for the purpose of enticing laughter, that is, if you appreciate the good movies like la confidential.
