in a up and down career with all sorts of movies, this is altman's one try at science fiction, and it clearly shows that it's not his forte.<br /><br />the film is practically incomprehensible. it seems a disastrous combination of experimental theater pretentiousness and a major studio trying to jump on the post-star wars bandwagon (not that this film is at all modelled after that one, but you can imagine that the studio signed on hoping for a much different paul newman sci-fi film). the story is nonexistent, the characters remain strangers to us all the way through.<br /><br />altman has packs of dogs feeding on dead bodies throughout the movie, obviously straining to make some sort of point. but since the movie is so poorly thought out, starting with the lack of plot on up, it really isn't about anything at all.<br /><br />the production designed is confused, the photography is undone by the blurs on the edges, and the score is terrible. however, "quintet" does have one redeeming feature. not only is the movie clearly filmed out in the snow and ice, but the interiors are kept cold as well. you see the actors' breath in every scene. you really feel the cold.
