this movie lacked credibility for two reasons. one, no mayor of a major city, and new york is certainly as major as it gets. would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, jewish or defenseless. at 62-years of age, i have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. even "escape from new york," which was fictional, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn't resort to such deep-seated violence. in this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. also, in this movie and i have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the "escape" movie. secondly, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be. on the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed. yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. we are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. why did the outside gangs come to help? i believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. what did they come for? another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack bronson's character? this was not a great movie and i could go on, but i won't.
