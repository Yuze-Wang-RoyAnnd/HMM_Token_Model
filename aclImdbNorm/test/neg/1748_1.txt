i was so offended by this film that i had to write something about it, so please humour me.<br /><br />its only redeeming virtue, outside of some good acting, is that it doesn't go on past 107 minutes. even that length is about 30 minutes too long.<br /><br />comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark 'the grifters,' but i can't see it. they are two different films altogether. the closest 'swindled' comes to an existing film is 'the sting,' made in 1973. it borrows (sorry, steals) liberally from this splendid george roy hill 'entertainment,' which is exactly what is was. i enjoyed it because it didn't pretend to be anything else.<br /><br />there are so many red herrings in 'swindled' that i thought i was in a fish tank. it's very confusing, but that's only one of its many problems. the principal one is this: if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else, where everyone is conning, we have no 'anchor' to ground us. the inevitable result is a mish-mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks.<br /><br />just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable. surely a basic film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to 'care' for someone. we can't 'care' for anyone here: they're all swines. it might have worked as a rakish comedy, but it plays it straight from beginning to end.<br /><br />if you want to see this film, read no further. big 'spoiler' coming. sorry, but i have to do it.<br /><br />there's so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn't strain credulity -- it destroys it. the ending is absolutely ridiculous -- a 'murder' in a crowded airport that isn't really a 'murder' at all? and the 'murdered' guy, blood-soaked, simply stands up, brushes himself off, and walks away, fake blood dripping, with the booty? all while the police and hordes of people are looking on, and no one intercedes? the director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we're supposed to buy into this. noirish b-movies from the 1940s did better. <br /><br />i'm a great fan of european flicks, but this confirms that schlock doesn't always come from hollywood. as far as 'swindled' is concerned, my judgment lies with a famous line from the oft-misspoken producer samuel goldwyn, who knew all about schlock: 'include me out'.
