with nbc's "thank god you're here", the network may be trying to replicate the successes of abc's improv sitcom, "who's line is it anyway?" in which host drew carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast regulars asked to improvise scenes of some kind. in the nbc show, dave foley and co-host dave alan grier oversee a handful of notable comedians who must improvise their way through various scenes which all begin with "thank god you're here." it takes itself far too seriously (why must viewers be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before), both co-hosts seem less then enthused. after watching the continuously sub-par, unfunny attempts by the actors to solicit some laughs, i am left wondering whether the live audience is genuinely laughing at what transpires, or whether they, too, are improvising. expect this time slot filler to be a very short-lived one.
