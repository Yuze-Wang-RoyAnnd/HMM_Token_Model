this movie's script is indistinguishable from others, most notably the core, another bad movie. it's pretty clear why luke perry doesn't get much work, but to see the beloved lt. commander worf (michael dorn) resigned to something like this is just sad.<br /><br />i really can't think of one plot twist that isn't seen coming a mile away. that's not an exaggeration.<br /><br />special effects are very poor, even by tv standards. the lava flow at the beginning of the movie signaling the coming global disaster, starts things off at a very amateurish level. and it gets no better from that point on.
