after loomis gives a quick recap of micheal myers we flashback to 1989 where jamie is kidnapped by the man in black before the burning police station explodes. micheal returns to haddonfeild once again to find jamie and his baby. in this version the loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro-active than he is in the final cut. the score is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, none of the electric guitar bs. and the ending makes a tad more sense. for these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense, and cuts back on the gore factor (halloween, unlike say the "friday the 13th" franschise, was never about blatant gore) is why i prefer this bootleg producer's cut. not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold, it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible. the whole cult plot is still very stupid, as is micheal fathering a kid <br /><br />my producer's cut grade: c- <br /><br />my theatrical cut grade: d-
