this slightly ponderous late 50's sci-fi-horror schlock isn't entirely a loser. it's about a manned space rocket that crash lands in a remote area. a bunch of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma; he's being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. anyway, the title alien monster soon raises it's head causing general havoc, including partial head removal.<br /><br />the main problem with the film is it's pacing. it takes quite a while for the blood beast to appear, and he really only comes into his own in the last 20 minutes or so. he is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but that's really not a problem as he provides a fair amount of comic relief. at the end of the movie where we have the final stand-off and this ludicrous creature starts talking with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier, you will be doing well not to have a giggle. so too in the brilliant x-ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating about in the astronaut's body - it's just too funny for words.<br /><br />but unfortunately, the fun moments in night of the blood beast come too few and far between. if you're a 50's sci-fi nut though then it's well worth checking this one out. just don't expect too much.
