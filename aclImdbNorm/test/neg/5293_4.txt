travolta, thurman, the rock, vaughn, keitel and so on. one should think that this star parade of great actors could really heat up this movie, but no. travolta takes on the role as chili palmer again, but this time we have already seen the gangster who tries hes luck in the hard world of movie making, its not funny anymore. this is a typically problem in hollywood, they think that if the first was good, the second will be twice as good, no, the first was original, the second cant be, hey hollywood try to understand originality cant be duplicated, you got to give us a new twist, not just the same movie again made with a bigger budget. i constantly found my selves hardly laughing when i was watching this movie, but still it got a lot of cool actors like harvey keitel, james woods, vince vaughn and the rock and for that and that only! <br /><br />4/10
