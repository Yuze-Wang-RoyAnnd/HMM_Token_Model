"an evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the louvre museum" that's all i think, the summary of the movie and the movie itself ! which i think it's one of the worst french or non french movies ever made in the history of cinema ! <br /><br />nothing good in here except the music (of the credits only !), some tender moments of (sophie marceau), and of course the movie's finale shot.. not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching that crap but also for being so perfect as one magical c.g.i work that was too good to be true in here ! <br /><br />by the way i want to change the plot summary to be like this "an evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies".. just like this one for sure.
