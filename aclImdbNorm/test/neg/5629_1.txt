spoilers follow - and i haven't even seen it.<br /><br />let me guess... the murder is related to the evil property developer wanting to develop the riverside, and dickens was murdered because he was trying to uncover a similar dastardly plot. if anybody who's seen it could let me know if i'm half right, you'll have saved me the time it might take to watch something worthwhile and the rest of us will know to steer clear of both this film and its enthusiastic reviewers. on the other hand, it *sounds* intriguing; but if it was any good would it *really* be given away with a sunday rag? and what sort of track record does foley have anyway?<br /><br />...so, as a public service, i managed to sit through it. it's worse than 'swept away'. really. i've read stories by eight-year-olds with more drama than this. truly awful. and i was half right.
