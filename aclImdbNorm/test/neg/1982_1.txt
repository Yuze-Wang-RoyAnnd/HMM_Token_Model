when the spirits within was released, all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like final fantasy. this is a different story, for better or worse. the familiar settings, characters, music, story, and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. the problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right.<br /><br />the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy, switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic, but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing.<br /><br />the cg itself is exceptional, but i can't say it's the best i've ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters, although i must admit that advent children's characters moved much more naturally.<br /><br />the plot is virtually a black hole. it's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring sephiroth back for one last fight. old characters reappear, but serve no real purpose other than to please fans. character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end. but it's packed with neat-looking fight scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans wanted anyway.<br /><br />in the end, advent children is a very flashy, but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy vii than a real sequel.<br /><br />by the way, don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting not useful. it just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys/fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly.
