i'm from texas so i thought i knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. whenever she was on the screen i couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. take about stage presence! there seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also. there was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away. all the hit men in this movie seemed a bit deaf, no one had to sneak up on them. the one handed 'hero' of this movie was so whiny and ineffective that it was funny. the bar-fight was pretty funny. there is a priceless scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judging from their expressions, it wasn't good for either one of them. it made me laugh out loud. this movie is on the 50 movie pack martial arts set if you want to see a lot of bad movies (with a few decent ones).
