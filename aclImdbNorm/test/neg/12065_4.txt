its difficult to be too tough on brad sykes, a hard-working guy doing what he loves, there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other microbudget directors. check out the minuscule crew credits on camp blood, there is none of the usual thanking everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in, its brad and his buddies and thats it, no pretentious rubbish. jennifer ritchkoff isn't your average horror flick heroine, but does well enough for you to hardly notice, bethany zolt looks like a star and joseph haggerty is so funny it hurts. the clown is hardly an original horror film bad guy, but the design is good, shemp moseley does a decent job of bringing him to life and the image clashes nicely with the rural backdrop. camp blood is horror as blue collar and basic as it gets, not a good thing, not a bad thing, just a thing.
