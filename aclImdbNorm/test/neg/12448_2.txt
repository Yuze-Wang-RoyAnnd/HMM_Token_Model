this was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad audio (even though i was watching a dvd, sometimes i couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). the plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics, bi-polars, and caricatures. character development was awful... the bratty little sister (why was she even written into the script?), the nagging mom (again - what purpose?) the whiny girlfriend (why didn't he dump her long ago?), the 'dark suits' gang (how original - couldn't think of a better name i guess), the drug dealer's hot girlfriend (gotta have a hot latina if your going to have la gangs i guess, but really...), etc etc can't believe i watched the whole thing.
