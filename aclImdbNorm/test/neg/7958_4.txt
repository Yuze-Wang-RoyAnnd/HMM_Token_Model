deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about. the story line is ok, cinematography is outstanding, screenplay and acting are way below average. i guess the blame is to the citizens of uttar pradesh in india from where her original set was destroyed in 2000. this resulted in a totally different cast, i just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if it had the original shabana azmi, nandita das and aamir khan. the current actors lisa ray (who's just good for squirming in bombay dyeing bedsheets) and john abraham are pathetic, need basic lessons in acting. seema biswas, raghubir yadav and kulbushan kharbabda have saved the movie as much as they can. the kid had done an outstanding job. the editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would have expected from deepa. great subject, sends out a strong message about a practice which is still pretty rampant in rural india but falls short of the standards deepa set for herself in fire and earth. watch it once...when its on dvd, don't bother paying $10 to see it....well its out beats the average hindi movie any day
