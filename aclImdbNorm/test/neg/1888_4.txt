it's proof that movie makers and their financiers treating their audience with contempt isn't a new phenomena as it was done as early as the 1940s and house of dracula is a great example . you'd think having a film with dracula , the wolf man and frankenstein's monster the producer would dictate to the screenwriter to have all three appear in a scene . they had a chance with house of frankenstein then when they had a second bite of the cherry they blew it again with house of dracula . to lose one chance is a misfortune , to lose two smacks of cynical money making <br /><br />it's obvious the producers are beyond caring . larry talbot turns up again even though he was shown to die in the previous film which sums up the cynicism of the franchise . it also shows what a poor screenplay it is and we're mistreated to some awful plot turns like talbot's condition being cured by a special type of plant which will soften his skull . i'm thinking screenwriter edward t lowe might have had his skull softened if this is the type of stuff he comes up with <br /><br />director erie c kenton can't improve on the script and throws in a few spanners of his own . for example talbot is startled to see dr edelmann snatch a lift on a cart but nonchalantly watches edelmann climb a wall and jump in to the ch^ateau courtyard . one can't help thinking talbot's reaction shots were mistakenly switched round at the editing stage <br /><br />lon chaney jnr is famous for his roles in horror movies but didn't have much of a career outside them . perhaps that's down to the fact he's not a good actor and here he commits the worst type of acting - being very wooden . it's not entirely his fault though because all the characters spout rather awful dialogue and are all rather wooden due in part to kenton's lackluster directing <br /><br />house of dracula feels a million miles away from james whale 1931 film and its sequel from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to end on . but ironically universal decided to make one more movie to wrap up their franchise with a horror comedy starring abbot and costello
