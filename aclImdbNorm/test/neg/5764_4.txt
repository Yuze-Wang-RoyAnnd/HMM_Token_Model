a group of friends discover gold deep inside an old mine. but by taking the gold and thinking they've hit it big, they awaken a long dead miner who's hell bent on protecting his treasure. "miner's massacre" is a chintzy b-horror movie in the extreme. you've got all your familiar clich'es, your group of intellectually-impaired teenagers, characters going off on their own to investigate strange noises, a few pop-scares, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady who everyone thinks is nuts (played by top-billed karen black no less), and so on. nevertheless, it's done in an amusing, non-pretentious fashion that makes the film mindlessly entertaining in a "so bad, it's good" kind of way. the characters and dialog are what you'd expect from this type of film
