this movie is not worth anything. i mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to hollywood movies! this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name. neal n nikki seriously sucked! never watch this movie. as for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. tanisha couldn't have worn less and uday chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (all of that halla re was amazingly stupid) the songs are eh, and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... bottom line, i hated the movie. do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it! buy the cd, if you must. (as i said, the songs are eh.) at least it is better then the movie.
