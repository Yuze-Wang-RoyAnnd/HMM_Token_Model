okay, i like to give the benefit of the doubt. i watched his show.<br /><br />it isn't funny to me. all i remember was a lot of "weird" noises and yelling. i don't think i even cracked a smile. the only thing that somewhat resembled humour was his anjelina jolie/jennifer aniston bit. i think you can get dumber by the minute watching it though.<br /><br />also, what's with the "ask whitey?" section? is that a ripoff of "ask a gay dude?/black man?" from chappelle's show? isn't it that obvious? but when chappelle did it, he was exposing the ignorance of the subject. like borat. but what's up with picking random white people and yelling stuff at them? that's not funny, its just plain dumb.<br /><br />and i'm pretty sure i heard certain "jokes" of his somewhere else... it seems abit like he's 'plagerising' bits & pieces, throwing in some "loud" yelling.<br /><br />anyway, it wasn't funny. seriously. don't even waste your time.
