this movie has got to be the biggest disappointment i've ever experienced with a film. the acting is horrific, the suspense build up minimal, and the plot overall is ridiculous. i found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim, because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery. anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried. i'm dismayed that a sequel is planned, because it means they'll be asking us to once again swallow a sub par plot line. if this is an example of raw feed's work, i think i'll be avoiding any and all future films by them.
