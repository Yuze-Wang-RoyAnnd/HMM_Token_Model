and parading around a 14-year-old girl in a thong swimsuit is one of them. to fans of this movie, i'd like to ask: would you allow your daughter to walk around a resort dressed like that? and would your 14-year-old be able to handle the reaction she'd get from men? if yes, i'd like to know why, on both counts. a suit like that is a clear invitation to men; it's hypocritical to suggest that's not. <br /><br />and on another point, what teenage girl would ever claim her father was her lover, without the excuse of severe mental problems? that's almost as disgusting as the swimsuit. <br /><br />simply put, some things are just not funny or appropriate, and they never will be.
