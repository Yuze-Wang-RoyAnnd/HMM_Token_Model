talk about rubbish! i can't think of one good thing in this movie. the screenplay was poor, the acting was terrible and the effects, well there were no effects. i can't believe the writer of this movie did identity, everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish.<br /><br />the front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes. i looks like a scary villain, but like the old saying "never judge a book by it's cover", the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out. one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs, terrible. the setting was bad enough, like they could of set the whole thing in lapland but no, a tropical island instead.<br /><br />i took this movie as a spoof, which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects. you can argue that i haven't watched the first one, but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldn't attempted it.<br /><br />the biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were home made, and that carrot was a complete embarrassment. if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty. the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island.<br /><br />lastly the acting in the film was painful, it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through.<br /><br />in conclusion i give this film: 0 stars out of 5
