first of all. i do not look down on americans. i know lots of people that are intelligent people from the usa. but this movie is so utterly bad, that i just had to comment on it.<br /><br />first of all...movies are mostly far from the truth. this movie is no exception. lots of scene's are so incredibly false. for example the departure of the 2 space ships. you see them drop off the full tanks in space. just a small distance from each other. remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? just a tinsy winsy part that came off. in here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship. what idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time ??? second of it is that the russian station is a piece of (s)crap. i hate to bring this up to you, but astronauts nowadays go to russia. since their equipment is much more reliable then nasa's. the space shuttle is retired. and nasa uses it just to pay off the bills. and there is no better alternative for it. and the list of whoppers goes on and on. this is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious. and i know half as much as these guys do. but the most annoying part ( read: the whole movie ) is the propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with. my god !!!! i thought i was looking at a cnn business commercial for like an hour. the actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, start up fights, ignore the police, etc, etc... but when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ?? maybe i lack the feeling of being a true "patriot", that can sing the national anthem backwards in swahili. whilst riding with george bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery is empty. but this movie was too much for me too handle. and when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the american flag out of my hiney. i realised that i was glad this movie was finally done. i do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded, stereotyping, propaganda movie. but i pity them. this represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. as long as "uncle sam" thinks you are a good patriot. where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated, no one cares.
