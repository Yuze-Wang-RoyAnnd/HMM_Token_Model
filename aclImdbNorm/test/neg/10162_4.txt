there were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. randy bowers (john wayne) stopping at a 'halfway house' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing "the loveliest night of the year." <br /><br />it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang, to get ed rogers' $30,000. randy is an investigator who "works alone," who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping (with ed's daughter sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. it all moves along fairly quickly. only one too many chases after randy slow it down.<br /><br />we even get george hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- marvin black, the vilest villain, as well as the good citizen, matt the mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally, "ah, i'm fed up with this!" you can find george playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial "the lost city" (1934).<br /><br />i think this is the only 'lone star' film in which the title relates to, or is mentioned in the film! sally offers her hand to randy and says, "he's not alone anymore!" then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake. sally's running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff.<br /><br />not that bad considering everything, but not that great either. i'd really give it a 4 and a half.
