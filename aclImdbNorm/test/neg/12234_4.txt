1st movie comment ever! i'll start with saying "come on! wasn't that bad... was it?"... no it was't that bad actually. i laughed and giggled enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbish.<br /><br />it's completely different, this and epic movie (epic movie sucked bad.. doh!). "how so?" people would ask. i'll tell you how. this movie is not as nearly as pointless, not to mention that the stupid (and i say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie. not the best around but hey... what would you expect - look at the poster! some people said it was stupid, i find that when writing a comment one should be more objective (my own opinion) but yeah, of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! look, i'm not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century. what i am telling is that, if you happen to see the movie somewhere, please don't carve your eyes on the opening credits. see what it's all about - who knows, you might like it a bit.<br /><br />i give it 4/10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
