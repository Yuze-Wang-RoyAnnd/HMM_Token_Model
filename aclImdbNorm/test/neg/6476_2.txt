i was 12 years old when i saw the original film (i lived in italy and the italian title was "fbi, operation cat!") that was a fun film and not just for kids. this awful remake it's pathetic even for a 5 year old! what possessed disney to ruin their reputation and the memory of a lovely film i don't know and i just can't believe it. even the title song in the original film (both original version and the dubbed italian version) was extremely nice and creating the mood for the story. on this remake the title song is even worst than the movie itself. it was just nice to see dean jones even if for just a cameo appearance, he was a regular on the great old disney's films. i cannot honestly see anything else positive in this remade movie.
