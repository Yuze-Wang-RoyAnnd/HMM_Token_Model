absolutely the worst experience i have ever been through. i think my eyes started bleeding. i actually got sick the night after watching this. i don't even consider this a movie. movies are supposed to be worthwhile and entertaining. this fails horribly. i could not make it through the entire film, so because the ending could be greatest phenomenon in motion picture history, this gets a 1 for that small chance. otherwise it would be a flat 0.<br /><br />i can't see how national lampoon, or let alone any organization, would sponsor this atrocity. renting this dvd is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. only watch this if you want to make ever other movie you will ever watch seem great. <br /><br />without question this is the worst movie i have ever seen.
