kazuo komizu, who hasn't made one decent film, directed this "notorious" shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its japanese release.<br /><br />yes, it does feature scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but so what? it has the style of a bad american porn film shot and badly photographed by ed powers ("dirty debutantes") and is incredibly slow.<br /><br />it seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social acts.<br /><br />there is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.<br /><br />just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this. on the contrary, that kind of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning. it's a shame production companies don't realize that.<br /><br />one reviewer here (zombiekilla81) commented that the film's "near obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors that killed it. i disagree. the subject matter is never the issue. the issue is how that subject matter is treated. in entrails of a beautiful woman, it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.<br /><br />personally, i like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. this nikkatsu horror/pink hybrid is woeful.
