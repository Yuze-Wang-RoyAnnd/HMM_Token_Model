i have just caught this movie on tcm, and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this was the best mgm could serve up to him. it is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. it featured two of my favourite<br /><br />players in eve arden (completely wasted) and dean stockwell(the best actor in the film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady frances gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical. john hodiak played his role ok, but the script let him, and the rest of the cast, down very badly. i gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography. it would have been on the first half of the program when double features were the go.
