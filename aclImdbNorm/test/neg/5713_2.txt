what's up with this movie? does mr. lyne and his writers think that a sado-masochistic fling between two screwed up yuppies can carry a feature length movie? maybe if it had some comedic elements (which is doesn't, at least intentionally), or there were some additional dramatic elements (which there are not), or maybe if it was hardcore. no, it's simply the history of the affair; a chronology of a bunch of r-rated trysts. ho-hum, who cares? "nine  1/2  weeks" deserves every razzie nomination it got. it's a loser.<br /><br />and by the way, what's up with roger ebert and his rave review? where was his head back in 1986?
