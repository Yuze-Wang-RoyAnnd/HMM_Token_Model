if you are a six-year-old boy who's into dinosaurs, you will love this movie. if you are anybody else, you'll be rolling your eyes about every 15 seconds. if you want to start picking on things like the acting, the special effects, the dialogue, or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest amount of sense, you'll have plenty of material. if all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid, it will do just fine. that said, there's a lot of kids' entertainment out there that's much smarter, and some of it is even bearable or enjoyable for adults. unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur mood, you're probably better off looking for something else.
