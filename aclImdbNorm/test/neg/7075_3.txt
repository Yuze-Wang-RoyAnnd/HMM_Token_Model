i saw this movie, and i do like horror movies.<br /><br />i did not know what to expect, but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it. the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. especially jenna dewan as the exciting/evil tamara.<br /><br />the hardest thing about horror movies, is to make a good ending. but there the movie failed. for a change, a end-scene in a hospital, where suddenly all employees are gone. first you see doctors and nurses running around, but then they all went home?<br /><br />no cries for help while being chased by tamara, escaping to the roof (also a smart move...not) and off course a kind of open ending.<br /><br />no....the movie started great, the main part was nice to watch, but they really messed up the ending using all clich'es from bad horror movies. jeffrey reddick failed in my eyes with this movie, after making some really quality movies like final destination 1 and 2.<br /><br />if you like a good horror full of clich'e endings, tamara is a good movie to watch. for me, i like movies which surprise me.
