yes, dumb is the word for this actress. i know many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her empty headed and boring to watch with her bleached hair, lip gloss, and not so perfect body. watch her walk away in those jeans, showing a rather large butt. her butt spreads beyond her shoulders. what does that tell you? as for the leading man, played by gorgeous mark humphrey, he was perfectly cast. a charmer. however, he and lancaster just didn't match. she was out of place opposite this good looking guy. good acting by susan glover as the sister. angela galuppo had a small role and was okay. but the film's director philippe gagnon, wasted too much footage on lancaster. after a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability. and what a bitch of a wife she was. snooping on her husband, being obnoxious to him and just a plain spoiled brat. was happy to see her hit with the dart gun. i thought it might be the end of her. but alas, the script tells us otherwise. after torturing myself and watching this loser again, i still came up with the same criticism. lancaster is boring to watch. this time around her hair, folks. her hair constantly in her face, constantly tossing it back, became annoying. i question the writer, alexandra komisaruk's reason why a good looking wealthy man like philippe would even bother with the likes of a bimbo like allison. when there were so many attractive intelligent women, with class, to choose. he picks this nothing. is this the rochester/jane eyre thing? oh well, it's all a matter of taste, i guess. this sarah lancaster is not my cup of tea, folks.
