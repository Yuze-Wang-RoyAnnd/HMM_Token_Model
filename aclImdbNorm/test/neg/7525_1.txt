guy pearce looks like and acts like a calvin klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear levi's jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding buffalo because they realize that buffalo like levi's too. in every scene, guy pearce looks like he is saying, "look at me, i am so pretty!" as a hero, his character is a total wimp. in every scene that calls for courage, pearce gets the short end of the stick. spoilers: yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like spiderman). around the same time, the time machine seems to cause a nuclear explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. strangely, even though pearce and his gal-pal mumba are about a foot away from the last morlock that gets killed; seconds later pearce, mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. now that is fast running!!! jeremy irons as the king of the morlocks is great. he really makes the movie a lot better than it was. mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much acting in this movie. the scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. even though the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. the original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. the period characters were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. the original version of this movie made the past seem like the real base of the characters. this new version lacks substance and feeling. the scenes in which pearce deals with the death of emma and then fails to save her from her fate are very good. the issue of the morlocks being cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher shop filled with knives and cutlery, yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. also silly is the giant pit full of water and bones. all through the underground, the morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. so how can all those skeletons be in the pit? it seems like there are some morlocks that bar-b-que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other morlocks only like filleted flesh?? and where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? as i was watching the dozens of morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. all these issues were never addressed. at the end of the movie, pearce is holding mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, mandingo. one other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop lion king music which is in the background. once pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the lion king music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that african moaning singer (is it peter gabriel or paul simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the lion king jungle music. i watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but i think that elton john should probably look into this matter. time machine was a mediocre movie with some good fx. see it once, then forget it.
