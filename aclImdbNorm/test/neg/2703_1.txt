as a cartoon, the spytroops movie was pretty bad. it is only 44 minutes long, yet several battles occur culminating with the destruction of the cobra headquarters. one downer was the very beginning of the movie. an animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been some kind of battle simulation. that right there was a major turn-off and made the rest of the movie lack credibility. then there was the issue of shipwreck tied up along with his parrot, and tossed into some room where nobody had checked for several days. whatever happened to surveillance cameras?<br /><br />the cobra base only had a handful of characters, and the rest were bat robots. aside from a lot of corridors the cobra base did not seem to have any weapons, tanks, trucks, or any other equipment. then there was the silly notion that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. the plot was silly even if this was intended for small children. spongebob, powerpuff girls, and even barney the dinosaur give more attention to their plots.<br /><br />the characters were not bad, except that i could never understand anything destro was saying, and the cobra commander was silly and not much of a villain. in fact, except for storm shadow and xartan, the rest of the cobra characters were comical and hardly impressive. the gi joe characters were pretty good. scarlett, agent faces, road block and snake eyes were my favorites here. shipwreck and beach head were the worst. shipwreck is written as a goof-ball and beach head sounded like some 1990s surfer dude. i guess the writer, larry hama was trying to make a character that appealed to teenagers, but he was a decade off the mark. just listening to beach head's spicoli surfer-talk (fast times at ridgemont high) i was wondering if the new gi joes were going to smoke a dube before the big mission.<br /><br />the cgi was pretty good, except that cobra commander had a jerking spastic walk, and the vehicles did not look very realistic at all. the flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. old style animation would have been much better than this. since hasbro reportedly likes to do things cheap, they got what they paid for. i had trouble watching the whole thing, it was just boring and lacked any soul or gi joe spirit. even the old gi joe commercials would have been better. in fact, the dvd included extras such as four or five current commercials for gi joe spy troops, and those commercials were much more entertaining than the movie. the commercials had more kid-oriented fun and spirit. the commercials were lively, while the movie was dull.
