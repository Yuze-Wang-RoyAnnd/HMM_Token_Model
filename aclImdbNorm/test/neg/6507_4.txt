this (allegedly) based-on-a-true story tv movie concerns a woman on the run from the fbi and a *seriously* stupid guy.<br /><br />first, we have roger paulson (tim matheson), a "regular guy" type with a mind-numbing job, an ex-wife, a kid he hardly ever gets to see and some cats.<br /><br />next, there is "elaine-lisa-you name it" (tracy pollan), a smart, sexy, good looking woman whose tongue would burst into flame if she ever told the truth.<br /><br />roger and lisa meet when she answers a lonely-hearts ad. roger is one of these poor saps who can't seem to handle living alone, so after his wife dumped him, he places his ad.<br /><br />it doesn't take long for roger to figure out that lisa is *not* a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her. he doesn't even have enough sense to change the locks on his apartment door after he throws her out.<br /><br />go ahead and watch this if you don't have anything else to do.<br /><br />
