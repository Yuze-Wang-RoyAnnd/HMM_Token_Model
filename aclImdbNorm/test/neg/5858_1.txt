the people who came up with this are sick and twisted freaks how the hell can you exploit people like this? tricking people into thinking that this is real? which i probably don't doubt that it is... i saw this thing for the very first time today series 7 and it made me sick to my stomach i almost threw up. i just couldn't stop crying my eyes out for these poor people and if that woman really did have that baby you should all be ashamed of yourselves!!!!!!!!!! i have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely appalling that would put a "real" pregnant woman in so much fricken danger! you people are bloody animals and should be locked up for life allowing something like this to put on t.v. if this so called "reallity show" is for real then why isn't anyone being put in prison for allowing people to die and not doing a god damn thing about it. you all deserve to be friggen hunted down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
