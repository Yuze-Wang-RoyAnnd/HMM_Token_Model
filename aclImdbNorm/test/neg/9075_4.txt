i chose this movie because i was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys. as i lived this situation and get lost in it, i hope a similar story would inspire me. <br /><br />my major concerns are: - why (a) & how (b) the triangle forms ? - why (c) & how (d) the triangle degenerates ?<br /><br />(a) the movie offers a plain answer: "because it's better !". <br /><br />(b) here, it's an open triangle: the three share things together. mine was a closed one: every ones knows the others but never the three are together or speak about the missing one: <br /><br />(c) the movie doesn't offer spoken explanations but rather prefer visual & emotional assumptions: the end comes with sensuality, sexuality coming up in the triangle, or more accurately, when for one member, deep feelings are tied with intimacy, and, as for the latter and the former, they can be divided. i agree with that.<br /><br />(d) in the movie & in my story, silence is the proof that something isn't well.. and in a ironic and painful way, the tool for this sad times, is always the phone: i lived this dreadful planned phone-call: "call me back: i wait you"
