of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. even ford. but this is one of his worst. even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a bonanza or big valley. <br /><br />yet there is one moment, typical wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the indian wife of gable. she has gone to give her baby some water and wham is killed by an arrow instantly. no warning. nada. <br /><br />one of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema. particularly after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy western. of course the treatment of her afterwards is laden with wellman's total indifference, apparently, to the film. even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.
