i was recommended this movie by one of my film-making friends, and was therefore expecting something good. sadly, i was very disappointed by the first half -- ah, a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their a**hole boss, how original -- and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45-odd minutes i'd already wasted. but all i got was the 'shock' ending...<br /><br />the basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say, and says whatever it does say (hard to tell what that is) badly. great acting does not save a bad script full of characters i can't care about.<br /><br />now maybe if i didn't moonlight in the movie industry i'd be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen, but as it is my feelings are as summed up above: 'ho hum'.<br /><br />2/10... would have been 1/10 if it weren't for the acting and the paper cut scene.
