i have never seen the tv series or the previous movies. probably that's the reason why i didn't enjoy it much. boring and just not funny, sums it up nicely.<br /><br />considering the budget the movie seemed to have, it's embarrassing they couldn't do an even passable job.<br /><br />we went to the cinema with no exceptions' at all and the hope to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldn't be too taxing on the mind. my friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and i spend the next 2 hours hoping that it would finally pick up. a hope, which died with the end credits.
