free willzyx (stupidest name/title ever) is the worst episode of any of the tv shows i watch, which includes x-files, alias, all 3 law and orders, all of the csi's, family guy, simpsons, chappelle's show, colbert report, and more. south park was for very long my favorite of the comedy shows, because of it's shockingly obscene content and disturbing black comedy. free willzyk has none of the content i mentioned earlier. it was so tame, so unoffensive it might has well been an episode of sesame street. kyle goes to sea world where a few of the workers play a prank on him, making him think a whale is talking to him. he befriends the whale, actually befriends it. hello? this is south park! the same show that brought you "cancelled", "chickenlover", "it hits the fan", "death camp of tolerance", and so many more! not spongebob squarepants! ugh. i actually watched the whole episode, which is 30 minutes of my life i will never get back. anyhow, i was extremely disgusted with this episode and i can't believe the shocking decline in the quality of matt & trey's work.
