there is no way to put into words just how bad, how shapeless, paceless and laughless these "vice academy" films really are. you have to experience one for yourself. for the third time in a row, writer-director rick sloane does not show even an ounce of writing or directing talent. there is nothing here that a person above the age of 5 will believe or laugh at, yet the (very brief) nudity and other "plot" elements make the films unsuitable for kids. which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental capabilities of 5-year-olds. elizabeth kaitan makes a more than welcome replacement for linnea quigley - she is winningly bubbly and cute, and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can make a viewer smile as well. but watching her and the other girls in this film is like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert covered with horse manure.
