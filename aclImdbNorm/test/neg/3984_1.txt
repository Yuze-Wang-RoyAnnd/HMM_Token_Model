'you're in the navy now' is painfully bad: very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made. it's supposedly based on a true story, but the incident which inspired this film doesn't seem to have enough plot to sustain a feature-length script.<br /><br />i saw this movie on local television while i was house-sitting for my mother-in-law in long island, new york. there was a raging blizzard outside, and i was literally snowbound. if i'd been able to get out the door, i definitely would have stopped watching this movie.<br /><br />there are some interesting names in the supporting cast, notably charles bronson (under his original name), lee marvin, harvey lembeck, jack webb and jack warden. forget it. everybody stinks in this movie. even the usually reliable millard mitchell is awful. lee marvin and jack warden are onscreen so briefly, there's no point in your watching for them.<br /><br />gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new, experimental steam turbine: basically, the whole ship is a giant teakettle. cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one: if it were, it would have gone to a better officer.<br /><br />cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply had no ability for comedy. he made several bad comedies, and this one is his worst. jane greer has always bored me, and she bored me more than usual here. this ship went down with all hands, and sank without a trace. have i mentioned that this movie stinks? i'll rate 'you're in the navy now' one point out of 10. toot! toot!
