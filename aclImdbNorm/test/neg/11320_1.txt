never i have seen a movie so terrible that i've gone insane. it was a huge waste of time seeing this crappy film. there are a lot of things i hate about this movie: the songs is so terrible (yet a little bit catchy) i hit my head on the wall(especially from the song 'grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of santa' which i hit 10 times *shrugs*), the character design, and that evil, greedy, and bitchy cousin mel.<br /><br />i cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen. even though i kinda like her southern voice. <br /><br />the only bright-side is that austin bucks is played by the person who is the voice of liquid snake from metal gear solid.<br /><br />i would not recommended to people to watch for the holidays as it was a huge disgrace for x-mas.
