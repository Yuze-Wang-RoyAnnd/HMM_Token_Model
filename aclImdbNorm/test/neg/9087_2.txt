whoever likened this one to raiders of the lost ark certainly knew whereof he spoke. he might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. "kay hoog" reminds one more than a little of both lamont cranston (the shadow) and clark savage (doc savage). (the shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first "dark knight"- was also thought to be one kent allard. if one were to take savage's first name first and add to it the kent, you end up with- voila- clark kent. funny, innit?) like indiana jones, hoog isn't above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more blatant and less "charmingly roguish" than jones's). unfortunately, this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials (from any era) in terms of overall quality. one of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback, quite literally breathing down his neck, simply watch as hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon. why they don't bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films.<br /><br />the second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. granted, this was one of the first ever serials and, as such, should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits, even, to tolerance. (at one point, the capture of the hero is effected not on screen, but in the narration itself! talk about cutting corners...) fritz lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, the spiders is a bitter pill indeed to swallow...
