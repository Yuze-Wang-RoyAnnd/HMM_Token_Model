as much as i love the story of david copperfield, i cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie. it was probably the second worst movie i have ever seen. one problem i see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. it is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. i dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. it was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp. also, i don't think the filmmakers interpreted copperfield's personality correctly. the idea of him strolling around on a beach moaning about his life seems inconsistent with the proactive, forward-thinking nature dickens gave him in the novel. agnes also bothered me. she came across as a ditsy household decoration, rather than a strong woman. dora was perfect, however. this movie was fraught with problems, and i wait eagerly for someone to make a decent screen version.
