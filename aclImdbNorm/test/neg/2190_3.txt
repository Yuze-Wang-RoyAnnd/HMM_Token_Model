los angeles physician tom reed (vincent ventresca) survives a tragic auto accident but ends up going to prison in the high desert of california. when his time is up he lands in a small, wind-swept town named purgatory flats. his first stop is a bar, where he quickly slams a beer and gets hired as a bartender. so much for ex-cons having a tough time finding work. this is the first in a long line of absurdities that make up the plot of writer/director harris done's silly attempt at modern, desert-set, film noir.<br /><br />his first night on the job tom meets a sexy femme fatal named sunny (alexandra holden), who hangs out with a family of bad boys: the mecklins, consisting of uncle dean (gregg henry) and his two nephews, the drug addicted owen (kevin alejandro), who is sunny's husband, and awol soldier randy ("90210"s brian austin greer). after his shift is finished there's a shooting, and dr. tom just happens to be nearby. he agrees to treat one of the wounded and, most importantly, not tell the cops. i'm not sure that's a good move for a guy fresh out of the pen, but this script (co-written by diane fine) has very little to do with logic.<br /><br />tom makes a series of poor decisions that get him further and further entangled with the criminally inclined mecklin boys, including stealing medical supplies and hopping into the sack with sunny. everybody in the theater is screaming, "don't do it! walk away", but tom does it anyway.<br /><br />in a classic film noir like "body heat" or "double indemnity" we root for and empathize with william hurt and fred mcmurray as they get sucked into the web of bright, sexy, devious femme fatals like kathleen turner and barbara stanwyck. it's not their fault. we'd probably be tempted by all that money or that particular dame, too. but dr. tom's weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances. sunny is sexy but not a very compelling character, and there's no money to tempt him. you're left wondering if he attended the same medical school as dr. nick riveria from "the simpsons".<br /><br />the silly script would have you believe that a redneck's rural home has almost everything you need to treat a gunshot to the stomach, and that one so wounded could easily hop to attention and effectively participate in a fist fight. it gives us an implausible car chase with one of those "the club" things clamped to the steering wheel. oh, that oil tanker that just exploded - no one noticed that.<br /><br />i wonder how such a ridiculous script ever got green-lighted? perhaps brian austin greer has more juice than i gave him credit for. it's obvious that he took the relatively small role of randy - a hot-headed murder - to show producers that he had more acting range than he displayed on "90210".<br /><br />it's also sort of sad to see nicholas turturro playing a stereotypical hispanic drug dealer. he deserves better than this.<br /><br />if you have an iq over 50, "purgatory flats" will have you shaking your head in disbelief. i'll give it 3 stars for the unintentional laughs and the scenes with the sexy miss holden running around in her red panties.
