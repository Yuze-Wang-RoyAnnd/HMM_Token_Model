did the first travesty actually make money? this is another sequel (along the lines of another stakeout) that no one asked for. but we've received it anyway. the sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain-dead. it's also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) to think i almost felt sorry for ritter, yasbeck, and warden. did they need the money that much?
