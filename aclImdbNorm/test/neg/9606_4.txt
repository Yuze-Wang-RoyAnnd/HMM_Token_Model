i tried to give this show a chance, but it really doesn't sit well with me. although the performances are good, the writing isn't. the two oldest step-siblings, derek and casey, are equally annoying; i get the impression that we're supposed to side with casey, given that she's the protagonist, but i don't find her at all likable. the parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless. the three younger children are the most watchable things on the show; lizzie and edwin are sweet the way they team up, and marti is adorable. the plot lines are a bit far-fetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow -- blended families are common, yes, but this family isn't really trying all that hard to blend. on the whole, i think it grades thumbs-down.
