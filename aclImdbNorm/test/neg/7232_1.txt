a flesh-eating octopus, where does that guy boaz(what the..?) davidson keep getting inspiration? anyway,even for the low,low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people-genre and me,this one is just beyond awful.the octopus is one of the lamest,laziest,weakest monsters i've ever seen.i think he just ended up in the (ahum)east river because sea world got sick of him.the actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them.bunch of idiots,that way he'll never learn!you guys want all the other giant killer octopuses(that's the correct plural,by the way)to laugh at him?meanies.<br /><br />up to stop the octopus are wind,razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent nick hartfield and his partner,who will retire in a week but first has to be eaten by the octopus.hooray,octopus won the fight!a couple more and he's going to evolve(the scars in my mind stay).nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing(doesn't he have a gun or something?)but no,that magically doesn't help either.<br /><br />okay,enter sea cop's love interest rachel starbird.is this based on some comic book or something?anyway,together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park.they hope this helps,cos it's the 4th of july in a couple of days,and the octopus might join the party.and you don't know what he's like when he's drunk.rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't end while nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops.<br /><br />but all's crappy that ends crappy,nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times,and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh.you know,on tummy-vision,this would probably get an r.in real life,i'd say all ages but i kinda like all ages so my final idea is:suitable for absolutely nobody.there's no sex,no gore,no nothing.now forget this movie ever existed.join the club.
