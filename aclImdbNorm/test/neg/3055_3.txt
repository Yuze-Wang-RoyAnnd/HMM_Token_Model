when i first saw this i thought bits of it were fairly scary. but the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the dozy teenagers are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them. there are some genuinely good moments such as angela's speech about demons, and the briefly-seen demon itself is effective. but this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis. it's all pretty tacky and cheap-looking and often downright silly, pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror. the music is excellent, however, and the epilogue is certainly amusing, but this film doesnt have much to recommend it, just comes across as another jason-type stalk-and-slash fare.
