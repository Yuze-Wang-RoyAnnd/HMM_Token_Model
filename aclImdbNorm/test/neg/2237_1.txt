i went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had already been and loved it. so i came in with a neutral attitude, not really expecting the worst. unfortunately, that is what i got. i could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen. but for your benefit i will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons. to begin, the acting was very good, especially christopher waltz and melanie laurent. there were also a few lines that deserved a laugh, and a couple suspenseful scenes. sadly, good acting, a little humor and suspense is where the good points end. the whole beginning story could have been great. a jewish girl's family is butchered, she goes into hiding, later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge. sounds very good. but the movie wouldn't be quite as "satisfying" for the americans and jews craving nazi blood. i have no problem with wwii movies or killing nazis; i saw defiance and like it very much. however, it's the way and attitude with which our would-be heroes kill. i'll give you a prime example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie oozes. our hoodlum gang ambushes a german unit and kills/scalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). they ask the sergeant to divulge information on another german unit. when he "respectfully refuses" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat, cheering, and swearing as if they were at a football game. they took that nazi's head off yaaayy! now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. here's a hypothetical situation: a group of american soldiers are ambushed and taken captive by the enemy. the same scenario follows and the american commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. the enemy bashes his head in with much celebration. this would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie. that american soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself, and those barbarians brutally murdered him! well
