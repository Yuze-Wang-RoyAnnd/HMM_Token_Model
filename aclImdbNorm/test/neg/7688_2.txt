as a bit of a michael dudikoff fan i sat down to watch one of his good old-fashioned actioners - i'm still waiting.<br /><br />the film is based around a group of us commandos trying to get rid of a bunch of syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor. maddie reese (felicity waterman) was an english member of the commando unit and of course she became romantically involved with tom dickson (dudikoff). i must ask since when have the brits had female sas members - as far as i know if they are ever needed they are got from other sources. even if they did i can pretty much guarantee they wouldn't be as wet as maddie reese. i would also think that tom dickson would be a little more responsible in his position - or have i lost the plot?! i know there is always the romantic angle in these films as it helps provide the feelgood factor, but does it have to be throughout, especially when there's more important things to be taken into consideration - like nuclear warfare!<br /><br />the signing of the treaty on the us aircraft carrier intrigued me. the "sacred pen" as carried by one of the supposed tv news crew - are there were no security checks to find out who or what goes on board one of these ships, especially with the calibre of people that was on it. mind you if there was, i suppose there would be no story.<br /><br />i could go on, but when it got to "inner body bomb defusion" in order to safely remove a bullet i gave up on the action drama movie bit and enjoyed it for the comedy it actually was.<br /><br />by the way, would a news reporter really say "downtown damascus"??
