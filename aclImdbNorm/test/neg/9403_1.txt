this is by far probably the worst film al pacino could have starred in. the movie had no real plot. it kind of careens into 24 different directions. it seems that the target audience for this film are people from gambler's anonymous.mat mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be pacino's prot'eg'e'. so he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service. does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills? it was just plain stupid to think of. the trailer did promise to show us how he makes his sure-shot picks but after going through the whole film i have yet to see what skill if any he ever had. if you want skill try looking at robert de niro's character in casino now that is showmanship. at some point in the film, mat's character picks his winning bets at a flip of a coin. anybody could do that. al pacino seems to talk a lot and i mean blabber mouth in your face dialog. i think that style started with scent of a woman and worked for him because he finally won an oscar but now i think its just irritating. he seems to be always sermonizing. he does do a mean act of portraying a man having unstable angina (that's an impending heart attack) its typically reminiscent of his acting in godather part 3 which he plays the aging,diabetic mafia don corleone but other than that pacino's talent is wasted on this film. rene russo is just plain eye candy for this film. she's kept in shape and shows it off in the tight clothes she wears throughout. this film is plain crap. do not waste your money on it. it is much worse than the gambling picks of mats character in the film.
