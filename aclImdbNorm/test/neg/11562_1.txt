mystery science theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this "gem." <br /><br />this one is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80's porn you could have purchased on vhs from an arcade on 42nd st. before disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down. <br /><br />but, wait - all the sex scenes have been cut. i challenge anyone to find a worse film. this film could replace water-boarding as a humane method of interrogation. <br /><br />no, i take that back - i would prefer water-boarding. <br /><br />the only credit this movie could earn apart from being the worst movie ever made would be to threaten the middle east into solving its problems under pain of having to watch this movie.
