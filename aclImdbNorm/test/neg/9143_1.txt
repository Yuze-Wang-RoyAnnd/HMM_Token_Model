if any movie ever made italians look bad, this is it.<br /><br />duke mitchell - what an a--hole. duke mitchell, i s--t on your grave. seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the ku klux klan or skinheads. awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be all bad, right? wrong. typical softheaded sentimental tripe.<br /><br />while i do understand why some people might be struck by and even, to a certain extent, admire the film's audacious, totally un-pc verve (it's certainly unashamed of its own hatefulness and sense of self-involvement), but this doesn't change the fact that the main character, mimi (and, by extension, duke mitchell), is thoroughly loathsome human being who earns not one iota of empathy or interest, especially given that duke mitchell is such a complete bore as a performer. but what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame (apart from this dog t--d of a movie) was being a second rate dean martin imitator?
