bad, bad, and did i mention bad? aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the movie was when surveyors are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left, but you can clearly see by their shadows, and the bright sky, that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. talk about consistency. read the script director!<br /><br />the only cool part of this movie, besides the rack on clara bryant of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton horse that the bone eater rides on. that thing was pretty cool as it chased the surveyors on their motorcycles.
