i do not know what today's movie goers expect, but after 68 years of movie watching.. (well maybe i didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make that 58 years of movie watching) i expect to be entertained, not bored to tears, assaulted by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled. surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have no imagination, little if any talent, a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on, long after the purpose for it has elapsed. that anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie, when it is nothing more that hollywood garbage is beyond me. as a combat veteran i have seen violence, blood and gore, in many forms, and movies like we were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get, but it has redeeming value. surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor, with no writing ability, no directorial training, no experience in film editing, and a total lack of contact with reality. just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as fbi agents, setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops, etc.. a high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like...
