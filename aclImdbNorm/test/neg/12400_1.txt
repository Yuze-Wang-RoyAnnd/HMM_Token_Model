dire beyond belief. obviously set on the isle of man masquerading as the us - very badly - and full of cut-rate british actors who can't do american accents. a monster that looks like an unarticulated promotional cut-out for alien from a movie store, with the most inflexible feet ever seen. girls in the shower, undressing, catfighting, blah, blah, blah. you get the idea. don't watch it, run away, hide, avoid.
