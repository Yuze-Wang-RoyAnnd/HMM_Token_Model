the screen writers for this mini-series should have been sentenced to the guillotine themselves. they butchered a very fun story and squandered the talents of richard e. grant. the only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. all of the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same. i strongly suggest watching another version of the scarlet pimpernel. any other version is better than this one.
