oh, man, i hated this movie. granted, the site locations were great, but that's about the only positive thing i can say about it. now, i'm going to state right at the beginning that i am very critical of the way weapons, especially firearms, are both portrayed, and handled, in movies. being a war flick, portrayal was fine, but the shoddy weapons handling in the movie would have never been tolerated by a real seal team. the acting was more wooden than my first sailboat, the equipment carried (or lack of it) was laughable, and the dialogue was, shall we say, lacking in anything interesting. well, with the exception of the journalist, which was actually prescient. watching this movie was comparable to watching "palmetto" with woody harrelson, where each scene was so bad you just couldn't turn it off, because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. like palmetto, they certainly did. the scene in the water, where, after shooting the first of the enemy, they blow the damn boat up, thereby having to face possible drowning, made me laugh so hard, that for a millisecond, i almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for. then charlie sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy down to the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the many camera cuts, it looked like they went down about 80 feet. nice continuity there....) before slashing his throat was so damn stupid, i was stunned. then again, so was the whole damn movie. i enjoy action movies, but not this one. note: the version i watched was a tv version, pan & scan. i can't imagine that made a difference, except for making the whole thing blessedly shorter!
