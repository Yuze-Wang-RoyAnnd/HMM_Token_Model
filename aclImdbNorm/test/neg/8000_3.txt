enter the ninja (1981) was the first of several "ninja" films produced by cannon starring or co-starring japanese sensation sho kosugi. but the star of the first "ninja" film was legendary tough guy franco nero. sadly not even mr. nero or sho kosugi couldn't make this film watchable. when you have two bad dudes in an action film and it's neither watchable or fun, somethings amiss. but i digress. skip this chapter and watch the next films in the series. they're more interesting and a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />next is revenge of the ninja. instead of playing the "evil oriental" (i use that term tongue in cheek mind you). he's the star! strange for a western film. watch that one instead.<br /><br />not recommended except for die hard sho kosugi fans or cannon film buffs.
