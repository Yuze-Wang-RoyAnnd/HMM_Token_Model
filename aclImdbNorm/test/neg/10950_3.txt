after watching this movie on a boring saturday afternoon, i couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it. it wasn't "heartwarming" or "clever"; it was merely an amalgam of every other "mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other" movie ever made.<br /><br />the characters are a stereotype bouillabaisse -- we have the blacks, the hispanics, the jews, the asians, and the homosexuals -- and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do. the black mother declares that it's "all right, then" when it's mentioned that another black character is at church instead of helping prepare dinner (because all blacks love church), the hispanics seem only capable of speaking spanish when the greet each other or make exclamations, the lesbians do nothing but cuddle and kiss (and one of them wears a bandanna. because all lesbians dress like ani difranco), and the vietnamese family owns a video store. in l.a. imagine that.<br /><br />oh, and the movie is called "what's cooking" because each ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think thanksgiving dinner should be! the black mother wants cornbread and macaroni and cheese, the hispanics are shown rolling tortillas, the vietnamese family is deep frying spring rolls; i'm surprised there wasn't a bottle of manischewitz on the jewish table. this is all shown via the time-honored tradition of the "musical-montage", where they play the surfari's "wipeout", rapidly switching the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures. isn't that cute? anyway, once the director is finished establishing how different everyone is, he attempts to show the inner humanity that we, as all people of every race, religion and culture share, by inventing implausible and overly dramatic conflicts for each of the families to deal with. it would be a plot-killer to mention what each of these conflicts are, but rest assured that they are indeed surprises, that is if you have been sleeping for the first half of the movie. the theme of "disgracing the family" runs pretty strong throughout.<br /><br />all in all, if you're the type of person who enjoys those new-fangled movies that revolve around the stories of unlikely characters intertwining, well, you still won't like this movie. if you like extended montages of food being passed around a table, then you need to put this in your netflix queue. but if stereotypes and clich'es are endearing to you, then make sure you ask for this for christmas. or hanukkah. or kwanzaa.
