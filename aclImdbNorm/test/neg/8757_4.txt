well, i didn't know what to expect from 555. matter of fact, i had never even heard of it until a few months ago. but, being a collector of just about all types of horror i figured i would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.<br /><br />basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. what the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. he decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death. after this, he proceeds to rape the dead corpse. the police think they have a lead on the killings but really have no idea what is going on. how will they find the killer? does anybody care?<br /><br />this movie is filled with some of the worst actors i have ever seen. no wonder none of these actors went on to do anything else, literally. the three lead actors consist of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. i am being sarcastic when i say sexy, she is about as un-sexy as it gets. the two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle dum. one of them underacts his part and the other one may have gone to the shatner school of acting. the acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie, thus almost putting you to sleep.<br /><br />the only thing holding this terrible movie together is a few decent gore scenes. for a movie on this budget the makers must have put all of there money into the special effects, which still aren't that great.<br /><br />unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie out there, i would suggest steering clear of this movie. 4/10
