i think homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie - more like "plantation grown" - but it doesn't have quite the same ring to it. my guide described it a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh. more in the genre of the farcical thriller/drama. the characters developed well enough - an all-star cast made it oh-so promising, just a shame the plot was patently absurd. ted danson provided a fine cameo as did jamie lee curtis in her walk-on part. jon bon jovi has this amazing ability to measure thc content in the front seat of his car! i guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one - not for the gun shy paranoid types though.
