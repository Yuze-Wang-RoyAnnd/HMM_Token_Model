yes, lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid. and this soap opera ain't kidding when they make perry king, supposedly a well renowned medical doctor, unable to see the evil surrounding him. puts your trust in doctors, huh? how can anyone not see what's going on? is he that stupid? and the evil wife, with a face like a horse, goes around killing off his entire family without a trace. how does she acquire all the drugs? that isn't explained. how does she get off being a secretary in a hospital without any credentials? i guess the director, don fauntleroy asks us to just believe it. i didn't. i kept yelling at the screen at the stupidity of king with all right in front of his face. if the wife was that attractive, maybe, just maybe, i'd accept it. but she's not even that. shannon sturges is the perfect wife and i tell you she has the face of a horse. i wouldn't cross the street for her, yet our perfect husband does and quickly. after everybody in the cast get knocked off, i wasn't satisfied with the come up pence given to our villainess. she deserved more than she got. william moses plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately you know his outcome from day one. pleasure to at least see one pretty face in this clinker. that of lesley anne down. she gives the film a 2 count just on the relief of seeing someone fetching in this mess. perry king deserved his fate. what a jerk.
