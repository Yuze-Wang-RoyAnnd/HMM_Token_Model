yes this movie is obviously trying to be a conan the barbarian, and what amazes me is that this is a sequel (the people demanded another one?). the first part of the flick is a flashback showing the original. from what i saw it doesn't look worth checking out (and apparently ator always kills a huge puppet in his movies). well now ator lives at the ends of the earth with his mute sidekick thong. a girl seeks his help as this evil dude has her father in his custody. let me just say this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the villian and just prattles on endlessly. the bad guy waits to the very end of the movie and finally smacks the old guy around leaving you to wonder "what took him so long to snap?". meanwhile, ator and his sidekick and the gal go through one adventure after another. they fight cavemen, invisible soldiers (don't ask), rent a thugs, and people who worship snakes. ator also battles a giant snake puppet and hang-glides (again, don't ask). all the while you will be thinking that conan would kick ator's butt.
