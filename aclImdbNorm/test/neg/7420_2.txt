developing movies that are based on actual events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. you have to mainly reconcile reported testimonies, conflicting info sources, and hollywood creativity to produce something the audience can get into. unfortunately, for sasquatch, none of these things seem to take place.<br /><br />the movie starts out in typical film noir when a research team crash lands somewhere in the cascades via airplane. from there the research team disappears, and despite attempts from law enforcement officials and local rescue parties they remain missing for some time. while one of the passengers is walking, infra-red-like images are splashed on the screen (a la predator) which subtly hint that the legendary sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fates.<br /><br />cue harlan knowles (henriksen), ceo of biocomp industries and father of one of the crash victims. knowles puts together his own search & rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research crew, along with the invaluable technology lost during the crash.<br /><br />after knowles' tailor-made rescue team is put together, the entire movie traverses down the path of uncolorful characters, dizzying cinematography, and a totally unoriginal plot line. i literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it attempted to frighten me out of my wits. the only member of the cast that held his own was henriksen, which doesn't make up for the lack of depth presented in all of the other characters. the over-done sound effects were annoying as well; basically, i didn't know if i was watching a movie about bigfoot or grizzly bears.<br /><br />neither was the plot line all that great. it was too underdeveloped as the viewer is mainly subjected to typical fright music found in anything similar of the genre. obviously you didn't have to be a genius to figure out who would be pulling off all their clothes by the middle of the movie, or who'd be the first unlucky soul to get mauled by mr. sasquatch. as far as good points, there are none, and therefore i gave this movie a 2 out of 10.
