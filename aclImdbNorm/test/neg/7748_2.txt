this movie had a very convoluted plot and very contrived setting, that i, frankly, could not follow, which is surprising considering the acting and dialogue could have only been the product of a kindergartener's writing. if you like kathy ireland, then maybe you'd want to see this. the movie was probably made as a vehicle to try to get her into hollywood, but if that was its goal i would have to say that i hope she didn't invest too much money in its production.
