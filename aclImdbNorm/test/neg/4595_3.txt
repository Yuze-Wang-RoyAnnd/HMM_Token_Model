i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely, i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story. while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors. 1. speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie. in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. 2. the asian nurse who survived speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie. this would have been impossible. in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims. 3. the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them. not true. in reality speck was at first calm and gentle, reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them. this is how he was able to tie each of them up. 4. the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be. fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80's and said that speck not only did'nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why. speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie. if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying, the voice over would be laughable. all in all, doug cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold-blooded even though i don't think the real speck was so forward in his violence. no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known, after all, for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them. beverly ann sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film. she is a very good actress. if you are at all squeamish, do not see this film. it's very graphic and disturbing.
