this film could of been a hell of a lot better if they didn't use brian conley as a gangster and if they didn't start the film with christopher biggins.<br /><br />when i watched this film i had absolutely no idea what was going on. there were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film believable. the film deserves a 0, but seeing as i there isn't a 0 i gave it a 1.<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy, i would rather poke out my eyeballs with some rusty scissors than watch this film again. i'm telling you, that was an hour and a half of my life i won't get back.<br /><br />if you want to watch a gangster film, don't get this. watch "going off big time" or "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" instead.
