sorry if i disappoint anyone about what i am about to say to this made for tv movie. but, i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster. the directing is really awfully bad. but, after i looked up its information here, i realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing. maybe they don't have budget, but anyway, ang lee's sense and sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit. the director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldn't even keep up a rational continuity in itself. it keeps pulling me outta scenes. maybe someone need to work hard on story line/ board. the dubbed sound is also awfully bad. my god.... normally, i would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual. but, this time i am just mad , "i really wanna hit something hard." ...just don't do the job if someone can't fulfill it to its best. bad arts (its' not even art, what is it? )really hurt people.
