i found code 46 very disappointing. i thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didn't deliver. code 46 lacked thought and structure and the storyline didn't flow well. i thought that tim robbins character wasn't well developed, for eg. i thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was. when they were first in violation of a code 46 it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been genetically linked but all the technology was available to them, he took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud. i constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story line to develop and yet it never did. i felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating but turned out to be the opposite. code 46 tried to be too clever and in the end just ended up lacking imagination.i would not recommend this film to anybody, the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively short.
