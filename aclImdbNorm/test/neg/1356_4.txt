insane really. even if you haven't seen the original george cukor movie with norma shearer, joan crawford, rosalind russell, paulette goddard, joan fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. depressing for many different reasons. meg ryan for one. what has she done to herself? her face can hardly move. that alone puts her miles away from norma shearer. annette bening should be suing the dp and debra messing, what the hell was she doing here? actresses with no connection in the public's subconscious trying to pass for friends, totally unconvincingly. eva mendes in the joan crawford part is an outrageous piece of miscasting. what a terrible idea! her character is like a trans-gender performer without any taste or subtlety. bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women.the only positive things i can mention are a short but very funny appearance by bette midler and cloris leachman as the housekeeper.
