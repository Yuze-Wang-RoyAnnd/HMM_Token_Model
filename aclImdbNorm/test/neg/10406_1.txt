and obviously i didn't see it! <br /><br />but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead, i know now to avoid this like the plague! i hate it when hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?<br /><br />and i can't believe that someone like louis gossett, jr. would return for something like that.<br /><br />did jason gedrick really decline this? well, i hate to say it, but even if he took the role again, it would have still had that same continuity error. i bet (if he really turned it down), he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film.<br /><br />i'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel, but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd!
