on the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics, particularly concerned with himmler, the ss and their research branch. it also has some good piano music, some interesting footage and some excellent camera work.<br /><br />however it is a very poor piece of historical work. it has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows.<br /><br />himmler set up a department in the ss for research into the origins of the german race. they went all over the world. they did some things and launched expeditions to all manner of places... (nonoe of these avenues were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). they wanted to establish that the aryan race and the german people were one and the same thing through historical proof. they didn't find any. the members of this research group were leading professors, members of the ss and therefore linked to the holocaust, and were seen as ok after the war and went on to lead german institutes.<br /><br />these facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either condemns these people or exonerates them. nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme, the aim of the program is unclear, it hops from topic to topic. the witnesses, though presented as credible, are few and unsupported.<br /><br />sadly this programme does not know where it is going or why and fails to impress. the topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on. i would avoid this.<br /><br />also the 'holy grail'is the german bloodline, nothing to do with the holy grail of christian mythology except in passing. mentions of expeditions to look for the christian holy grail are made but never followed through. the title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and incomplete.
