this movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were wrongly done. the main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie.<br /><br />1) boobie miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a preseason game at texas tech. this means he won't get anything done during the season at all and chris comer comes up sooner on the team.<br /><br />2) the game against marshall was lost at marshall. the team depicted as marshall was actually midland high one of permian's main rivals and here is the proof- marshall high is the mavericks colored scarlet and silver, midland high is the bulldogs colored purple and gold. look at the jerseys and you will see who it is. also the real marshall high's football roster is overwhelmingly black, the team shown was racially mixed like midland high. <br /><br />3) permian only loses to midland lee by one point in district play. midland lee loses to midland high and midland high loses to permian. these are the teams that set up the coin toss as such.<br /><br />4) boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to chris comer and after not getting any playing time in the midland lee game, he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again. <br /><br />5) brian chavez was a tight end and defensive end who wore #85 not a tight end and strong safety. in addition, boobie wore #35 and ivory christian wore #62. <br /><br />6) the coaches end up liking chris comer as a player more than boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too, this is in part why boobie quits the team. <br /><br />7) dallas carter is played in austin at darrell k. royal memorial stadium where ut plays in the state semi-finals not the state finals. carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an ineligible player.<br /><br />the acting is done pretty well but if you read the book, you will see these flaws are pretty true. i am also tired of hearing all the pc hypocrites out there complain about the depiction of dallas carter's football team. the team according to the book is as large, monstrous, talented, and black as the movie shows. people say it is a racist depiction but reading the book, you see a true depiction of the team. the story is very altered giving this movie a score of 3.5/10.
