hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, contrived, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). minor spoilers follow...<br /><br />this movie has huge logic holes - more than any bruckheimer/bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that exemplify the indulgence of hollywood exaggeration. it's a slick hollywood production designed to cash in on hannibal lector mania, directed by "so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously" hack director ridley scott and produced by a hack italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is "doesn't matter whether film is s**t, money is good".<br /><br />i can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters david mamet and steven zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned-hack-author thomas harris. david and steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks. another factor in the disappointment of this film.<br /><br />there are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e.g. starling/pazzi cell-phone in the midst of lecter pursuit that turns up inspector pazzi as the victim. not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by tony hopkins with a smirk and julianne moore, ray liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face. hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" along with hammy acting by gary oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against lecter.<br /><br />the gore effect is good, but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from hannibal. the predecessor - silence of the lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. suspense is what made silence of the lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and tensely directed. the "brain dinner" sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self-parody.<br /><br />the ending is kinda blatant and idiotic - are we supposed to believe that lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you? ooh, scary... <br /><br />
