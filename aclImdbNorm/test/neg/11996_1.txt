when a group of dumb kids (including an unlikable. racist bitch) stay at an old house, it awakens four murderous toltec spirits. can lash la rue save the day? will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display.<br /><br />"the dark power" is the kind of really bad horror/comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly. thing is, they didn't. release this. that doesn't excuse the whole thing, as it has a dreadful synthesizer score (including bad attempts at native american music and even worse "comedy" music), bad make up effects (basically halloween masks), and atrocious acting (ok, the fat guy was alright, though everyone else is terrible, and la rue, a western movie vet, seems embarrassed to be there-not that i blame him really.)<br /><br />the worst thing though, is the comedy aspects. sure, dumb teens is one thing, but when the movie keeps talking about the toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil, only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying, bumbling fools, all hope is dashed. combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill. there is no skill on display here, as it all is just stupid, and not "so dumb it's fun" either. i mean "smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock aren't i dumb" dumb.<br /><br />not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster. terrible movie, and not even worth a rental.
