this might very well be the worst movie i've seen in my life. normally i don't watch movies like this, however i was forced to watch this at school. what a torment!<br /><br />the story is as average and boring as it can be: boy meets girl at the spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love. at the end of the movie the film becomes some kind of weird kung-fu movie were the guys in white fight the guys in black. awful!<br /><br />the action is so bad that it makes you laugh. the dances in the film that i think are supposed to be cool are so simple and laughable that even i can do them! and georgina verbaan is possibly the most irritating person i've ever seen on screen.<br /><br />johan nijenhuis is on his way of becoming the dutch ed wood. his movies are so bad that they make you laugh.<br /><br />victor l"ow however gives a surprising good performance and daan schuurmans also acts ok.<br /><br />so please for your own sake don't watch this movie. however if you like watching soaps this might be very well worth your time.<br /><br />yuk!<br /><br />2/10
