this movie features a pretty decent fx sequence of an earthquake for 1936. the reason you haven't seen it, is because audiences in the 30s were enamored of the "jeanette macdonald picture;" in which the eponymous star warbled her way through countless songs, while plots came to a complete standstill. the fx cross time very well. macdonald's songs do not, and the awkward insertion of said songs to show off her only typical talent is not good. <br /><br />the hoary device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a hoodlum is given another run through the machinery (manhattan melodrama, the departed). at the 30 minute mark, you've already heard the song 'san francisco' three times. entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation. only grand hotel from the decade foregoes annoyance to the degree shown in san francisco, dinner at 8, little caesar, stagecoach, all quiet on the western front, les miserables etc..
