possibly the worst film within the genre in existence. it was announced as a comedy, but is simply tragically pathetic. i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to. it is toilet humour at its very poorest, i would avoid even watching the trailer. i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python, you are bound to love this. whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged. i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement. rarely do i leave the cinema, really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me: this one did it in just 30 minutes.
