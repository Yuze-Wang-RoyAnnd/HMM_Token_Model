i saw this film at our crossroads film festival, and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black. i was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they endeavored to portray. how did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? which of the two were f***ing the girl under the tree? it was unclear. and, there seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, "this must be how they sound, just soften the "r"" approach to dialogue, so many times the actors lapse out of it altogether. aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during "emotional" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. walt goggins' character was supposed to have been from morgan city, louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. the other bothersome point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. before i start a firestorm here and am accused of homophobia, i've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably "punks" "when love comes" and "b monkey". but this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. well, tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it. so, i wonder, if the coen brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in minnesota and in mississippi, why can't anyone else? what a waste of my time.
