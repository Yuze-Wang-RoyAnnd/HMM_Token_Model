good grief.. to think i've seen it all.. danny thomas looks so out of place in this mishmash. he seems really uncomfortable. he can't sing worth a lick, and when he's paired up with peggy lee (peggy lee???) she easily.. easily outsings him! maybe the director saw this and made him do the reall really bad comedy routines that he sometimes does in the film. peggy lee is okay, but the whole thing is a shambles. good for a laugh, maybe.
