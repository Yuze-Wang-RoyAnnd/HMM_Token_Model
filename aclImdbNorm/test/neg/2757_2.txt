this could have been so much better than it turned out. tom pittman gives a good performance and some of the older actors do well with what they have to work with, but it just doesn't work.<br /><br />first, the actors are much too old to play high school students, especially howard veit (vince). he looks about thirty. second, it's hard to sympathize with poor marv, especially since betty is not all that hot, to start with.<br /><br />*******spoilers****** the ending is so strange. it looks like the director intended for pittman's character to get shot, but there are no gunshots...he's just knocked to the cement, where he lays there until the ambulance drivers pick him up and place him on a stretcher (face down!). what were his injuries? a skinned knee? goofy! vince has just shot his girlfriend dead without any remorse whatsoever, yet he simply shoves marv to the ground and rushes off, despite the fact that he makes no secret of the fact that he hates the kid. and to make matters even sillier, marv begs the police to tell his father he's sorry. (duh! hey marv. you just got knocked around. i think you will have plenty of opportunities to tell your father you're sorry...in person). and this writer didn't get an oscar nomination? skip it, unless you get to watch it on mst.
