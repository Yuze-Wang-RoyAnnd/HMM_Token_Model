this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen. this is slow, plot less and boring. the cinematographer deserved to be shot. there were various aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was jared being oddly camp. raised many laughs but also many yawns. don't watch with anyone, anytime any place. if u hate someone, recommend they buy or rent this. big waste of time and money. thanks gus van sant...not. i cant think of anything else to say except don't ever see this movie, it will make u want to jump off a cliff. hope gus and his mates read this comment before it's too late and he makes a sequel or some other catastrophe with what appeared to be shot with a camera phone.
