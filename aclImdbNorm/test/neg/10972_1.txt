i can only think of one reason this movie was released. to capitalize off the upcoming fame of guy pearce. this movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes errol flynn's memory. the homosexual encounter was pure speculation. the disdain shown for flynn in this movie is palpable. an easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. horrible and embarrassing. very disappointing. don't waste your time on this utter trash. watch my wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. this movie is not the way.
