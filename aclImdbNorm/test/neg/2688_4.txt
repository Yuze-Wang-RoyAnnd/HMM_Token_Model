this movie is truly amazing,over the years i have acquired a taste for japanese monster movies and am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor. however this one reaches a new low, as it follows the adventures of johnny sokko(?), a young boy who controls a giant robot, and his fight against the evil gargoyle gang, who seem to have an endless supply of horrid giant monsters at their disposal.
