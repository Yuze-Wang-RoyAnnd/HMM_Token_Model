this film has possibly, the worst title for a stooge short ever dreamed up. somewhat fitting, given the actual fifteen minute content.<br /><br />i can do without any of the "shemp a.d." stuff, but i will admit to having a few lol moments from the two-man comedy offered by moe and larry in some of the new footage (and kudos to those guys for trying to give it their all, considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs).<br /><br />another bright spot to this and the last a.d. debacle "commotion on the ocean" is the decided lack of screen time for joe palma and the back of his head. no attempts to have him speak or flap his arms like a chicken(see "hot stuff"), may be worth an extra rating point.<br /><br />2/10
