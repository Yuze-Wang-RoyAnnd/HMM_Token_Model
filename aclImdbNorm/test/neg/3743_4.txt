the fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame, but back in the 1940s, that was about the only type of film made for theaters catering to black audiences due to segregation. so, while mgm, warner and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films, tiny studios with shoestring budgets were left to muddle by with what they had. and from seeing this movie, it's obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film, even if it is a pretty lousy film aesthetically speaking. some of the actors weren't particularly good (especially the french guy), the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly but the film also had some good music--of varying styles from classical to jazz to rhythm and blues. this is thanks to many talented but pretty much unrecognized black performers.<br /><br />now as for the plot, it was totally stupid and silly but still watchable in a kitschy way. i loved seeing tim moore ("kingfish" from the amos 'n andy tv show) in drag, as he made the absolute ugliest woman in cinema history (this includes the bride of frankenstein and many others)--this is probably due to the fact that when not in drag, he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. if the man pretending to be a woman actually looked remotely like a woman, i doubt this movie would have worked as well. seeing this ugly and rubber-faced man with a cheesy wig still being ardently sought after by three suitors was pretty funny.<br /><br />this isn't a great film but from a historical point of view, it's fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what america was like for blacks in this era. a very interesting and funny time capsule.
