...un-funny and un-entertaining, possibly the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to watch. think 'ernest goes to..' humour done even worse. myself and my girlfriend sat through it just to see if it could be as consistently dire as it seems in the opening sequence... yes it is. avoid at all costs.
