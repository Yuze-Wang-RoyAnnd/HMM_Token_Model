this is awful, you just could't believe it. the score is annoying, the filming is bad, for example, sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on some actors faces. the quality of the movie is ultra bad, seems like it was made in the 20ies. it's terrible. there is a bit of blood in the beginning and through the movie but always too dark filmed. no gore no effects. the director made some better one like blood rites. but out there there is a following of the man, 'cause searching to find this cheap flick isn't that hard but you have to pay hard earned cash for it. surely this will get in my top ten of worst horrormovies ever, i don't know if i would call it horror. there is too much talking, you will get bloodthirsty after watching it
