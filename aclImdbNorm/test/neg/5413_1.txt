wow, where to begin with this one. well, if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers, then this one is for you. i bought this movie for 5 bucks because i never pass up an opportunity to laugh at b-movie god casper van dien's blunders, and boy was this one of them. it may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever. this thing, which is supposed to be an indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on halloween. he dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped bonnet over his head. at some points this is a man in costume, at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse. this monster has the uncanny ability to see with "predator" vision, a clear rip-off, and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear. sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes it doesn't. this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow. wow, this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of "critters." this creature is impervious to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. at the end of his killing spree, which we never really find out why he is on, he gets blown up. this is an incredible feat, for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film. but, i guess this last time was the charm. <br /><br />and don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. first of all, what delta force unit employs women? last i checked the military still disallows women into combat situations. also, this unit is "undercover." why? what possible reason would they have to be undercover? and they're not even good at it, i guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms, but they were all carrying machine guns (which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film, at some points sounding like air rifle bb guns, and at others, canons). there is one part when the skeleton man throws some construction workers from a catwalk, and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto. at another point. michael rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground. they tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline, but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. then when he is helped back up the hill, the rope is flat, and when it shows the woman at the "top" of the "hill" the rope goes upward from her grip, not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill. rooker actually has a line that says, "i'm not going after him, i going after it." what? that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard, and i watch these bad movies as a hobby. the saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing/production of this film thought that it was so bad-ass. believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialog, this is good. <br /><br />the acting, bad. the makeup, really bad. these characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face. maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face. yeah, i think i'll make a movie about that, "attack of the alien scars that move around on your face." that villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man, and the film would probably be scarier.
