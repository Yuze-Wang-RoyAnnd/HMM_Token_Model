this movie is probably one of 3 worst movies made in history. i rented this by chance, without reading reviews, and wow, do i regret it. really has no plot, doesn't really follow the vampire genre. just plain god awful. watching this movie will taint your enthusiasm for vampire movies. i felt like the writer/director/producer went on this drug binge and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it on film. whole time i wanted the movie to end.. but the ending was even more whacked. <br /><br />if this review can save just one person from watching this crap, i felt my time spent on registration and writing this review was well worth it.
