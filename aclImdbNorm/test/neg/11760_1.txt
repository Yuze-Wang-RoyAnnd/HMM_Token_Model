you can't really blame the movie maker for glorifying che because the industry is all about money. most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist cuban government after che's death. che was a murdering scumbag from day one. here's a list of the great things che did for cuba 1) executed thousands of innocent cuban men, women, and children to satisfy his lust for power.<br /><br />2) destroyed cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. the cuban peso used to be equal with the american dollar. now it's basically worthless.<br /><br />3) continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy, economy, and the military. he never made it past his first year in medical school, and he was only in one real battle, in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun.<br /><br />4) he took over the largest estate in cuba to set up for himself. he had a yacht, a 60" custom made tv from america, a swimming pool, and a view of the ocean. so much for shunning the materialist life style.<br /><br />cuba today is an absolutely destitute country, and you have no one but che and the castro brothers to thank for it. if you go to cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas. if you did manage to get out of what you're meant to see, you would find slums, beggars, and prostitutes.<br /><br />if you think any of what i'm saying is untrue then go do some studying. compare cuban exports from 1950/60 to those of today; talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called cuban "revolution" of the 1960's; read all of the reports of murdered innocents; read the reports from people who served under che and castro and fled because of what an evil, disgusting human being he was.<br /><br />and please, please, always remember to read or watch everything objectively. stop taking everything at face value and think about it.
