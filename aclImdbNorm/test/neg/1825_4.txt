i watched this basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have third reich references in it. it turned out a pretty brainless and predictable slasher film that appeared to be made to appeal to feminists or something.<br /><br />let me tell you something, if you wait an entire movie to see the attractive female lead's breasts, the last thing you want is a "tastefully" done sex scene with annoying camera angles that don't show anything. her busty friend didn't get hers out either, but we saw plenty of men's butts and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off. and at the end you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel thrusts and swings of the villain (who turns out to be the hunk, funnily enough) and she easily out fights him (uh huh) while her male love interest is tied down and waiting to be rescued. the funniest part was when she picks up a chair and "swings" it at the guy and it breaks over him. now it'd be about as much as she could manage to lift the chair let alone smash it against a person with enough force to break it! it looks ridiculous, she basically brushes it against him and it falls apart. if you are going to do this sort of "role reversal" rubbish (which has already been done to death) then you have to at least make it semi plausible.<br /><br />there was one good bit though. the bad guy did get the better of her slutty friend, teaching her a lesson for being such a tramp and sleeping around. that's not exactly something feminists would like.<br /><br />pretty stupid really. not that american slasher flicks are generally much better, but you have to wonder why they bothered. it brought nothing new to the genre at all.<br /><br />5/10
