i live in rome where the turkish director of this film lives and works. from my italian friends i have heard many good things about his films...so after seeing the preview i really wanted to see "cuore sacro". i am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly improbable and naive films. i love film but this one is really heavy and bad. the main character is really crazy, and should be locked up in a madhouse...made me sympathise with the negative character of an aunt, who runs a dirty-dealing company that only wants to make money...and i consider myself an anti-capitalist...that bad!!!
