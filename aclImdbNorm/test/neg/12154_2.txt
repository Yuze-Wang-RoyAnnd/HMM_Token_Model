i'm really amazed that this got an 88% on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars. the 7.3 rating on imdb... that's not so much of a surprise, seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently. i just can't get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted, and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. which, it turns out, actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of genghis khan. the far-fetched and over-dramatized mongol often echoes the likes of 300, a film that couldn't be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, mongol takes itself seriously. it's stoic seriousness, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies, is what makes it truly the most boring film i've seen this year; possibly the most action or biopic movie i've ever seen. the characters were pathetically written. honestly, i doubt genghis khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film. which is funny to me, because if there's anything that i'd think should be changed for the sake of theatricality, it's making a boring person into an interesting person. the romance between khan and borte is similarly boring, simple, and stupid. also, without giving anything away, mongol contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time- where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development, the film just skips forward without any explanation. it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing. (did i mention how seriously mongol takes itself?) meanwhile, it drags like no film i've ever seen before. even now, i could swear it was three hours long. about 45 minutes into it, i checked the time, being pretty certain that it was almost finished. besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from asano (naturally), mongol is honestly just a disaster. it completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me in anyway. i would never give this film a second chance. and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever, but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day. at least then i know what i'm getting, unlike with mongol, where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeing.<br /><br />the saddest thing about how much i hated mongol is that i have friends who i know, without a doubt, would simply love it.
