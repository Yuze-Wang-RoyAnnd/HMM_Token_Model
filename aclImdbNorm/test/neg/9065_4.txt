ok so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever. there is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even any real characters. you see three people in the entire movie (that are alive) and two are just there for very little reason. the main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. that is the entire movie. i love to see very gory movies, especially since in america real gore just isn't very common in modern movies. so yeah the gore effects were pretty cool. but it just isn't really disturbing. why does everyone think it's so disturbing? there are no characters at all, there are just 3 living people and 3 corpses. no one has any personality or back story. you see three corpses being hacked apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with death itself and how this could very well happen (despite the guy losing his job and going to jail very shortly after.) to be disturbing the viewer has to care and to care they have to identify with the victim. for example in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character. here it's just a guy and a corpse. it's as deep as a puddle made from only a single rain drop. they never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie. all it is a guy hacking up a few bodies, then he has sex with a body. now with the sex scene here is an odd thing about it, he makes sure to wear gloves but doesn't use a condom. so he couldn't care less about catching some weird std from having sex with a corpse but as long as his hands don't get messy there is no problem, now that is really logical. i don't really dislike the movie, i liked that it was very gory but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again, no reason to even care, and it just isn't a very compelling movie. i say if you can find it for under 10 dollars then you might as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it.
