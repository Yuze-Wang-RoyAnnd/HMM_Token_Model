this film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc.<br /><br />i couldn't say the acting was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces by hamilton and sheen - but then i really wouldn't have to. <br /><br />risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains. still, if my life was flashing before my eyes, i think i would fast forward this 90 minutes.<br /><br />i have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published. yes, very resistant suit that sheen wears. i made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again.
