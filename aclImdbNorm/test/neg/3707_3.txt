bill rebane's "the capture of bigfoot" is one of the most awful horror movies ever made.a greedy sawmill owner harvey olsen(richard kennedy)decides that he wants bigfoot captured at all costs.however local game ranger dave garrett(stafford morgan)learns that the bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a geological expedition,and sets out to protect the creature.there is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap.the film is extremely dull and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects.no gore,no suspense-just gigantic boredom.avoid this horrible junk like the plague.
