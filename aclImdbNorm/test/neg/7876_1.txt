i had to watch this movie for professional reasons and can only say it's a complete waste of time. when running, baldwin looks like an ape, characters are dull, same story has been told 1000 times better in other movies. i think everything has been now said about this film, but imdb requires me to write 10 lines. so:boring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivialboring and trivial
