am a hardcore horror/thriller fan...when i was searchin for good horror flick to scare me on my weekend night..grabbed hatchet..with impressing blood stained hatchet movie poster added to average ratings in imdb..but i was wrong after watchin this crap...no characterisation..sick dialogues,with sexy babes bared boobs. i got the feel of watchin porno certainly..and the substory which so called main theme or suspense of the story sucks big time....and here comes the clown wearin funny mask to scare..think users rated this movie went nuts ..it deserves 1 out of 10 i give 2 for bare boobs babes n soundtrack it has...
