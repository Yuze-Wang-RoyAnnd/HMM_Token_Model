maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with aids. but really people, the maniacal laughter & mayhem during the withdrawal scene? did you not see that coming? i'm surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. the acting was fine, sure. but to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language. things happen, but that's it. there's no glue or motive that can be detected on screen, allowing the subject matter to use pre-existing emotional connections to furthur the plot, without the script doing it like it's supposed to.
