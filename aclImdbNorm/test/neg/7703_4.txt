let me start out by saying that i am a huge fan of abbie hoffman and have read steal this book and steal this urine test. also am a even bigger jerry rubin fan. but his movie was a discusting pile of rubbish that made a very pg version of abbie hoffman. the director took no chances into making abbie hoffman interesting in this movie. they despicted stew albert as a f***ing cartoon chjaractor devoid of intellegence, the man was a proffesor at berkley for christsakes. ok they did a horrid casting job for anita hoffman, did a horrible job casting for the jerry rubin character. i just guess the movie doesnt fit the news flashes that i have seen of abbie or the books that he wrote. the movie just didnt fit and upset me. oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice over i have ever heard of richard nixon. this is one of the few movies that i have ever rented that i could not sit all the way through because, i have a passion for abbie hoffman and his discruntled band of yippies and this movie was just plain badly done. and it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the yippies they will see a terrible adaptation, and not get a true sense of reality. instead they get a hollywoodized palanthra of crap.<br /><br />
