i don't know, maybe i just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of trite melodrama. it was too long and seemed at least mildly disjointed (granted, i didn't pay full attention...). for a more entertaining depiction of the battle of stalingrad, see enemy at the gates. true, some pretentious folks will scoff because it's a hollywood film, and doesn't show "the gritty reality of war" like this "wonderful foreign film" does, but it has better flow and is all around just more fun to watch. besides, there are already enough contrivedly "gritty" war movies, and this one just seemed amateurly done. but hey, you might like it, so go right ahead; it just wasn't for me.
