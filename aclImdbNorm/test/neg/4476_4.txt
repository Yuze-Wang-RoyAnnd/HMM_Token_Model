talk about your wild life. barely a b-movie, but what the hay...corny sci-fi and lesbian sex. from the mind of writer and director cody jarrett, a cheesy slice of fun. a chemical company is dumping waste that is causing mutants in a fish farm. the hot kristi russell stars as dr. barbara michaels, an epa agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. she just happens to enter a lesbian relationship with bartender trixie(ariadne shaffer)and their love scenes are about as good as this film gets. a man-size frog incites chaos; causing a car crash, raping the chemical company boss's daughter, raping a girl under the bleachers at a football game, stiff-arm tackling a runner in the football game, raping a nun...all before being shot twice in the chest after an antidote was found all ready. the special effects...well, not special; a guy in a rubber frog costume without the genitalia to prove himself. tough tadpoles, do you still want to watch it? go ahead, but bribe any witness to secrecy.
