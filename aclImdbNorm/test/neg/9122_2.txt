the gang is back for more! ron howard and cindy williams are now married! her brother is demonstrating against the draft and charles martin smith is doing everything he can in vietnam to get sent home.<br /><br />the issues of the 60's are brought to light here, but it's all over the place, beginning with new year's eve 1963, then three minutes later, it's new year's eve 1964, then three minutes later, it's new year's eve 1965, then three minutes later, it's back to 1963 again. martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago, and a couple of scenes later, this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off, the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture (or pictures, in some cases, as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same time).<br /><br />if you want to watch this film, you have to watch this film, but i'd advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. wolfman jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background, but where'd he go? maybe he couldn't keep up with this film, either, and quit! 2 out of 10 stars!
