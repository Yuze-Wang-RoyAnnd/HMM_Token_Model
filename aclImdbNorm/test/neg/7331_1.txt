very simply, they are all the syndicated episodes and not the original uncut/unedited nbc episodes. it is not the complete first season, all eps are edited to conform to 21:00 for syndication meaning jokes are cut, an extra commercial fade is included, all of the harvey korman intros are not here...very poorly done! shame on a series i've been waiting for....booooooooooooooooo! if you're a true die hard mama fan, don't buy this and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we're unhappy on this butcher job to a classic sitcom!
