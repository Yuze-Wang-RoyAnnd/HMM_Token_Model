although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society, i don't object to the extremely high salaries for many of today's entertainers and athletes.<br /><br />a-rod, lebron or brady all have deals either well with 8 figures, or the low-9 area. ray romano and jerry seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows, huge residuals and fees they currently demand. even their cast members, and all of the "friends" group reached near or over 7 figures per episode. letterman's earnings for one show could solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two's take care of many for life.<br /><br />but all of these are based upon sound supply/demand principals, and the financial benefits they bring to their employers. and all perform their crafts ably.<br /><br />but then comes along someone like rachel ray, who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. i find her shrill, annoying, and with a forced "perkiness" that's as phony as the proverbial "3-dollar bill."<br /><br />a friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates. one of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $5-10k level, to a handful who get $200k and up per appearance. (this area includes trump, seinfeld, lance armstrong, robin williams, and, no kidding, larry the cable guy.)<br /><br />there are a greater number in the $100,001 - 200,000 range; list included the likes of bill cosby, steve martin and even cable guy larry's benefactor, jeff foxworthy. <br /><br />this category includes rachael ray. i suppose i have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her "talent" and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who'll pay more than $100k, + first class air, hotel suite, all expenses and limos door-to-door, for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization's event. <br /><br />i just can't figure how-in-the-hell this could be possible.
