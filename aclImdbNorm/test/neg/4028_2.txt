this whole movie is just so terrible it is a complete mess. the story is just so stupid i can't believe somebody actually sat down and wrote about this and thought it would make a good movie! the acting is quite possibly the very worst out of any b-movie ever made. i've seen a lot of sci-fi type b-movies before and some of them are actually pretty good, some of them however-like from venus-should never have been made.<br /><br />some movie makers think that just because they put something together and somehow got it on the shelves of a movie store, that they have accomplished something-that it is good and should be watched by people. this is not always true, and it is definitely not true of from venus. this film loses on all accounts: horrible acting, stupid plot, very weak special effects, ugliest costumes ever, non-realistic dialogue, bad direction, etc. you can just tell this film only took about $20 to make, and i may be giving it too much credit there! i urge you to stay away from this train wreck of a film for your own good!
