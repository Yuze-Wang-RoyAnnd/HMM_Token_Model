a group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in kazakhstan. in these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, the cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years, and that twist seems to be taken from an x-file. i like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. the camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up. not being a caver, it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic. there is entirely too much unnecessary pannick from supposedly experienced cavers, by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things
