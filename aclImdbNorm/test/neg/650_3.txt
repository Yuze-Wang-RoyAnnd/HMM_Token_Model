i really wanted to like this movie, but the pacing was just way too slow.<br /><br />it was a nice story, but it was really like watching a slug race.<br /><br />the movie would have been better served, if it had some more action. i don't mean anything grand, but at least something in the background.<br /><br />it could have also been helped by songs that set the tone/mood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialogue.<br /><br />it's been about 10 years since i've seen it, so i may have to give it another chance.<br /><br />3/10 or *1/2(out of four)
