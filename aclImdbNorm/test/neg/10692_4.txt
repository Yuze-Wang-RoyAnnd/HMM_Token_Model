i was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind boondock saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies i've ever seen. but the makers of "overnight" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make mr. duffy look like a putz. but it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what's boondock saints even about? how hard is it to meet patrick swayze? what are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught? because the film doesn't try to answer these questions in any coherent way, it doesn't end up having dippity-doo to say about hollywood either. so who cares?
