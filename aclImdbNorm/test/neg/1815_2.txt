after seeing the film version of heart of darkness, i feel as if i wasted 100 minutes of my life. though the book was not my favorite, i was very disappointed to see how poorly nicolas roeg portrayed the story. despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information, the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless. the book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie. <br /><br />you'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. the differences completely changed the story for me. for example, when the character of kurtz's fianc'ee is nonchalant to the fact that kurtz has died, it completely modifies the ending the book had given. not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. it sincerely feels as if roeg was filming another story with references from heart of darkness embedded in it. <br /><br />if you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like joseph conrad's tale, you may find it good. though i thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting, it is a captivating story all the same. however, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in roeg's film.
