there are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. the breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. it's always good to remember, that david hasselhoff is a god. not the god, but a god. it's not so much about his acting skills, since there are none, but his chesthair does a lot of talking. also, there's no kitt hanging out in this series, which is good, since mr hasselhoff told in an interview, that he always thought kitt was gay. naturally that might make him to look like an idiot, but considering the other statements he has made lately, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone.<br /><br />in a nutshell, this is the kind of show, that is totally harmless to people. it gives us a lot to stare at and a lot to laugh at, which is something many intentionally humoristic shows really don't give us. i have to say, it's no wonder that borat fell in love with pamela anderson. i enjoy watching the show. no, it's not a great show, actually it's quite horrible, but i enjoy watching it. it's basically like a b-movie stretched to last for a decade.
