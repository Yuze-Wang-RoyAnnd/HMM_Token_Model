i totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a great show. i'll admit that i'd seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all reenacted. but when i caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me big time and i lost interest immediately. then i noticed the disclaimer at the start before an episode that followed. has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me, did they actually make the "acting" and reenacting parts more artificial on purpose, or did i just not notice before. i'm usually pretty good at sensing this stuff, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial i practically tripped over it. now i have no interest whatsoever in watching and have given up entirely on it. it just doesn't have any real value if it's all scripted and acted. and at least lately, it seems very poorly scripted and acted. the comment above that says who cares if it's all reenactments, i do. without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened, one time this guy" heresay. it's info better read in a book.
