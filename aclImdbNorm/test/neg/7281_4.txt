i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie. i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk. it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy. another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after. i don't know how folks bleed over there in japan, but i hope they have plenty of blood donors.
