this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through. and that's saying alot, because i've seen my share of horrible movies.<br /><br />but i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser. seriously, there was not one respectable character in the entire script. how fitting that the plot was equally lame, lacking any intelligence whatsoever.<br /><br />i can't believe that keanu reeves and cameron diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity. and while i haven't seen all of their other movies, i've always enjoyed their performances until now. it's not that the acting was bad, just the entire story line was moronic.
