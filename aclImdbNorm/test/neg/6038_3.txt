friz freleng's 'snafuperman' is one of the lesser private snafu shorts. a warning of the importance of studying your field manual, 'snafuperman' makes it point rather clumsily. the story, in which technical fairy, first class makes snafu into a superhuman in order to help him see the error of his ways, is predictable and unfunny. freleng's earlier snafu short 'rumours' had been bursting with ideas and laughs but here the director is lumbered with a rather boring topic and he struggles to make an entertaining short from it. even at around three minutes long, 'snafuperman' seems to drag and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it feels like an instructional film first and entertainment second. though they were knocked out more quickly than the usual warner cartoons, the snafu shorts largely maintained a surprisingly high standard. 'snafuperman' is a reflection of the sort of quality you'd more reasonably expect from a less talent bunch of creative minds.
