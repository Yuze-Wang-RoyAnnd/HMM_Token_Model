this film gives a look at the suffering a family experiences at the death of a child, and the healing that can finally come to them.<br /><br />the family learns of the death of their son on christmas eve, 1991, ruining the christmas season for them. they do not celebrate it again for many years. there is an interesting comment by the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation.<br /><br />the matthew character makes a reference to jesus, but i suspect that other comments he makes come from non-christian sources. i wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments. if so, it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie.
