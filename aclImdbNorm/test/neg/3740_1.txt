i honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much. a friend of mine watches this and since i like sci-fi, i tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising, but in truth it really is a very boring show. the only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video game-like cgi-effects and the complete overuse of muppets. note that i call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets, not like the aliens they should be.<br /><br />speaking of which; the muppets and make-up effects are horribly overused in this show. you have this guy who could be best described as a alien/dwarf-hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp-girl, you've got a floating potty-mouth frog-alien... it just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronaut.<br /><br />every episode is also too much of a stand-alone. the creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show. at least up until the point that you see the main-characters/muppets again, that is. the whole plot about the main-character getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points. the acting is also quite bad.<br /><br />conclusion: if you want good sci-fi, just look somewhere else. this isn't even real sci-fi to begin with in my opinion, since the show is more aimed at fantasy-elements with all the puppetry and weird dreams going on. and if you just want to see muppets then i suggest you watch the muppet show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a end.<br /><br />by the way; doesn't anyone have dejavu's with the concept of a living spaceship? ohyeah thats right; doctor who started that concept almost about 30 years ago! this show is like a collection of 'sci-fi' leftovers. scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason, only to be picked up by this horrible show.
