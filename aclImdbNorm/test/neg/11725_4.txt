one would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-tv movie, it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--wallis simpson and the prince of wales--instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance.<br /><br />nor is it helped by the fact that jane seymour and anthony andrews give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.<br /><br />it's hard to understand why a star of olivia de havilland's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of aunt bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight. at this stage in her career, olivia was appearing in so many "nobility" roles requiring a regal presence but nothing more.<br /><br />a trivial movie best left forgotten among all the made-for-tv movies of that era.
