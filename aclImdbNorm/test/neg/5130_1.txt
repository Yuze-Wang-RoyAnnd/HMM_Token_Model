i registered with imdb.com just so i could comment about this movie. my god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was! it shouldn't even be touted as a real movie, this is very deceiving. this is a 15 year old's film project at best. the acting is terrible. but even good actors could not save this. the dialog is probably the worst part of this movie. who the hell wrote this crap? and that constant joke coming from the chubby lesbian about kaye being a "damsel in distress" got old real fast. god i'd rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than watch this crap again. do not rent this movie. if they gave you the movie for free do not watch it. smash it with a hammer. even if smashing this video caused you to lose your hollywood video or blockbuster video account it would be well worth it. this is an abomination. i suppose i have said all i can about this without being redundant. any questions....email me.
