ok, i admit that i still associate sophie marceau with la boum. that was the main reason i went to see this film. but it was so boring, that i nearly felt asleep. sorry, but her talents as actress are not very convincing. furthermore, this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and cgi. yeah, for a b-movie it is not that bad. after having seen her in "marquise" some years ago (also a very crappy film), i thought that she would play more convincingly. but la boum (and may be the james bond "the world is not enough") seem to be the only good films with her. is it her "talent", does she have a bad taste when choosing her films or simply bad luck ?
