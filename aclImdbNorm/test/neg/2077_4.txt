carmen is a prostitute that lives seducing and stealing soldiers of the spanish army; she is, without any doubt, the best femme fatale at the moment. when a man resist her charming attentions, she decides to do everything to destroy him. at the end, he falls in her web and he will be forced to make all the things he ever hated only for being with carmen. despite paz vega is very beautiful, she doesn't seem a gypsy (as carmen is) and neither her acting nor sbaraglia's are good. the story results very boring, and, in most moments, it is very absurd, while intending to appear truthful. in the same way are the scenarios and the special effects, despite not being but they are not but acceptable, and too much artificial for a historic film as it is. to sum up, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there are much betters thing to watch.
