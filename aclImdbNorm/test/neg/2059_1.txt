this film is a disaster from beginning to end. 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from hercules & the haunted world and hercules & the captive women badly edited together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete rip-off. i'm a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them, re-edited and re-dubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin. these kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by duping unsuspecting audiences basically killed the sword & sandal genre back in the 1960s.<br /><br />there is one memorable scene in the new footage and it's the one when hercules fights with the bad hercules. the fight is albeit cool and giovanni cianfriglia, who plays antaius, definitely stands out. he makes a memorable nemesis to herc. but the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a day.<br /><br />avoid at all cost!
