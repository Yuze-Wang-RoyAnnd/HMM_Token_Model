according to this masterpiece of film-making's script (pun intended), charles darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory, because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention. for you see, aliens sent chupacabras to the earth and they form the missing link in the evolution theory. however, the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that chupacabras are a typically puerto rican phenomenon, so i don't really know where that fits in. are they saying all puerto ricans are aliens? whatever, it's all pretty irrelevant anyway. the only thing you need to memorize is that "el chupacabre" is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur b-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style. several duos of people are chasing this goat-munching monster (remotely resembling the midget version of the pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. we have an untalented dogcatcher and a nagging female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim-witted accomplice. since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the latino immigrants of the neighborhood. the monster itself looks okay and the make-up effects on his victims' leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody. the acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing. particularly eric alegria is pitiable in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of animal control. yes, it's an incredibly stupid film, but surely you have struggled yourself through worse and less amusing low-budget garbage.
