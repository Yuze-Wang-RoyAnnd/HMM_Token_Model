imagine diane from cheers, the self centered over intellectualizing character, now imagine she was trying to make a film moire movie. this would be it. if you just looked at some of the shots without any sound you would think hmmm.. this could be a good film. <br /><br />now if you turn on the sound and listen for anytime at all you quickly realize that the person that made the film knows nothing about films beyond what they read in a book. i was continually thinking is this thing a foreign film, it was that bad.<br /><br />if you don't remember cheers, then think of mr. beans holiday... remember the defoe character that made the horrible movie... well imagine that horrible movie without mr. bean saving it. that is what this movie is. i'm not saying anything about what the movie is other than it is an attempt to make a dark moody film about a hit-man going back home.... at least that's about all i could get out of it.
