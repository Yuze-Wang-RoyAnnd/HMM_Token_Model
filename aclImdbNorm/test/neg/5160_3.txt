i should've realised it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this film bored me.<br /><br />having watched several "indie" films on the strength of the reviews on here, and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to those other reviewers, i began wondering if it's possible i am watching completely different films from these people, or are they perhaps friends/family etc of the film makers trying to 'big up' their work? hmmm.<br /><br />are you interested in seeing an amateur's homage to pulp fiction and 11:14, except done with worse actors, a silly score (undermines various scenes) and unbelievable jumps in logic? if not, then skip this film.<br /><br />here is my open letter to two of the players in this film.<br /><br />alfonso morgan, please, please, please, stop trying to 'be' samuel l jackon a la pulp fiction. no-one can do what he does as well as he does.<br /><br />director, please come up with something original. it does you a disservice to churn out this stuff pretending to be quentin tarantino.<br /><br />simply dire, and i really cannot see how anyone could say this is a good film. it is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8.5 on this, the same as films like pulp fiction or goodfellas. it is no-where near these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, i give it a 3.
