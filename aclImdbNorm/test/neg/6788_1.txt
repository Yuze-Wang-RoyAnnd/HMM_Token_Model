this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen. i always liked chuck norris in films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker. i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. i know an african american who looks like this trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude.<br /><br />chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, i think this show started great but lost steam as time went on<br /><br />they should have dumped chucks side kick
