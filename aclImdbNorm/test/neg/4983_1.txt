god, i never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this crap. there are so many ways to describe this piece of crap, that i think that if i said everything that came to mind, i would get banned by this site.<br /><br />how do i begin? well, for one, it doesn't take knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of people who've seen it. the biggest butchering of a theme song ever made is here, from a metal version, to a freaking rap version, what were they thinking? how does underdog and a electronic-heavy musical style match? the story is so basic, that i will do something i don't usually do and not even give a summary. just think this: a dog gets superpowers, fill in the rest. that's how predictable this movie is. and then comes the jokes....please kill me now. this style of humor that might not even get the kids laughing, it's that bad, well, expect that punch line after the sneezing. that was slightly funny.<br /><br />but what surprises me the most is why jason lee(ny name is earl), patrick warburton(emperor's new groove), and jim belushi(according to jim) are all here. in the shows/movies i mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job, and, excluding lee, are the best actors in this movie, but that says very little. the rest deserve golden rasberry nominations for this crap. i am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster.<br /><br />all in all, this is just as bad as doogal, which i reviewed as well, and again, my head would explode if i saw anything worse than this.
