i'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. looking at the surface of this one, it looks pretty good! you've got decapitron, the puppets, and a new villain in the totem! unfortunately, the little punk that's doing this project to animate, inanimate objects, can't act. he stinks! his girlfriend is worse. if they were left out, it would probably be cool, blade vs. the totem. i'd watch that for 2 hours. but instead, the puppets role is down played, and the whole movie suffered because of it. the mystical skull guy who created the totem is corny at best, and decapitrons appearance is long awaited, short, and really quite disappointing. you'd be better off watching the first one again.
