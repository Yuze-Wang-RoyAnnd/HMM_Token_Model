"grande ecole" is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but, if you're in need of it, a movie for an x-rated channel. although i suspect there's nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer, the plot is simply an excuse for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. there's likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth, plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa. all that's missing is a female-to-female coupling, which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot.<br /><br />the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie -- but "grande ecole" is, to be blunt about it, no more than pornography with artistic aspirations. i'm not offended by the sex. it's just repetitive and, before long, boring. where's the hays office when you really need it?
