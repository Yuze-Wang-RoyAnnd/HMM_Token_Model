this movie should be retitled: sex in the 70s in a part of new york city called greenwich village and chelsea.<br /><br />this movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the hypersexual environments of public and private sex spaces in new york city. i doubt that the manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, the time period looks like a blast. and it's rather important to document the scene to which the film refers. but as far as calling this film sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. technically it's no oscar nominee, but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject.<br /><br />overall, an "eh."
