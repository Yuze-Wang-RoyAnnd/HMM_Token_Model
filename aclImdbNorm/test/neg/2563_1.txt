steven seagal played in many action movies. most of them were bad but not bad as the patriot. this one is a z-series action low-budget movie. after operation delta force, act of war, the substitute 2, plato's run, the base, drive, sabotage, etc comes the patriot. now steven seagal is sure to be considered as a bad actor like mark dacascos, jean-claude van damme, treat williams, jack scalia, gary busey, chuck norris, michael madsen and many others. the scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (maybe because of the very bad actors) and the 4.25 bucks you spend by renting the patriot are called lost money!!! i give it 0and a half( for laughs) out of 5.
