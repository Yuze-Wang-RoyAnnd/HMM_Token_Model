there is a lot of repetitive dialogue in this movie about "cold spots" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. to recreate the feeling of the movie, i shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. i'e seen worse movies than the st. francisville experiment, but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all ("it's getting cold!") basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. this is filmed as a supposedly true documentary. it's obviously not real, but the house does contain some cold spots. spoilers- (as if you won't be able to predict most of the plot!). not much happens in this film. we have the time-honored horror cliche of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning, as a "practice" scare to warm up the audience. the people wander around with flashlights, occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace- that they mean no harm to the spirits (or cold spots) within. now and then a door will swing shut and startle somebody. of course , the ouija board makes an appearance. they chat with a ghost named "charles". a girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it. more cold spots. another door swings shut and some guy goes off about the scuff sound of the door. scuff, scuff, he says. oh my god, somebody says. "surround yourself with white light." i admit there is a good scene in the attic (where a chair is knocked over by a ghost) that really caught me off guard. but aside from some funny bad dialogue, the chair scene (the actual split-second when it is knocked over, nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. however there are still some cold spots in here. eventually, the movie ends. nobody dies. no more details necessary. i wasn't a big fan of blair witch project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to the st. francisville experiment. you may find yourself not debating whether or not this is a real documentary, but whether or not it was intended to be funny. i still don't know. but whatever it was intended to be, it failed.
