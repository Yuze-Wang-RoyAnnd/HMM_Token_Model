seeing this movie in previews i thought it would be witty and in good spirits. unfortunately it was a standard case of "the funny bits were in the preview", not to say it was all bad. but "the good bits were in the preview".<br /><br />if you are looking for an adolescent movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie.
