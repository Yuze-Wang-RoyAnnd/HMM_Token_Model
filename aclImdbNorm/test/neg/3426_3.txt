a very hyped-up, slick, edgy reinterpretation.<br /><br />they've fallen into the "because it's modern, it has to be hyped-up, slick, etc." trap.<br /><br />"romeo and juliet" carried this idea off much more successfully, but i really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. edgy film).<br /><br />just because this is a "modern" retelling, doesn't mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad, or have anything to do with drugs or guns.<br /><br />if the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words, macbeth would be a far more powerful film. as it is, read your shakespeare. read it out loud. ask your oxford dictionary some questions. skip the film. or don't, but you've been warned.<br /><br />sorry for the super-long review. imdb made me do it.
