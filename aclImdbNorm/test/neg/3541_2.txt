think you've seen the worst movie in the world? think again. the person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising. the cover makes it look like a good, scary horror suspense thriller. but, no. what we have instead is nightscream. a movie that makes a "sweeeoooowww!!" noise every time a credit flashes across the screen. the biggest name in the entire film is probably casper van dien who hardly has a part.<br /><br />i voted a one for this one only because i couldn't vote any lower. if i could vote something like negative five-thousand, trust me, i would have. so, for now, i'm going to give nightscream 1/2* out of 5 just because it ended.
