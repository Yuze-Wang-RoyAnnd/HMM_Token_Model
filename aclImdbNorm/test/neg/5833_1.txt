this was one of the worst movies that i have ever watched. the story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. all the story was about was having sex over and over again. there was no need for all of this footage - only to create a soft porn film. of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes. i don't know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie -except i assume to get men to watch it. i gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower. don't waste your money or time- it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t&a. the creature was shown only more than half way through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with signorney weaver. poor excuse for entertainment.
