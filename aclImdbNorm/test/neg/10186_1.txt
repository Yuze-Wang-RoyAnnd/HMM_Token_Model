im warning you people out there, this is just a waste of your time. i am being honest when i'm saying that this is the worst movie i've ever seen. its just a move about christian propaganda! don't throw away your life, don't see it!<br /><br />i think they made the movie so more people will believe in jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. the actors are all newbies, the story is just fuzzy!<br /><br />i think this movie is a work of the devil. <br /><br />this movie is just not worth seeing, so please take my advice and don't!
