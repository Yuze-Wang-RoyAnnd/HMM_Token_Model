11:11 a.k.a. hell's gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries too hard to be something it's not. a young girl has an imaginary play mate. one day whilst out in the fields playing with her friends, a couple of fugitives visit her parents and whack them off for no apparent reason. the young girl runs off and hides from the bad men. years later, the girl grows up into a woman with problems. losers at her school (looking like repressed homosexuals) flaunt their manhood in front of her when she rejected one of them. the girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. a secret from her past returns to visit her. who or what is it? why does everyone hate her? what's her guardian's problem with her? to find out you'll have to watch hell's gate.<br /><br />the new title makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. i don't know why people are given money to make such bad movies. this film is not even good enough to make fun of. it's a head ache inducing mess that'l confuse anyone who tries to make some sense out of it. not worth your time.<br /><br />not recommended.
