needful things was one of my favorite stephen king books. but this movie is one of the worst book to film adaptations i have ever seen they changed so many things around that it made me sick. even the concept of the book being deception, things not always what they appear reminder throughout the book was not shown in the movie. althogh it was enjoyable as many stephen king films are, but as many stephen king films this one did not follow the book and became a piece of hollywood trailer trash. 2/10
