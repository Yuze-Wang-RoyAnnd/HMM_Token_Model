all i have to say is one word...sucks!!!!. the only reason i gave this a 2 is because josh hartnett was in it and he's cool. should have beat that klein guys ass...stupid dumb and brainless. by the end of this movie you can't stand klein and you really don't care what happens to leelee. hartnett was the only good thing about it.
