when underdog the cartoon debuted in 1964, at the age of 7 i was hooked immediately. he was top dog (pun intended) in my book-(that is, until batman premiered on abc a year or so later). even when it was clear that disney was going to make a live-action version of the once popular saturday morning cartoon, it was equally clear to me that it was going to be a piece of crap. even reading the reviews in the papers seemed to confirm this. however, i made it a point to: a) never attempt to write a review unless i have seen the movie from start to finish; and b) never to spend one red cent on a movie that i'm almost certain i will hate.<br /><br />thanks to youtube i: a) am fully qualified to write this review; and b) it only cost me 84 minutes of my hard earned time.<br /><br />it also proves my point, namely, that this movie is not merely a piece of crap. it's a steaming pile of dog droppings. it resembles the tv series in name only, even though they almost got it right with simon and cad.<br /><br />all in all, underdog is a huge waste of time- and money, which thankfully, i didn't have to spend.<br /><br />rating: 1/2* out of *****
