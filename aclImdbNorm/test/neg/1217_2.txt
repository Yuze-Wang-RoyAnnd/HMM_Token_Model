zzzzzzzzzzzz. this one came directly from the "jaws" cookie-cutter mold, with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure. i was interested in seeing this after finding a still from it in a book about italian horror films, and wow...i guess i got what i deserved!<br /><br />very slow-moving and talky, much of this killer shark movie takes place on land, which isn't really that surprising. it seems like the only method they had of showing a shark is through shots of a shark in an aquarium. the shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and that's too bad...most of the characters are so annoying that you actually wish they would get eaten.<br /><br />the "plot" concerns a group of four kids who meet up with a mysterious indian on the beach one day while roasting weenies. the indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track an ancient evil that assumed the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe...supposedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god was worried they would take all the fish. or something like that.<br /><br />it's a good thing too, because wouldn't ya know it...years later, a monster shark appears and starts gobbling up people in the sleepy seaside community. when one of the four guys are eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill the thing...especially since (big shocker here) the authorities have killed a shark and they think the threat is over. yawn.<br /><br />the obligatory death scenes are unbelievably tedious, and you can see them coming a mile away (my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while they're sitting in a van, then jumps out and says "i'm going for a swim," immediately to be gobbled up by the waiting shark). they had a lot of nerve calling this film "deep blood" since you hardly see any, just cloudy water. the actors handle their cliched roles like they're all thumbs, and there is even a hilarious subplot involving a greasy rocker-type bad boy who threatens our goody-goody heroes, then turns good in the end to help kill the shark.<br /><br />it took me a really long time to find this film, it is rather obscure, so i don't think there's any danger of too many people wasting their time on this. however, if you should be lured into it...don't say you weren't warned!
