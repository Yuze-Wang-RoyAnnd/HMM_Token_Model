i vowed some time ago to never get another joe castro film (perhaps after "near death") but i sort of ended up with this one by accident, since it was a troma release & i didn't read the cover carefully. oops. well, i watched it, and it's by no means good, but it's, i guess, sort of "tongue in cheek"....if it's not, it sure seemed that way. some intrepid folks from the university of the rio grande set out to find if the chupacabra exists, because of surveillance camera footage from someone's goat barn that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision. and also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition. there's a couple of camera men, one of whom whines the whole time, and there some ex-marine named "army" (?!), who is some kind of munitions expert or something. at any rate, the do find the chupacabra on some guy's ranch & set out to find it, getting involved with two supposed witches along the way. the creature itself is rather ridiculous-looking, with spines on its back & a great big long tongue that gene simmons would die for. eventually, after a bunch of folks done get killed, so does the chupacabra, and they take it back to the university for an autopsy. so, is it from another planet? is it a genetic creation from some lab in puerto rico? uh, they don't tell us, really. not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either. definitely not a wide audience for this one. 4 out of 10.
