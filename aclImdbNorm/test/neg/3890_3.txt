before i begin, a "little" correction: imdb states that richard gere is 180 cm tall. wrong! i passed by him 10 years ago, and he can't be an ant's a** bigger than 165. i'm 183, and he looked like a child next to me.<br /><br />should have been called "wheatlands"; an appropriate title to complement malick's previous (and much better) movie "badlands". this movie shows that not all directors have as their prime objective to entertain. in fact, some of them have as their main objective to show wheat in all its splendour.<br /><br />the movie is depressing and relatively uninvolving, with the obligatory tragic ending. nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama, with the male two-thirds of the triangle not surviving the movie. praised for its visual quality; while it does have that realistic 70s feel to it, there are limits to how spellbinding wheat fields can be. you can shoot them with 1500 mm cameras, for all i care, but they are still wheat fields.<br /><br />gere, who at first seems miscast as some kind of lower-class factory-worker-turned-wheatfield-worker, is quite solid, while brooke adams appears distant and cool for most of the movie, making one wonder just how much she loved either of the two hunks. but for those looking for a movie that displays all the glorious colours of a field of wheat, look no further: you've found your dream!<br /><br />if you're interested in reading my "biographies" of richard gere and other hollywood intellectual heavyweights, contact me by e-mail.
