atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic. boyer is a french thief hiding in the casbah of algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. meanwhile, he falls for lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. the film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere. reminiscent of casablanca in some ways, it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman. it's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and boyer wooing lamarr in the shadows. personally, i didn't care for boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was utterly nonexistent.<br /><br />stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as boyer's henchmen--guys who clearly do not belong in algiers. sigrid gurie is the wildly-overacting jealous girlfriend of boyer. his brazen womanizing in front of her doesn't bode well for any future he might have with lamarr.<br /><br />especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell boyer how another henchman was captured. it sounds exciting... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. the ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a hollywood happy ending; that doesn't stop it from being sappy.
