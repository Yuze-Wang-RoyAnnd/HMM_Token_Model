i'm a fan of get shorty. this is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel.<br /><br />chili is back but rene russo is gone without a peep. unfortunately chili's game was played out in the first movie and rather than find an interesting personal arc for him, they just have him stand around repeating lines from the first movie. it's pretty tepid. travolta looks old here. it's like they move people around him because his bones are getting creaky. his pink lip gloss and the blue eye contacts are very weird. the 2nd bad role is edie (played by uma thurman). she's a music producer, a role that requires her only to be the female reuben kincaid. ("hey these kids have a great new sound.") in any scene she strikes the wrong pitch motivationally or emotionally or both. it's painful to watch. despite it's plentiful problems, be cool gets better after a very unpromising start.<br /><br />i certainly got my laughs out of it (vince vaughan running around on fire, cedric the entertainer, ludicrous, the rock, a t-shirt that says "widow" on it), but it offers no great memories after it's over. it's a helium-light love fest from the first frame. there's no one as pricelessly idiotic as gene hackman in the first movie. it's just about doing good in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (beyonce & the rock). ho-hum. the first one wasn't preachy.<br /><br />working in (repeatedly) gags & lines from the first movie is annoying as is the dumb concession to the rock's wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrow twice) as are the droll inside jokes: steven tyler saying "i'm not the kind of singer that make appearances in movies" ar ar.<br /><br />the all-star spectacular line-up is part of the problem. the first movie wasn't burdened by "stars."<br /><br />for a buck rental let's call it even.
