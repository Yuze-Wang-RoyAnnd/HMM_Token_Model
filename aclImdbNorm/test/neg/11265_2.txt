i see that c. thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.<br /><br />i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older c. thomas howell is; i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.<br /><br />in just a few words: what a very big disappointment. i give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a chatroom. they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat, she then insists on meeting the participant in person. she meets him, has sex, ties him up and then murders him in cold blood. the plot then deteriorates further.<br /><br />the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff. do not bother renting it much less purchasing it, even if it is in the $1 dvd bin. i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill. i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.
