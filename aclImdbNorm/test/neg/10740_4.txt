homecoming; what a huge disappointment!! after reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - against george w. bush!!!!!) i couldn't wait to see this. it started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. unfortunately, though, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that i didn't need to see (i can just watch some good old aussie comedy for that!). there was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary. i couldn't believe this came from joe dante, who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satire.<br /><br />the worst episode so far.<br /><br />2/5.
