ok, i'm 26 so i've been thru all the action heroes 80's hype, and chuck norris along with seagal, van damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of bullets from one round only;) i saw the advert of this movie on tv a couple of days ago - chuck norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers. whoa! 'that is a must-see crappy movie!', i said. and indeed it was. only a lot lot worse. it is very difficult to see all the movie - stuffed with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, who serve satan, all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community, which represent whole mankind - it is a load of christian fundamentalist's wet dreams.<br /><br />i've nothing against christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense, c'mon, chuck norris playing an angel, whose job is to look after little town, where satan lives?!?! the whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not mentioning its silliness (yes, it's not stupidity anymore, we're talking silliness like... like a retarded child's joke) make altogether terrible movie, made as far as i suppose for elder people very much devoted to catholic church, because young viewers laugh at almost every scene. technically it's incorrect, the fx are worse than the ones you've seen in early 90's in tv series, the plot seems very stupid, actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands, not mentioning the music which as far as i've heard was played on a childish toy piano. i've seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (the ones from the imdb bottom list) like 'space mutiny' or 'manos - hands of fate' but believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly acted quasi-movie which brings some students' prank movies to my mind rather than regular production. avoid it. at all cost avoid it. there's even nothing to laugh at. chuck norris has officially finished his movie career.
