eric roberts "stars" in this tommy lee thomas debut prison film. he plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. though evil by most people's standards, his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with "lethal weapon" electric prods.<br /><br />the movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. thomas has clint eastwood's squinter eyes, dolph lundgren's one-liners, the acting abilities of jcvd and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation.<br /><br />martin "cobra kai" kove's career shares this low point with roberts, in the film it is difficult to tell if kove's character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if kove just came that way. i couldn't blame him if he did.<br /><br />fortunately for all involved, this movie has a "so bad that it's good" quality that can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
