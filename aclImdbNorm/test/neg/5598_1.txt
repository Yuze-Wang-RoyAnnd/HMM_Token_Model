this was made in 2004 for gods sake, what happened to our state of the art special effects? what happened to our rough around the edges but still good actors? the actors in this movie were unbelievably horrible, there was one or two that weren't bad, but the rest, biggg thumbs down. couldn't stand listening to the badly written dialogue, i mean, who the heck wrote that script? please don't ever write again! special effects? don't even get me started on the special effects. surely they could have come up with better then fully fake looking green balls of light in the eye sockets. it looks so old and..lame frankly.! even the easiest thing to make look real..the teeth, they looked so fake and stupid i would almost wipe a tear from my eye in annoyance. come onnnn i cant believe this was even shown to the public.!
