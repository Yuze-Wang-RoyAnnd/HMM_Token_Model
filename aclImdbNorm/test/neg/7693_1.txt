this movie as the 1st ksa's movie should be active to their people and show the good thing on them. otherwise, we see in this as rotana's cast want show religion's people in saudi arabia as terrorist and stupid in fact their not they are very peaceful and smart. about the director is not even less good. the grandfather in movie is very younger than the father, everyone notes that. and the girls who not saudi by the way show our girls as pitches looking to man to satisfy their needs. hasham was just another part of furniture at act he did nothing to imagine only when he said to his lover i love you and yell to his friend don't talk to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or really stupid<br /><br />the father was so not moving only set their and he watch this movie as not one of cast and only word he said "a5zo al shai6an". the weird thing in this movie is when the girls were set in restaurant in family's part, there voice in behind young man talk to his girlfriends "kiss me" many times >>>>> is that happened in saudi arabia when the girls and boys grow up good and muslem not bitches and adulterer. any saudi have patriot in his heart will not allow to see this stupid movie
