when i first saw "race against fear" (don't you just love lmn movie titles?), i had to keep scratching my head. was this meant to be serious? why couldn't the main character even run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? how did i know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film? all of these questions, and no answers. then, i just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away...it was easier not to resist...then the film became funnier by the minute, and i now rank it among my top ten junk movies from lmn. some have said here that ariana richards is really talented but that the material was flawed - i heartily disagree. not only can she not convince me that she's an athlete, she's walks wide-eyed through the rest of the story, like she's just landed on earth. maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her off...at least i hope so.
