this rendition of "noah's ark" has set hallmark's (and turner's) reputation back about 100 years. however, the production has it's bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in "how not to make a movie"<br /><br />where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:<br /><br />"ok, boys, let's saddle up." "it's too bad that god created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night." "we're not kissing...we're only whispering in each others' mouths."<br /><br />lumber for building the ark with "georgia pacific" stamped on it. metal nails. kids flying kites. a peddler (how can james coburn sleep after this) selling chinese hats. pirates attacking a wooden ark, which they wished to capture, with flaming tar balls of fire shot from catapults. glass bottles of wine (noah was in a continual state of inibriation. it was a miracle that he could see the ark let alone build it.) lady godiva (mary steenberg in a blond wig tromping around the ark on a white horse...still rated g) warding off biblical pirates with an iron (teflon-lined?) frying pan. landing on mount ararat after having passed through the straights of hercules.<br /><br />etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />special effects...you've got to see them in order not to believe them.<br /><br />the list goes on. this movie must not be missed; but if you want the full tv version, you must call nbc for the screen version...but only if you agree to absolve nbc of all responsibility of ever having aired the thing in the first place. only the expurgated version exists in video stores (no pirates, etc.)...that is, those video stores that dare to stock it.<br /><br />marvin cohn<br /><br />
