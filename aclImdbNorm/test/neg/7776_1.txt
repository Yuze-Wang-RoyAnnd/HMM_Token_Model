terrible terrible movie for television. once again lifetime brings us the predictable triangle; scheming bitchy woman out to get stupid unknowing wife of yet another stupid husband who doesn't have a clue.<br /><br />i get antsy when i see these films. you may ask, why do i watch them then? i haven't a clue. usually by mistake. and the movie is so bad i can't get away from it. i wait for the bitch to get her come up-pence. and usually i'm not satisfied in how she gets her just desserts.<br /><br />now if you can believe our vixen, she steals embryos from the clinic, and how does one do that? without blood tests, dna, inquiries and recommendations. she proceeds to kill the realtor, gabrielle rose, who is on to her, in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her? she kills the mother, susan hogan, and you could predict that surmise when the mother off handedly mentions she's allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. guess what? i won't continue on this.<br /><br />finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch. well good triumphs evil, but much too slowly. victoria pratt as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, looking a bit too disheveled and obvious. tori spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time. she's got those big big bette davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head. i liked her better in trick. and tahmoh penikett plays the husband going around assuring his wife there's nothing too he and his ex-girlfriend, even though he's spotted all over town being very chummy with her, standing half naked with her in his house when he sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight. yet he continues to deny the romance.<br /><br />lifetime never disappoints the viewers with their inane plots and stories about women and their stupid husbands. wish i could give this chestnut a "0" rating.
