once upon a time quentin tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker.<br /><br />now, unfortunately, he not only makes terrible films, but puts his names to ones like this.<br /><br />a supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s, this plumbs new depths.<br /><br />believe you me, i enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even i felt kind of sleazy watching this. to use a word i never thought i would, its msysoginistic (you see, i can't even spell it.) the plot (in the vaguest sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as vinnie jones' accent, the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think of.<br /><br />this is just terrible. shocking. it almost made me cry. in horror.
