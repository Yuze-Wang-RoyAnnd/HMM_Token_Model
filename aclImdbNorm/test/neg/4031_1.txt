this was so poor i had to turn it off in the end. i have never watched such a pathetic film. i love b movies and was looking forward to more of the same but was sadly disappointed.<br /><br />this has the worst acting/plot/direction/writing, etc...... of anything i have ever seen in my life!<br /><br />my advice to anyone thinking or watching/buying/renting, don't go there!
