now i know why this movie can be bought for so cheap at the video stores. i was curious since it had three big-name stars yet was among the 'b' movies that the video apparently can't even give away! the answer is, it is a film that would attract a very limited audience: an over-50 crowd with very liberal sensibilities.<br /><br />who else who watch robert redford, willem dafoe and helen mirren give, essentially, a basic message that "cheating on your wife is okay so long as you still love her." that's the nice "feel-good message" here, particularly at the end at the end of this strange kidnapping story. who wrote this script.....bill clinton?<br /><br />i say "strange" because the kidnapper is the nicest kidnapper (dafoe) you've ever seen, except at the end. he unties his hostage (redford) frequently, which no kidnapper would risk, has casual conversations about family matters, etc. it's all ludicrous! well, the l.a. times says it's "an intelligent thriller." ha ha. well, that confirms what most people know of the l.a. times. for those of you who believe that, and haven't seen it, i won't spoil it with more of the gigantic holes in this story, particularly at the end. the fact is, it's an insult to anyone with intelligence.<br /><br />anyway, you can't fool all the people all the time, as critics have yet to figure out. here is another film they touted that justifiably bombed at the box office and video store.
