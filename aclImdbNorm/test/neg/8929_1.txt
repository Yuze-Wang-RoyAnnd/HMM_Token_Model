it's been 3 months and you know what that means...a new seagal movie. seagal has really been on role making horrible film after horrible film. each time every movie getting worse and worse, he's really amazing! i don't really know what to say about tyd, first it's a piece of crap, the story makes no sense at all, secondly he uses stunt men in all his fight scenes, and last but not least a lot of the footage is taken from other movies! it amazes how this guy continues to find work, he comes to the set late and leaves early and because of that his films are full of plot holes and stunt men. why do we continue to buy his movies, why do we continue to have hope that maybe just maybe he will make a great movie?
