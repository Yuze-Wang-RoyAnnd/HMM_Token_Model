i appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of moses and the exodus of israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon moses' shoulders. as excited as i was to see this film, i was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (i'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) what is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from biblical texts. one of the overarching principles from the bible is that *god* led his people out of egypt, and he promised that he would take them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey. not only did he give this promise, but he led his people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. he never left them; he always was visible to the israelites. the movie, however, depicts a god who remains silent during the entire wandering through the desert. this movie changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead depicts god as a silent, cruel, disciplinary void.<br /><br />in addition, the depiction of moses was just as wrong. moses was known as a man of faith (why else would he be such a father-figure to israel throughout the old and new testaments, even that moses is known as a man of great faith). however, the movie depicts him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure loner who despises the calling that god placed on his life. ok, i'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the exodus story... but this is beyond creativity -- it is heresy.
