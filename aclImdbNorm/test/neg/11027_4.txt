carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. the scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. some are capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. there's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. it's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable. only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors--some smaller parts, such as judge doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.
