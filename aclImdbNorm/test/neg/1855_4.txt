the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair. presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape. one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got contacted by her agent, the conversation went along the lines of: 'do you want to shoot a movie in dublin scripted by neil jordan? michael caine and michael gambon are already in!' this is a dull 'comedy' that sees michael caine and dylan moran try and pull off a well-planned hustle where moran must imitate a london gangland boss (whose arrival is imminent) to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin michael gambon. the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly. moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books. caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched. one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie - it can't even have been a summer in dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background. gambon actually steals the show, and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man. but overall the result is disappointing, and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of mona lisa.
