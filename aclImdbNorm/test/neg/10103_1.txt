horrible acting with the worst special f/x i've ever bore witness too. it's bad enough i wasted $3 to watch this crummy pile of crap, but it's the hour and a half time i lost that i could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. getting drunk couldn't even help this video.<br /><br />to put it bluntly, i sincerely believe i actually lost a few iq points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind-numbing "work"! perhaps i should have followed my own advice this time. never expect a decent film if it's written, directed and produced by the same person, and never ever expect anything of value from jeff fahey.
