a potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with. roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth; hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and stamp can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex-london crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at eton. as for poor laura del sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern european's idea of the stereotypical latino woman who's all pouts and hot temperament. if you're a fan of any of the main actors don't disappoint yourself or fool yourself (as i suspect many of the other reviewer's here have done). watch it by all means but stay critical; you know these guys can do better.
