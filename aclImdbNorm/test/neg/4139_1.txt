a complete zero out of four. one worst sums up ajooba: awful. actually, more words come to mind: ridiculous, third-rate, and terrible. this is one of amitabh's worst movies ever, he prances around in a cheap leather jacket and equally cheap tinsel foil zorro-style mask with what appears to be wings on the sides.<br /><br />the movie is set in ancient persia or arabia and is characteristically un-historical for an indian movie. as stated above, a leather jacket from k-mart with velcro straps did not exist 400 years ago, unless all my history teachers were wrong.<br /><br />rishi also does his patented cross-dressing in this movie. far from being funny, it is very embarassing to watch. what could possess the son of the legendary raj kapoor to flay the memory of his house like this on screen?<br /><br />on the plus side, if you want a real laugh, go ahead and watch this film. the glaring inconsistencies in the plot and costumes are no match for the awful dialogues and shoddy acting.
