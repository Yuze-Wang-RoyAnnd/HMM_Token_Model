after seeing this film i felt sick to my stomach and if i had seen one more minute i would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. a sick film that was not funny and was not worth the money, any money at all. if anybody ever wants to see this movie don't! your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. so if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie. i beg of you, don't!
