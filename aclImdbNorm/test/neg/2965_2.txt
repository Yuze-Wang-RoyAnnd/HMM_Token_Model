fame did something odd. it was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen (most are based off of broadway musicals), but it spawned a tv series and a broadway musical. let me correct that sentence. fame is not a musical. musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters' feelings. the singing in this music is not used to do either; in fact, there's no use for it at all. people just randomly sing to fit in with the plot. and that's not the type of musical i know.<br /><br />the so-called plot of fame has an onslaught of characters (who are all introduced at once-last time i saw that in a movie [gosford park] it had disastrous results) who audition for, and get into, new york high school for the performing arts. all of them are in for different reasons-i.e. acting, singing, etc. quote-unquote drama unfolds as these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years.<br /><br />my largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective. after all, it's a free college, and they can't let everyone in. so how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college? obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people. and why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end, for no reason at all, except to make us feel uncomfortable? there's many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into, yet you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are! these relationships occur between people whose names you don't know. and these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie, yet you don't realize that, because you don't know what they were like in the first place.<br /><br />as for the singing, it pops in randomly (and is supposed to be humorous?) and does nothing. when the title song is sung, it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say ferris bueller everyone's in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off-beat to it. the song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. i would say more, but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head. just don't see it. you'll be doing yourself a favor.<br /><br />my rating: 2/10<br /><br />rated r for language.
