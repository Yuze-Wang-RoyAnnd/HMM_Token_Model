i paid $2.00 for this piece of crap, i want my money back. it is a d grade horror movie that isn't so groovy<br /><br />there are many many floors in this film, including the acting, the lack of actual horror, the lack of nudity (which besides the starting nurse (porno outfit) and the still breathing nude corpse flash, there is none.<br /><br />the sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffs/tracks.<br /><br />there are your usual typical characters, the jock, the jocks woman, the nerdy guy (who looks more like a jock), the rookie cop/ranger (who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar coins into that gap..or go for a field goal) the mysterious fella and the pure girl.<br /><br />the make up was pitiful with side views of dr chopper showing a clear "make up line"and natural skin tones, the cover art to the dvd is clearly photoshop/enhanced to make the cover more enticing as dr chopper looks like an old "plopper" the scraggy women that hang around dr chopper are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this movie.<br /><br />the plot twist was very predictable and the abundance of bad looking fake limbs was laughable, what did they think,.... um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror film.<br /><br />dr chopper himself is the most stupid character created i've seen in a while, though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme doctor and chopper (bike) and thought "bingo" ill make a crappy movie about that.<br /><br />i've seen worse before..... but this is just plain bad.. everything about it is bad... the lack of suspense...the lack of actual horror or character development... the lack of a decent storyline ...the only thing good about this film was when it finished. this film doesn't fall into the category "its so bad its good" for me either/<br /><br />overall 2/10 the director/writer/editor should know better.
