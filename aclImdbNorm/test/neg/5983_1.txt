there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call "good". the acting was dull and sedated. the sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a starbucks and tried to make the perfect gap commercial. characters have no drive, motivation, or reason for us to care about them. there's such a lack of interest and tension that it's hard to follow the banal action and dialog. and the plot... if anyone finds it, i'm sure it would be as boring as everything else.<br /><br />this isn't funny, it's not romantic, it doesn't reflect on the human condition. if you want a good stoner comedy, watch half-baked; if you want a good stoner drama, watch trainspotting. the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the mid-late 90's cast. which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star, but, then again, this is a shallow movie.
