i rented this dvd because i'm a big science fiction fan, but this thing (i won't call it a film, because it was obviously shot very quickly on video) seemed like they made it up as they went along. i'm still not sure what it was about. there's these guys dressed up in some weird s&m outfits, and i guess they're from another planet, anyway, not much makes sense in this low, low, low, budget film. if it was their first film, i'd cut them some slack, but i think it's like their 5th film and it's really really bad.<br /><br />very bad acting not one good actor is this movie. this director must have been out of his mind to even work on a horrible film like this. don't waste your time or money on this dvd please people don't. it is not even worth the .99 cents i paid to rent the dvd. in fact i'm going to tell them the dvd was messed up to get my money back. i don't believe in giving anything at all a bad review but i must here. my advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship--please find another profession to get into. how could you make a rotten movie like this? i would give this negative stars if possible, it's that terrible.
