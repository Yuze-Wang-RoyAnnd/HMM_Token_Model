i saw this last night at the tribeca film fest and holy god was it bad.. from the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked. not to mention the set design/costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so). even john hurt, who's usually an amazing actor, was so over-the- top ridiculous. granted, quinten crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with, but hurt was given nothing to work with here. i don't know much else to say except the audience i saw it with absolutely loved it.. so maybe it's just me. but audiences love anything at film festivals when they're sitting next to the director and all the actors. it's not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play. personally, i thought this movie was terrible. on the other hand, it was so terrible that it was hilarious. get drunk and give it a shot when it's on hbo in 2 years, if it ever makes it that far.
