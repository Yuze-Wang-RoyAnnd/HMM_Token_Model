"eaten alive" goes down much easier than ruggero deodato's "cannibal holocaust," but it's also a far more sillier film. i mean, at times it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so mind-numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end. tough guy robert kerman (cannibal holocaust) teams up with janet agren (the gates of hell; here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungles of new guinea for agren's sister, who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (ivan rassimov). along the way, they fall witness to (sometimes real) animal torture and some cheesily rendered cannibalism. as directed by umberto lenzi, the movie is so over-the-top it's hard to take seriously, but if you enjoy trash cinema with more than a few unintentional laughs, it's not bad.<br /><br />4/10
