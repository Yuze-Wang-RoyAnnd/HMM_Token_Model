supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels overly long at 80 minutes. years ago, a bunch of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned up in a forest fire. years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire. a bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own. despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (jackson bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way. before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. no surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates, leaving the "final girl" to fend for herself, although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement, the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster.<br /><br />the story itself couldn't hold the weight of feature length, so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release. on the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice. also among the highlights are bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death sequence, ok gore, and the great jackie coogan in his final film role, as the bumbling local sheriff. this is a far cry from charlie chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. this is for slasher completists only.
