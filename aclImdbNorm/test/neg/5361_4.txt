this show was rushed, and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials (when it came back from commercial, the noise or "surprise" was something simple like a mouse) this is a pure rip-off of ghost hunters and it attempts to go "beyond" them, and fails miserably. also, what is with the directors log thing? is this star trek? it just ruins the novelty of this show, which wore off quick. the only reason it's been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anti-climatic nature of it. they never find anything, and most likely never will. funnily enough, they always point out something that is the thing they are "hunting" and guess what?! it's the local radio station's tower light that is blinking red!
