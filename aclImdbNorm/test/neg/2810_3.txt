if rich people are different from us because they have more money, then film makers are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought.<br /><br />this self-indulgent piece of tripe seems to have been made just because the director felt it was time to make another movie, and someone would finance it. not every trivial idea or reflection is worthy of a movie (unless you are a college film student trying to complete a course). when you don't have anything to say, sometimes it is best to remain quiet.<br /><br />the visuals are not breath-taking. they are quite ordinary. the dialog is inane and unbelievable. they speak words no one would every sequence together in situations that are beyond imagination. germaine greer's zipless f**k is finally brought to the screen. even if you believe in love at first sight, no one falls into bed as easily as these characters. they screw before they talk. even more unbelievable is an aging, balding director finding instant sex with the most beautiful chick in town, though gravity is already getting to miss marceau at a youthful age.
