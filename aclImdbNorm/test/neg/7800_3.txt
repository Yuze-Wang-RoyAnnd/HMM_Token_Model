almost certainly staged montage of women reading lines (very briefly) and getting naked (not very briefly) in front of a anonymous (and uncredited) panel - almost certainly including producer charles band. thrown in are random scenes of surrender cinema's many movies (primarily lesbian scenes). most of the women like "riding horses" (hmmm); there is a polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition; a 'secret; camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen...<br /><br />jacqueline lovell (too made up but still beautiful) introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and talks in a 'sexy' way to the camera (if you enjoy lesbian scenes the one with lovell and vanesa taylor from femalian is included and they are probably the best looking lesbian 'couple' ever). weird excuse for a movie and aside from the obvious draw of naked women, a frankly dull and uninspiring experience.
