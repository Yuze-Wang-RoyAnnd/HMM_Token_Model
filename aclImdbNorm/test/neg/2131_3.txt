i wish i had something more positive to say about devil fish, but i honestly can't seem to come up with much. i can't even come up with many of those "so bad, it's good" kind of moments. devil fish is just plain old bad. the plot is completely derivative (jaws, anyone?), the acting is wooden, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are beyond bad, and the score is annoying. add to that the seemingly inept direction of lamberto bava and you've got one stinker of a movie. i think, however, that the film's biggest sin is its lack of a budget. it doesn't appear that bava had much to work with. by 1984, the italian film industry was in full decline
