you'd have more excitement cutting off your testicles than watching this, clearly a trick to get you to rent "descent" instead of "the descent", which is a much better movie.<br /><br />this is a total rip off of "the core" and much, much worse as regards special effects, i could do better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of tinfoil, i mean come on!....that "mole" thing, bore more resemblance to a vibrating dildo than a subterranean vehicle .<br /><br />don't watch it - if you do you'll find the room your in has a funny smell for days after and you'll have this nagging feeling in the back of your head that you should go kill yourself or something.
