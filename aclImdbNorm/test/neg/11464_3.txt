this movie is called "solomon kane". which it isn't. the main character wears a hat, but that's all he has in common with robert howard's character solomon kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of publications ever since these days. it is a fantasy movie, not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review - if it hadn't been called solomon kane. the hero is a newly invented character who definitely is not sk. the story is not robert howard, neither.<br /><br />as a fantasy movie it is one more movie following the traditions of the genre: simple story, poor cgi, poor actors, poor directing. yet it can be fun, you know: 'the cheaper they are, the better they are'. but since it is called solomon kane, i cannot accept it. imagine a lord-of-the-rings movie with a hero bilbo who fights the black sorcerer saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend aragorn and the beautiful heroine shadowfax. and with a final fight where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has transformed into the dragon gondorian. imagine that. this is exactly what this movie has done with robert howard's character solomon kane.<br /><br />i'd give it a 4 stars review if it was just another horror movie, but since it is called solomon kane, i can only rate it 3 stars.
