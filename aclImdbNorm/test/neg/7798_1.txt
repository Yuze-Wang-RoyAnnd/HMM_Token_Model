i saw the preview in femalien and thought it could be a cool film. turns out, it is an awful garbage. there isn't much nudity in the film, not to mention not having much sex either. there were just some dumb and corny dialogues along with some noninteresting dancing you usually expect to see during audition. in our case, you may even see it in the actual films. conclusion: i ain't got none for it. just leave it alone.
