the most obvious flaw...horrible, horrible script. this movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined with bad dialogue, continuity problems, things that were never explained, gaping plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere, and just plain stupidity. not to mention the awful, cliched directing of sandra locke. not even two great performances could've saved this movie. so it didn't matter that devon gummersall and rosanna arquette give horrific performances. the thing is, they're better actors than this movie would have you believe. the best of the arquettes, rosanna arquette (silverado, after hours, desperately seeking susan) has some fine moments - like a great scene in the beginning when she painfully pulls her handcuffs off - but gives an overall weak performance, by her standards. and devon gummersall (dick, when trumpets fade, and the brilliant my so-called life) is much worse, acting with no conviction or emotion what-so-ever. but i won't lay blame on the actors, who have been good in other roles. the script is awful, and the bad direction doesn't help. do me a favor...avoid this movie.
