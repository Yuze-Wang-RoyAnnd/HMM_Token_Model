man alive, is this game bad or what? the graphics are way below par, even if it were on a playstation 1, never mind a gamecube. the gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. what a worthless game!<br /><br />i totally love warner's batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way. batman: vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. i really must stress how bad the graphics are. don't let the color schemes fool you. i've seen better stuff on a commodore 64.
