this movie was shot using a digital camera, and it shows. there were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, also with the help of a terrible score. as if that weren't enough, the acting was also terrible. now in hartley's movies the acting is always peculiar, but here it was just bad, especially by satan (thomas jay ryan)and harvey, who (thank god) doesn't get to say much. after all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good, either. the jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward, and the events just rumble on from one incident to the next. the so-called book of life with armageddon inside isn't much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines. all in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort. thumbs down.
