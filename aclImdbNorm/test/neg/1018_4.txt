the dvd for this film is by alpha video--a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints. in alpha's defense, often that is the only print available, but the specialize in public domain and cheap-o films. if you can find another print by a different company, try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded. still, compared to most alpha dvds, this one is excellent--especially since the sound is pretty clear (and alpha never seems to include closed captionings--even with films with horrid sound).<br /><br />a man has been dating a lady for a very long time. one night, he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. soon afterwords, he comes clean to his fianc'ee about this, she forgives him and they marry.<br /><br />very soon after the wedding, he gets a frantic call from the other woman--she needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself. when they meet, he learns that she has an std and she wanted him to know that he, too, might now have it. then, although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! the makes a huge mistake. he does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife. some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! at this point, the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people (actually, these were just films of people with stds that they spliced into the film--most of whom have syphilis).<br /><br />in some ways the film is very progressive. it addresses a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urges--but only with each other (not bad advice at all). on the other hand, the film never exactly says what it's talking about. they never use the terms std, vd or the like, nor does it even name the diseases. often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it's talking about herpes or other stds--the information just isn't very clear or specific--a very common problem with such films from this era. audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their 'faster' friends explain it all to them! <br /><br />speaking of "such films", in the 1930s-50s, lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex (though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in hollywood films). many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over-done and the information so inaccurate. the most famous examples are reefer madness and sex madness (both by the same two-bit production company) and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are, this cheap film seems like it should be in the criterion collection!! <br /><br />interestingly, there are weirdos out there (i would definitely be included among them) that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun. this one, however, isn't that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films. while the message really should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 film it's pretty good--despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene. remember kids--just say 'no' to suicide!<br /><br />oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. nowadays, it's a lot more treatable--as are the rest of the stds.
