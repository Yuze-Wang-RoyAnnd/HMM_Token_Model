this movie is absolutely terrible... definately a bull***t story and even worse acting. too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies.<br /><br />the special effects are 'a-team'-standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood.<br /><br />of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say '-die evil americans'.<br /><br />unless braindead movies are you game, don't spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish. pick up 'the platoon' or 'apocalypse now' instead.
