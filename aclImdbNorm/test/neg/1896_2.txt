i watched the version with pathetic american over-dubs, maybe this made it much worse, but from what i could make out the film was pretty bad anyway. it seemed low budget. the visuals reminded me of a second rate tv movie, random white dog substituted for dogmatix, embarrassing 60's bbc costumes, etc. mainly though, i feel like the characters in the movie did not behave anything like the characters in the comic, and as a result i never felt willing to even try to forgive the poor look of the film. it is always going to be hard to capture the feel of the comics in a film without using animation, and i didn't feel this attempt was worth it ultimately.
