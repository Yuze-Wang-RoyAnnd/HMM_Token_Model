or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90's flicks?<br /><br />i mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets. med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; flatliners. bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past, very bad things? groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies. sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd is bunch of lazy bastards who can not come up with their original scripts.<br /><br />noble idea totally fubarred in it's execution.
