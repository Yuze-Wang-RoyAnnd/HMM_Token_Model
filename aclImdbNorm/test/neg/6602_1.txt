usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity, its, at the very least, campy (i.e. cybill shepherd as martha stewart, lauren bacall as doris duke), this is the most horrendous, cheap, and boring television movie ever made. if vh-1 is going to make a television film, they have got to spend a little more money on them. flex alexander--though gifted with the michael voice--is not a great dancer, does not resemble michael one bit, and does not even have his mannerisms down. vh-1 would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator, that way when see michael go into get plastic surgery, he doesn't actually come out looking exactly the same. why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film? the woman playing elizabeth taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her, and don't even get me started on the woman as janet jackson. terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep vh-1 from producing any more movies. flex alexander would have made a much better jermaine jackson rather than michael. costumes? trashy ripoffs. neverland? spliced together footage from news docs. don't bother with this one....its not even remotely worth it. the one good piece of casting--the actor portraying joseph jackson and maybe the actress as lisa marie presley, though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl.
