thinly-cloaked retelling of the garden-of-eden story -- nothing new, nothing shocking, although i feel that that is what the filmmakers were going for. the idea is trite. strong performance from daisy eagan, that's about it. i believed she was 13, and i was interested in her character. the rest left me cold.
