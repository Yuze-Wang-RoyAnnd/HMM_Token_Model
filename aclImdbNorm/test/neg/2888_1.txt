this flick is worse than awful! it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema. the photography is extremely amateurish . . . looks like a 5th graders home movie project filmed with malfunctioning 8mm kiddie cameras . . . the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks (while on drugs and booze), with scenes cut short, followed by other, unrelated scenes, then chopped segments of scenes pasted in . . . totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity . . . missing scenes . . . daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night-time scenes, then suddenly back to daytime . . . obviously no continuity. tom skerritt, wendy hughes and james mason's good acting skills are wasted, as are the talents of the "key" supporting cast - (forget the villain and the anderson women - very amateurish acting). this movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with skerritt and hughes . . . just have it professionally done this time.
