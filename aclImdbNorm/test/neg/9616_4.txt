***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** what's going on here ?<br /><br />barbara hershey, looking decidedly unsexy - as if she'd stolen her granny's spare wig - puts in an unconvincing performance as a woman who kills the wife of a man she has had an affair with 'in self defence' after hitting her forty odd times with an axe.<br /><br />like lizzy borden, she is acquitted but after the most unconvincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of a supposedly 'innocent' defendant i have ever seen.<br /><br />lizzy borden took an axe and gave her father forty whacks when she saw what she'd done - she pleaded self defence<br /><br />i don't think so<br /><br />i find the defendants guilty of screening an unconvincing portrayal and have no alternative but to award this film a sentence of 4 out of 10 (which would have been lower but for the previous good behaviour of some of those involved)<br /><br />
