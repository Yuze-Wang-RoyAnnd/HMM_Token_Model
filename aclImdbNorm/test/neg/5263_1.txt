kate is a jaded young woman who has trouble meeting and dating guys. throughout the movie, you get to meet several of her loser boyfriends. and throughout the movie, you are subjected to kate's cynical negative outlook on love and relationships. this negative viewpoint is continued throughout and presented as ultimate truth. i had a real problem with this. why would anyone want to be taught about love, life, and dating from someone who is obviously so messed up? it would work if that was the joke, but it is not. for the jokes in the movie (which are neither funny nor original) to work at all, you have to believe what kate is saying: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad or no sex, that the highest level a relationship can evolve to is when you are able to fart in front of your partner... you get the idea.<br /><br />there is no movie in recent memory that comes close to upsetting the stomach as much as love & sex. why did the filmmakers waste their time on such trash? every joke in love & sex is something that i have experienced in another movie or in my own life. there is nothing original or creative about the story, the production, or the style. it is cynical, dumb and pointless. mind numbing!
