the concept is excellent. the execution typifies the overall quality of the abc network.<br /><br />apart from peter jones it appears that the rest of the panel consist of marketing execs. rather than real entrepreneurs.<br /><br />when i realised that peter jones was getting together with simon cowell my initial thoughts were wow he's gonna take america by the balls. but it appears that abc have come along and destroyed the concept.<br /><br />i was an absolute addict of the dragons den in the u.k. and was interested to see that peter jones had manipulated the concept that originated in japan and developed his own show for the states. the result is neither inspiring nor informative.<br /><br />if you lack drama in your life you have a choice now
