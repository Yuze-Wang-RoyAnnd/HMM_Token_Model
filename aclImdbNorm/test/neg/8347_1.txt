the story of a volcano erupting downtown l.a. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie. this one though, is missed bigtime. the movie looks chaotic, has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad.<br /><br />im in agreement with a lot of comments that lee jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field. in this one, he is heading the emergency office. being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes. clever thinking. ann heche touching walls and walking in tunnels that suppose to be 678 degrees fahrenheit. yea right. aside from the bad acting those factual errors make the film look almost as silly as armageddon. the only good point of this movie is that there is no ben affleck to make matters even worse. avoid this movie at all costs.
