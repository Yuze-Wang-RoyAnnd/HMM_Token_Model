rise of the undead starts as some huge nuclear type blast rips through an unnamed american city, a few people survive in a building by leaning on the door so it'll stay closed & keep the nastiness out(!). they argue amongst themselves for ages, then a monster thing arrives from seemingly nowhere & begins to kill them of one-by-one...<br /><br />written, produced & directed by jason horton & shannon hubbell one has to say rise of the undead is terrible. the script takes itself very seriously but makes little sense, the first thing i asked myself was if there's this huge nuclear blast type thing going on outside destroying the entire city why are these people i'm watching still alive? why is the building they are in still standing? then i asked myself when was something actually going to happen, the entire first 20 minutes is set in one room, actually that's a bit generous it's more of a corridor as the main character's argue. then it turns into some return of the living dead (1985) rip-off with a government created virus which turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt, pointless & seemingly random plot twists i've ever witnessed which renders most of what has just happened a complete waste of time. then for the final 30 odd minutes rise of the undead turns into some strange sci-fi type thing as something which resembles a ball of energy floats around killing everyone, was i the only asking what this floating ball of energy thing is & where it came from? getting back to what was happening outside what was the reason again? oh that's right we are never told. rise of the undead is a mess, the character's are awful & aren't even given names, the twist about halfway through will have you tearing your hair out in frustration, the dialogue sucks, nothing is explained & there's virtually no story here. the final 10 minutes (maybe a bit more) of rise of the undead features no dialogue whatsoever & the film just suddenly ends.<br /><br />director's horton & hubbell were obviously working on a low budget, the entire film is set in about two rooms & three corridors! the photography is awful, they use annoying colour filters seemingly at random & sometimes it really does look like rise of the undead was shot on a camcorder. there's no special effects, there's some fake blood splashed around but no actual make-up effects to speak of. there are some cgi shots of the city being engulfed in flames which look alright but the floating ball of energy creature thing looks terrible. there is one baffling shot early on where two people are sitting against a corridor wall & talking, for some bizarre reason their heads are cut off at the top of the screen! just their lower bodies from the neck down are seen yet nothing else is happening in frame, they are not moving & there's no else there but for some strange reason their heads are cut off the top of the frame as they talk to each other! it's quite an odd thing to watch actually.<br /><br />with an ultra low budget of about $10,000 & according to the imdb shot in two weeks i have to congratulate the makers for getting rise of the undead finished & distributed but that's where my congratulations stop because otherwise this has awful production values & is set in about three corridors which are located somewhere in new orleans in louisiana as that's where rise of the undead was shot. the acting sucks so i won't dwell on it.<br /><br />rise of the undead sucks, it sounds like a zombie film but in all honestly it isn't, everything about it is sub par & i know the filmmakers were working on a low budget but that's not really an excuse as far as i'm concerned. definitely not recommended.
