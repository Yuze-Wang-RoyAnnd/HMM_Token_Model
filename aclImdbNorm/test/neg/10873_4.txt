director/lead larry bishop tried way, way too hard with hell ride. the movie wants to be edgy, witty, provocative, outlandish, biting all of this, seemingly in a quentin tarantino/rob zombie style. but it's not edgy. the references seem forced. the dialog tries to be clever and fails. the humor is never funny. nice try setting a gritty tone but we'd have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed.<br /><br />what you're left with are cool harleys and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired, old and out of shape "bad boys" in what looks like an attempt to do a modernized sergio leone western. if this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films, kudos for it. but on its own, it is rather boring and irrelevant. i do believe there is a place for style over substance. but this movie is not it.
