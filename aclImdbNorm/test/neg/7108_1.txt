my poor tank girl, they ignored everything great about you. why does it have as little to do with the comics as possible? i would have loved a movie that followed the plot, or at least had the characters right.<br /><br />why was tank girl american? she's austrailian, dammit! and she's not living in a post apocalyptic war zone either, she lives in the outback with booga like a savage. she does it because she wants to live that way, not because she has to because malcolm mc dowell is acting the git. and why's she looking after those kids? the only children in the comics end up violently being choked by her, it's terrible that they made her into a lame mother figure.<br /><br />and my poor jet girl and sub girl! in the comics, jet is a sarcastic wisecracker and sub girl is... another sarcastic wisecracker with a weird sense of humour. in the movie jet is this mousy little thing and sub is this ditzy middle aged hag. and booga doesn't look or act anything like what he's meant to be either. though maybe hot roo/human love was too much for the usa box office? the humour was so lame too. whatever happened to all the stuff about the smiths and that brilliant slang they used all the time? what sort of line is "will this take long? i don't wanna miss baywatch."? even programmes for tiny children can come up with better material than that.
