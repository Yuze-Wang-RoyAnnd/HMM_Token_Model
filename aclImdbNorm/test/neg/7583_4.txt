roger spottiswoode isn't the worst director, and he did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller "the sixth day" (a.k.a. "the box office downfall of mr. schwarzenegger"). however, "air america" has to be one of his most inept projects.<br /><br />it comes across as an amalgamation between drama, comedy and war film - it's not a very convincing mix. in fact, i found it to be overbearing.<br /><br />robert downey, jr. (during his heyday) stars as a pilot recruited into a top secret cia organization operating during laos in the vietnam era. mel gibson plays his co-pilot and he stumbles upon the knowledge that they're trafficking drugs, and what not.<br /><br />the movie was hyped on release because it starred two famous faces and aerosmith had re-recorded the doors classic "love me two times" for the soundtrack.<br /><br />the redo of the song is pretty poor, which suits the film.
