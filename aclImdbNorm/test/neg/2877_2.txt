the basic plot of 'marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop. an american actress marigold, played by ali carter gets stuck in india. worse that, she is out of money. she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation. here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem, played by salman khan. basically, the movie fails at the script level. just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn't guarantee quality cinema. marigold stands out as the best example. the art direction is weak and outdated. musically, marigold turns out to be a dud. shankar-ehsaan-loy's is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear. actingwise, salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date. ali larter is good and has immense screen presence. performance wise too, she is good.<br /><br />one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
