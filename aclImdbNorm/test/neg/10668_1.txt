if you feel reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. his face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. this is way far from a real love story (get the spelling right, reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, himesh getting imprisoned, himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ... if you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this one, especially the scenes where he howls in mehbooba. if you despise the nasal twangs, and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of reshammiya can do to you, then don't miss this movie.<br /><br />i couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the very end. the only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography, locations, and a couple of the songs. even then, until you are a die hard reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
