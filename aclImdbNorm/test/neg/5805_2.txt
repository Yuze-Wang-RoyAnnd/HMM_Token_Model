positively ridiculous film.<br /><br />if doris roberts, shirley jones and shirley knight persist in these kinds of films, they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full-time.<br /><br />while the idea that a 35 year old swinger, who works on video games, loses his apartment and his forced to move in with grandma roberts and borders jones and knight, this is foolishly dealt with. imagine the 3 bags getting high on stuff that grandson alex has left in their home and jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her grandson!<br /><br />the video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film. the assortment of characters that alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his weed habit along with the others.<br /><br />terrible best describes this miserable film.
