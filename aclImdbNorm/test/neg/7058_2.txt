when i was 13 or so i was lucky enough to find this film. it was part of an endless danish series of really cheesy stuff. this however was the cheesiest i ever owned - but i guess i sold it, too bad. well what to write... better than "manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "critters 4". but it's definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it. the acting isn't that terrible compared to several other eighties trash - in fact i kind of like the old man even though he did'nwt look that indian to me. but i guess you can't have everything... do yourselves a favour and look this up...
