assault on precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film i've seen since charlie's angels 2. the shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. <br /><br />spoilers ............................................................. i know they've said this movie is a remake descendant of rio bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch rio bravo? besides the fact that rio bravo is a western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (john wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang. no one wants to liberate anyone in assault on precinct 13. they want everyone dead. so, my first question would have to be, why not just burn the whole place down from the start? why "assault" the place at all? i know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn't make sense and/or was presented properly. if the veteran cop was in on it from the start, why the need for this whole movie? if the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege, how did he even get the chance? as soon as he appeared at the door he would've been shot and they would've had their entry point. it's all just fubar. <br /><br />what part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) but no one notices?? however, as soon as there's a fire they have to "leave before the fire department shows up"?????? how did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside?? police issue bullets in the walls, bullet casings, footprints, equipment usage, and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of "bishop's men" to be found? how about those police snipers? how could they possibly miss so badly so often? i like the fact that when the two detainees tried to run, the snipers were foiled by two tiny mounds of snow. as if it's not possible to shoot a high powered riffle through a pile of snow. <br /><br />the set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely no reason at all. i know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience. don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one? that particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth (that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt). the conclusion remains steadily stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an austin powers-like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured. i know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of detroit city (>snicker<) but why did ethan's character just wander off in to the woods in the first place? he doesn't even look to see if the suv with the secretary and his friend gets away? they just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods, pistol in hand. gack. i could go on but won't. all i can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost.
