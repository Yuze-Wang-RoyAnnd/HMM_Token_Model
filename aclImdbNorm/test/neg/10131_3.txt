the affair is a very bad tv movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as hesitant lovers. she has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. he's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. their affair, such as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but goes along with it anyway. two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: wood's jane fonda hairdo that is never mussed, no matter what, and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick. she sings it for four or five or six minutes, so you know it's classic padding between commercials. it also is one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman doing wood's singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery. also, keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses. by comparison, wagner looks relatively timeless, with close-cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits.
