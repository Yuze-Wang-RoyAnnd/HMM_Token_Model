what an awful adaptation. the worst part was the music. saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? the only character that didn't bore me to sleep was robert hardy. i had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and i love jane austen movies usually. i didn't even rent it, i borrowed it from the library. they should have paid me to take it. i don't quite understand how catherine and henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of jane austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. this is probably on my list of the ten worst movies i've seen.
