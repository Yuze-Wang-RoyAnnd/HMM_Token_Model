this is a awful re-make of a very good movie called "up in the air" starring frankie darrow, mantan moreland and marjorie reynolds. i was only able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off. almost all the lines are identical, i have no idea why they would re-do the movie. i totally disagree with a previous post that dislikes the songs ( there the same also), in the original the singing is first rate, i'm not sure if marjorie reynolds actually did her own singing, it's hard to tell since the vocals were usually added later, and the songs are very good, surprising in a "b" movie. if you get the chance see the original it's available on dvd. you'll be pleasantly surprised.
