i loved the gorgeous greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. i cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why australian allison turned into french anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. the mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. i saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since i had read the book several times. i recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies i like) who was mostly amazed at how young michael caine and candace bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery.
