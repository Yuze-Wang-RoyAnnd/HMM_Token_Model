yes, it might be not historically accurate(actually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there), and yes, it has some mistakes and exaggeration(bended machine gun? come on! or the that "history lesson" about how afghanistan was never conquered by anyone - educated russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example british campaign in afghanistan). and yes, it does not have multi-million dollars hollywood-style special effects, but it's strongest point in showing soldier's life there, their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes. in my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all those things.<br /><br />again, movie has it weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few years.<br /><br />8/10
