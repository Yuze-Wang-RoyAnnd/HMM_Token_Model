a few of my fellow writers have covered this movie's plot elements so i will stick to some of the cuff remarks...<br /><br />1. this is entertaining - but not for the reasons you'd think. it's cheesy but somehow still watchable.<br /><br />2. tamra, daniel's love interest has to be about thirty. the christian girl that dan ignores is way cuter.<br /><br />3. muriel stole his shirt from mr. spock. also, if my guardian angel looks like muriel i'm going to have to apply for a transfer.<br /><br />4. okay... so apparently... dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! what kind of horrible guilt trip is that?! muriel says that it was dan's prayers that kept his parents together. i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous. listen, i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way they'll stay together is if they decide they're going to do it.<br /><br />5. i'll echo the atheist's comments on how this movie portrays non-christians. apparently they're all slovenly bullies.<br /><br />6. for something positive - david white is a decent actor. he gives the movie a little bit of credibility, even if he is the only one. he pretty much holds this film together on his own.
