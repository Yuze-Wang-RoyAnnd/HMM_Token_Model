aliens let lose a giant monster named zarkorr, then send down a hologram that looks your average stupid teenage girl to tell postman, tommy ward (rhys pugh, in the only movie you ever see him in) that has been chosen to fight. also if he loses the plant goes doom, so he goes off to fight zarkorr the invader! this movie is bad, very bad. so bad it you need negative numbers just to gave it a rattan. horridly written, bad directing, way below power rangers over-the-top wooden acting that you're just whiting for a horde of lumberjacks to come out of no where and cut them down! and don't get me started on the theme song at the end. the people who made this stemming pall of s$@# should not be aloud near a camera or any thing to do with films. zarkorr is a cool looking monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this one. do your self a favour and don't see this movie, it's 80 or so minute of life. the actors that are in this never worked again by way.<br /><br />3/10
