at least it is with this episode. here we have a time traveler, the professor from gilligan's island, no less, going back in time to 1865. what does one do--why try to save lincoln of course! no really interesting variations are rung on this old theme. as another reviewer has stated, this episode is particularly drab and unstylish, with little to suggest that "the professor" really is back in the 1860s. budget limitations are readily apparent, and the direction is stolid. john wilkes booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production. we too often feel we are on stage sets, waiting for something clever to happen. there is a minor twist at the end, but i emphasize minor.
