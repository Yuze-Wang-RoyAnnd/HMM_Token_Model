ok, i did think that it would be horrible. but when i saw it.. i was proven wrong. emily bergl did a superb job as did jason london. sue snell was under-used and under-written. the meanies were ok, dylan bruno and rachel blanchard are definitely the stand-outs. as for the things the teens do and how people claim it's all wrong. whatever. my friends and i use the term "swank" a lot and i have driven a car and had someone steer as i changed. it's pretty much all there. i've just never been at a after-game party in a house that big with it's very own light show.. the deaths are good. the best involves a pair of glasses, a spear gun and a pool.. all in that order. i must say, there will be people who hate it.. but i'm not one of them.
