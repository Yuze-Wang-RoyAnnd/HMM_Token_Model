if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed. i went to the cinema with a group of die-hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn't as funny or dark as the three series before. in my personal opinion it was a money spinner. the writing was contrived and the plot confused - no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do. it was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms. i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series. i will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia.
