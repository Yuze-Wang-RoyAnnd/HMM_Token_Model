i got hold of this film on dvd with the title evil never sleeps, it gives front cover billing to carrie ann moss, but she plays such a minor character that i didn't really notice her in the film.<br /><br />i'm afraid that i consider this one of the worst purchases i have ever made. the dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden, i found the acting to be disconnected from the plot. graham's performance to me was of someone who's wondering whether she's left the gas on at home.<br /><br />all in all both my wife and i found this film painful to watch, and it is not a valuable addition to my collection, watch it at your peril, but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time.
