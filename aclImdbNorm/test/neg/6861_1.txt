was unlucky enough to see this while travelling by coach across africa. it was far and away the worst film i have ever come across. deserves to be the #1 all-time worst ;-) no acting, no plot, very little speaking. lots of ape-like grunting though, in this hopelessly unlikely film. an unwitting self-satire - you'll either laugh at it or cry.
