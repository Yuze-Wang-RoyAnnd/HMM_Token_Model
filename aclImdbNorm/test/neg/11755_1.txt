i know curiosity killed the cat, but i simply had to see the remake of psycho, especially after being on such a hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work. i've watched the original psycho though since i was a kid, i knew how to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent movie! one of the best, in fact! the first thing i said when i heard about the remake was "how do you remake perfection?". i stuck to that as well, but i think i have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing psycho to a new generation.<br /><br />but this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original psycho. i know this has been said, but i watched the making of this film, and the director was like "oh, i just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original"... what's the friggin' point?! ok, but i want to judge this movie on it's own, despite it's insulting blows the original. i mean, the acting wasn't up to par, but honestly, it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy own.<br /><br />watching the making of this film, i wanted to slap anne hasche, she said "i've never seen the original, i just wanted to work with gus." ooh, that made me angry, because frankly, it's not just that, she really sucked in this role as marian, she wasn't convincing, not to mention her shower scene really was horrible. vince vaughn didn't make... let's just put it this way, the film was horribly miscasted. this was a sin against film and on it's own, this was actually a bad movie. it was too much and destroyed what could've been a new introduction for a new generation. but to gus, leave the film making the one's who know what they're doing!<br /><br />1/10
