i had the misfortune to watch this last night on the bbc, i expect i may have been the only viewer. from the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie, after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was. the movie was bad! not bad in a good way like wolfpack or a seagal film just plain old shoddy bad.<br /><br />why was this made into a movie? i've seen a few episodes of the tv series and thought it was alright but i only saw repeats of that because they made this.<br /><br />i spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end i was none the wiser. i seem to remember at some point a character, maybe farina's mentions that the mod squad can get in to places regular cops can't. the 'place' turns out to be a 'club', one of the toughest places to get into, maybe it was student night? i lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other tv series remakes.<br /><br />was it an action comedy? i don't remember any laughs.<br /><br />overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like seymour hoffman as the bad guy. with him ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off.
