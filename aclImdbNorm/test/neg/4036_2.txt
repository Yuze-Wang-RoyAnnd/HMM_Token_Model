i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this "b-movie" in it's entirety.<br /><br />all i have to say is--- save your time and money!!! this has got to be the worst b-movie of all time, it shouldn't even be called a b-movie, more like an f-movie! because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all of the actors are paper-thin and not at all believable, it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it's almost funny.......almost.<br /><br />the movie is just packed full of crappy one-liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit.<br /><br />this movie is supposed to be geared towards men, but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end. they try to appear sexy in those weird, horrible costumes and they fail miserably!!!<br /><br />even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laughs, but this is just too painful to watch!!
