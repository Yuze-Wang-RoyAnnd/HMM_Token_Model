this is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep.<br /><br />utterly boring long silent(yes, silent) strings of unrelated video clips.<br /><br />instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow- it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing arabs being malicious to everyone around them.<br /><br />sulieman (the director) should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film.<br /><br />it deserves a one for the movie quality, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or lack thereof.)
