well now, here's the thing - for this movie to work, you'll have to accept the following - a woman who's murdered is alive again at the end of the movie, a detective stops interrogating the dead woman's fianc'ee because a newspaper reporter asked him not to, and that same reporter, smitten by a good looking blonde hauled into night court for suspicious behavior, winds up getting married to her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook. are you following me on this? i can't tell you how many times i paused and rewound the picture to repeat scenes that just didn't make any sense. in the end, the blonde (claudia dell) and the reporter (richard hemingway) remained married, but i have no idea how they came to that decision. in fact, i can't figure out how the film maker came to the decision to make this flick. oh i suppose there's some entertainment value here for just the sheer nonsense of it all, but it would have been nice if even a couple of the pieces fit. still, i'm not ready to add this one to my top ten worst list. i think that night club scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it. but why was it in the movie? i just don't know.
