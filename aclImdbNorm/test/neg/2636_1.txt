this movie was crap. the script is so full of holes; i can't see how the producers agreed to finance it.<br /><br />we are never given an explanation of anything. the acting is horrible. the plot sucks. this movie was obviously written for those 8 and under.<br /><br />i have to say this: why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long? teacher walks in, finds a frog in the desk, or drawing on the chalkboard, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, class is over. the kids haven't even opened their books. can we have at least a little continuity?<br /><br />oh, the dialogue. milo jeter is the re-incarnated, aborted fetus, zombie thing. do we really need the line, "this is dr. jeter's office. dr. jeter, milo's father." thanks for the tip; i could never put that together myself. it never gets any better.<br /><br />why does milo talk the way he does, even in the beginning? was milo ever `real'. or was he never real, just always what he currently is? and if it was always that way, why the unexplained `accident' milo had?<br /><br />besides "what is milo?", what are all the unresolved items for? we see all these contraptions in his father's medical office, and are never given an explanation of what they are for, or what they have to do with the story. what are the injections for? what about the aquarium contraption? they obviously aren't needed. (see the movie, it'll make sense). and what does this medication do to anyone? apparently nothing, since it has no effect on the lead actress.<br /><br />this movie is a very, very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies. it's a really awful friday the 13th/halloween slopped together by a 10-year old writer. it's not cheesy enough to laugh at, it's just an incredibly frustrating bore.
