were it not for the fact that this came as a 2-dvd set paired with the original american graffiti; were it not for the fact that i've been here in iraq for several months and, at this point, will watch pretty much anything, i would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes. this movie was appallingly bad on so many levels i just don't know where to start. poorly acted, shot, directed, written, scored, edited. my 9-year old daughter's first forays into film-making are superior to this - and she was filming the dog sleeping. (come to think of it, i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars. but i'm biased.) if you have even the slightest appreciation for quality film-making, then avoid this piece of garbage at all costs. no character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in english. i'll not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is.
