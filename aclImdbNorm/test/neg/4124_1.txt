in a nutshell, skip this movie, it's that bad. in short, this movie is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed. because they make bad things, they aren't popular so to speak. a new female ceo comes in to clear things up, and make sure the reputation of the company will be improved. she does this by leaking company confidential information to the press... do you believe this? furthermore she starts to fire people she has never seen. incredible uh? a pacifistic group tries to destroy the company's mainframe, because there are the blueprint located of those secret weapons. this mainframe is located in the bottom of the building hidden in a kind of vault. of course the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot which is the ultimate killer machine, which resembles like an 'alien' from the alien movies. the mad scientist likes the female ceo.<br /><br />the mad scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone, and so protects his job, rise in chain of command, and make the movie interesting. the pacifists team up with the ceo and another person of the board of directors to escape from the robot. further down the line they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe, whilst avoiding the robot. they also discover that the factory was developing a part man, part machine soldier. they can erase a persons memory and replace it by a veteran soldier's one. one of the pacifists is transformed in such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot. i guess the mad scientist also wrote the script of this movie. this super soldier looks and acts much the same as robocop, though not as funny.<br /><br />it boils down to this. people are running, being chased by a killer robot, are hurt by it, but they do not seem to troubled by that, besides limping a bit, and of course the female ceo is the leading character of this movie, and cannot be killed, i.e. survives every attack, explosion, you name it. i won't bother you by the chase, let's skip to the end. they have lots of weapons, yes the pacifist too and they know how to use them. when they're at the roof of the building they empty all there weapons upon the killer robot. they step into an elevator which is used to clean outside windows. and then the female ceo knows some magic as well, at the roof she was complaining about being out of bullets, and like magic the gun is reloaded. this way she can shoot the cables and let the elevator plummet 70 stories or so, and let it stop right above ground surface by pulling the brake. and to top it all off, the police is waiting there for them. the robot jumps after them, and kills the cops. hilarious no? the robot chases them down the vault where the mainframe is, and when finally the robot is so close to her, that he can touch/kill her, it stops. because the mad scientist did not want her to be killed. a better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist. although he is the one who made this movie watchable. at this moment i was already pulling for the killer robot to finish them all of, so the movie would end.<br /><br />i cannot believe that this movie rates this high, and this is why i wrote this comment. avoid this movie like the plague. it's a monster, and i'm not talking about the death machine.
