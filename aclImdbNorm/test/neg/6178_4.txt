i saw the movie after checking its rating on imdb. back then, it was at 8.0 and i thought, "wow! that must be a good one". i thought wrong. the beginning of the movie actually keeps what the plot promises, but then it goes exponentially down underneath its basement. i think without the character of richie nix, it might have been alright - although he is the reason the story line takes the course it does. the character is just too extreme for my liking, and hard to endure. also, the journey the main character takes from the beginning of the story till its "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been omitted - the alternative is, i just did not understand the movie.<br /><br />although i must admit that it is "easy watching", and i had no problems sitting through the whole movie, when it had finished i was somewhat unimpressed by the ending. all in all, rather mediocre.
