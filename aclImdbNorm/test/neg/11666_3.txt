this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen. however, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. i like to compare it to plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that i find myself laughing out loud.<br /><br />one of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of robin hood, and let be honest and say that i love robin hood with errol flynn, and robin hood: men in tights. but let's face it, from the forbidden love between peck (who is definitely slumming it. although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece to kill a mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgettable, apparently, that i have forgotten her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams "robin hood" all over it.<br /><br />however, i don't think the film isn't worth seeing. on the contrary, i think that this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years, even if it was unintentional.
