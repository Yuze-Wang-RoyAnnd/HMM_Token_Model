grosse pointe blank was really quite a below average film. its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. the acting is very normal. the performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. the whole reunion and the 'wow, i haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them. it just all seemed very tacky, pointless and was poorly executed. <br /><br />dan akroyd's role as a 'rival' assassin is very sparse. he only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a 'final show down' which is hugely hyped up but doesn't deliver at all.<br /><br />the soundtrack is also very mediocre. the bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the 1980's and with the exception of two or three, are very bad. hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this film.<br /><br />i could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly, the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department, the way that half the time you forget that cusak's character is even a hit man at all as the element is so non-existent.<br /><br />even the way the comedy thinks it's funny; but it isn't. i didn't laugh once during this movie. sure, maybe i smirked now and again but my only real feel good point was when i realised the movie was nearly over!<br /><br />please, don't waste your time with 'grosse pointe blank' despite the relatively high (but badly incorrect) imdb rating. i've seen films that are better than this film that have lower rating on this site which tells you that there are better films out there. just don't bother with this one.
