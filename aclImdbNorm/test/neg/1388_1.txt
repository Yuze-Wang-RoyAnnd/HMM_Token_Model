...if you've been laughing too much for a long time, and need to take a break.<br /><br />after reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself. everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true. mind of mencia is like a half hour version of mad tv, but with somehow worse jokes.<br /><br />one skit i had the displeasure of watching was "the second annual stereotype olympics". what's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming, or gay guy named "sparkles" that wins a banana eating contest? neither of these concepts is particularly novel, insightful, or amusing. do we really need a joke about star wars every episode? that movie came out like 30 years ago. mencia's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about hispanics and throw a few "beaners" in there; and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money. pure comedic genius.<br /><br />then he blatantly ripped off jeff foxworthy on a second show i watched, with a "your gay if..." bit. you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a ryan-seacrest-is-gay joke. it's not like either of those has already been done to death.<br /><br />unless you're a big fan of jason friedberg and adam seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. especially when there are authentic comedians like dave chappelle out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful.
