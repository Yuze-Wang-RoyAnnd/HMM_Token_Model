i know that full moon, or any other film studio for that matter, could never recapture the fun and cheesy sci-fi feeling that was the original `trancers.' and with the last two entries in the series having jack deth in medieval times instead of futuristic los angeles, it became quite obvious that there really was little hope in reviving the trancers series. breathing new life into a film is one thing, but taking our main character out of his element and putting him into the past, well, it didn't work! so now with trancers 6, full moon has breathed so much new life into the series that we don't even deal with jack deth any more. we now deal with his daughter, jo. jack is in her body and must go into the past and fight the trancers one more time.<br /><br />*minor spoiler: first scene of the film revealed*<br /><br />	to prove how bad this movie is, you only need watch the first two minutes of the film when the original jack deth appears on the screen. but it's not actually tim thomerson. it's clips of him and sound bytes strung together (trust me, you can tell they're strung together) horribly to provide the viewer the last of the true jack deth humor. and from this point on, things only go down hill. having this girl, jo deth, as our main character while jack deth is supposed to be in her body, is the worst idea in the world. having this cute young woman act as a rough and tough man isn't the right track at all! it doesn't work and it really comes off as foolish.<br /><br />	i'm not going to go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most reading this know what full moon has become: a really, really, low budget enterprise. i don't know what to say about this movie, except i really wish full moon could be like it was in the days of demonic toys, puppet master, and trancers 1. back then, while the special effects weren't great, the story telling was. they made serious b-movies for serious b movie and horror fans, and that just doesn't take place today with the new full moon studios. i yearn for the good ol' days, and truly hope, that full moon can pull itself out of this horrible slump that they're in right now.<br /><br />	trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10.
