first of all, this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it, since i myself did not understand this horrible story. further, the unknown cast, leaded by an actress called laura mennell, is simply awful. the expressions and screams of the character sara tobias are laughable and ridiculous, confusing grimaces with acting. last but not the least, there are many favorable reviews about this flick in imdb as follows:<br /><br />- top notch- can't wait to see more of the directors work
