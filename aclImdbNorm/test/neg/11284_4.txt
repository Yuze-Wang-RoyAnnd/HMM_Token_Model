i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for oscar, my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it. and i really found what i expected; a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in turkey, trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all. but it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody, therefore film stays as average for all.<br /><br />whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours. to fit the short story in a full movie length, some scenes are added without a connection with the main story. these are mostly the ice-cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people (i.e. goat herdsman, old women etc.), and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs. the subject is mentioned as a universal problem: struggle of a local producer-tradesman against holding companies and monopoly, but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before. most of the readers will remember the "hero grocer against supermarket" from ferhan sensoy in 1980's. this was the correct story at correct time. shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now.<br /><br />except some gibbers due to local accent, the performance of cast is so successful. the leading role is played by turan ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too.<br /><br />on the other hand against limited budget, appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film. but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo-realists or worth to be oscar nominee.<br /><br />note: in the real life, normally the ice-cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of manda brand.
