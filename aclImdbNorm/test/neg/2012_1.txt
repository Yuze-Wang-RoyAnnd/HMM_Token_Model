oh dear gods, this is awful. stay away, just stay away. if you think you've seen bad movies, think again. never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after i watched this movie. the acting, if it is allowed to be called that, is enough to cause internal bleedings inside your head. the story is so thin it is just barely there... no wait, scratch that. there is not a complete story there, but once in a while, there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of horribleness, and believe me, those few lines should have been shot. the best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it, and watch the cozy fire from a distance.<br /><br />some may call me sarcastic in this review, but i am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache. however, should you be, what i like to call, a visual masochist (like myself), please, go right ahead and watch this monstrosity.
