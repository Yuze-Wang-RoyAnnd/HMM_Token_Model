i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film". i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i.q. points for each passing second. i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on. imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.
