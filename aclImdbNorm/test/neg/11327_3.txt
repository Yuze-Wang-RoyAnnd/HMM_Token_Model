it's boring.<br /><br />it's slow.<br /><br />where are the nasty and brutal murders? where is the tension that is supposed to scare us? this is like watching sesame street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or grover.<br /><br />it's really lame.<br /><br />maybe it was the writing...maybe the direction...maybe the acting, maybe the editing, maybe the cinematography, maybe the special effects, maybe the makeup.<br /><br />maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on.<br /><br />i wanted to get scared...not bored.<br /><br />this didn't scare me...it didn't even interest me...i had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this film.<br /><br />don't bother to buy it..and if you see it on television by some freak chance, there is no need to tuck the kids asleep.
