i was waiting to welcome arnold schwarzeneger's return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after "eraser." "end of days," however, can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in.<br /><br />"end of days" starts well with a gripping action sequence, yet quickly becomes a bore, taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium (read "doomsday"). <br /><br />performances are stale, special effects so-so, and gore plentiful. considering myself a die-hard schwarzenegger fan, i couldn't believe i didn't like this film, but with such an awful, lame script, what could arnie have done, besides passed on this turkey?<br /><br />3 out of 10<br /><br />
