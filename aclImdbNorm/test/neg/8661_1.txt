as a fan of nearly any period drama, and at that a huge jane austen fan, i was horrified by this adaption. as a fan of the 1999 version of mansfield park, i was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short. it felt hugely rushed and very one-dimensional so that it became boring very quickly. there seemed to be no subtly to the relationships, particularly that of fanny and edmund, and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location. despite having looked forward to the jane austen season since christmas i turned this off after an hour and went to bed. i will be interested to watch the adaptations of persuasion and northanger abbey, of which i have no much-loved version, to see if they still manage to bore me in such a manner.
