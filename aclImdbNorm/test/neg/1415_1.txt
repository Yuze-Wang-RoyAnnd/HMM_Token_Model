i am pretty surprised to see that this movie earned even lukewarm reviews, i found this movie downright awful. the plot flounders around trying to decide if it is a comedy or a thriller, then realizes it cannot achieve either. so it throws in the towel and continues with its absurd plot highlighted with a unintentional hilarious scene with laura linney, an injection, and spilled coffee that leaves the audience awkwardly squirming in their seats looking at one another like is this for real? basically it is abysmal and really disappointing for robin williams fans, and it makes you think someone blackmailed laura linney into adding this piece of trash to her otherwise respectable resume. i wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish i had, even seeing it for free i wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time. the computer glitch/twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and by the end you don't care who wins the election. i vote for straight to dvd.
