** black dragons (1942) william nigh ~ bela lugosi, joan barclay, clayton moore <br /><br />"just prior to the start of world war ii, dr. melcher (bela lugosi), a world-famous surgeon, is brought in by japan's black dragon society as part of a secret plan. dr. melcher operates on six black dragon society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking american businessmen who are replaced by these look-alikes. with their operatives in place, the black dragon society's plan to sabotage the american war effort appears to be set but, the f.b.i. chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />that synopsis gives away the entire ending; which, in this case, might be a good thing. "black dragons" is an incredible, wildly inconsistent muddle. a wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle. in early scenes, mr. lugosi (as monsieur colomb) is effectively creepy. confusing joan barclay (as alice saunders), future "lone ranger" clayton moore (as dick martin), along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along.
