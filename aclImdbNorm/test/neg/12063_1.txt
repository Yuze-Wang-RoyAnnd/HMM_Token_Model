camp blood looked great when i was buying it, but when i watched it boy was i wrong. its tacky, the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking. being a movie fan, i usually find humour from tragic horror, but at times i couldn't even laugh. maybe camp blood 2 will be an improvement.
