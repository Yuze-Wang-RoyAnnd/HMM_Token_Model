this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies i've ever seen. i'm seriously considering buying a copy, if i can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. it's honestly that bad. i view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. if you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. just to be fair, kelsey grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite. other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful, but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies. i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst, but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top, and the movie doesn't even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way. if you are familiar with the term "word vomit" then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity. oh, and the narrative structure is ill conceived, pretentious and amateurish. it has failed on both style and substance. if you really hate someone, invite them over for a double feature of this movie and "the terror of tiny town," an all midget western from the 1930's and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open "a clockwork orange" style. but that probably violates some provision in the geneva conventions.
