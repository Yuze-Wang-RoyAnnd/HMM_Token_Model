there are spoilers but trust me, i'm doing you a favor.<br /><br />my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often. inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes; we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact...not worth watching. however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. and i am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags. so, as another reviewer has said, films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. i prefer the idea of; instead of straight to video you have straight to internet. that way the ass-bags who made this travesty won't ever turn a profit. which unfortunately you know they do. they hire a bunch of actors who can't act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o, and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping mexicans who only speak spanish, to arabs to being 100% fluent in english, random nudity, a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. the fact that i actually predicted that the jell-o puking snake girl would actually transform into a snake about half way through terrifies me...<br /><br />anyways, the movie is great to make fun of, but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire, because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off, you will feel physically ill. i kid you not. my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of sh!t.<br /><br />this film is one above alien vs. hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made. and i've seen lots of bad movies. incidentally, it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well. just thought you might like to know that little fun fact. -100 out 0f 10.
