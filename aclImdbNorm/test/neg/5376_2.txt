i suppose i should be fair and point out that i don't believe in ghosts. that said, i'm very interested in the subject and i enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy. i am a fan of ghost hunters because they at least try to give their investigations a scientific angle. even early episodes of most haunted had a camp entertainment factor to them. paranormal state has neither of these qualities. the cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much "reality tv" these days, it suffers from overproduction, poor acting and silly scripts. the makers of the show freely admit that writers "guide" the stories. i hear they are even going to shoehorn in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female demographic. the show has many other flaws too. as others have stated, the narration quickly becomes like nails down a chalkboard. over the top visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating. i'm willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of entertainment, but this whole "demon with a vendetta" story arc is just ridiculous. given that the producers of this show are also responsible for brain dead fodder like mtv's laguna beach and newport harbor i suppose this is really no surprise. if you are a die hard fan of ed & lorraine warren or a big "reality" show junkie i guess you'll find much to like in paranormal state. for the rest of us....i recommend you avoid.
