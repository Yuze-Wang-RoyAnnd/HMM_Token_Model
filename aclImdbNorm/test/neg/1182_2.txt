i stopped watching this film half way through. it was just terrible! boring, contrived subplots. a complete lack of the pathos seen in norman bates, buffalo bill, or steve railsback's portrayal of ed gein. a movie doesn't have to be historically accurate, but the true story of ed gein is so much more interesting than this third-rate melodrama that was completely made up for no good reason! ed gein as portrayed by kane hodder is a cartoon sadist. the attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak exercises in recycled style. and this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even screwed that up. fortunately, there is a better film of this story. 2001's ed gein told the story efficiently, and offered a few real chills as we watched a sick man not in control of himself. steve railsback, who played ed gein that time, was already famous for memorably portraying another famous serial killer: charles manson. his ed had pathos. his film is the one to see. avoid this mess.
