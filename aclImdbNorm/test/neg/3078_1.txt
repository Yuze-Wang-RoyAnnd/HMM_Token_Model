more of a character study then a movie, committed is yet just another relationship romp with the trimmings specifically made for a young, target audience. the direction seems very basic, with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser versus the clueless committed. committed is watchable at times and there is a small feeling of originality from lisa krueger.<br /><br />committed is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. we get to know joline but the movie picks up when her husband disappears. joline sets off to find him.<br /><br />some parts are strange. other times the movie drags. the second half is more humorous as we see joline's spiritual antics take a turn for the more intense. the annoying guitar music is awful, but perhaps a necessary evil as committed offers very little anyway. an average movie hampered by some completely pointless moments, committed 's only asset is heather graham and patricia velazquez.
