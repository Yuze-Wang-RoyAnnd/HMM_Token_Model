so, as far as i gather, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people, and this is just as scary as the paranormal. the "paranormal" imagery associated with the villain, donnie, is purely symbolic. he's actually just a normal human being.<br /><br />the problem is that i just don't buy it. donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal. he's not even that scary at all. as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has only newly become a murderer, he's significantly less disturbing than most well-known real-life serial killers (eg: he's like a very watered-down version of ed gein). which is why scully's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off (something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine), before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all, is completely out of character. she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches.<br /><br />so, as comic book guy says... "worst episode ever!"
