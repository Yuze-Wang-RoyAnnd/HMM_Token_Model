or at least forceable retirement! this movie is awful, horrible, terrible, rank, rotten, putrid... well, you get the idea. do not under any circumstances watch this piece of decaying garbage unless you have a death wish, because it's sure to kill you. (i only survived because i missed the first half hour.) carrot top is a bad comedian, and an even worse actor. i cannot believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money. it just goes to show that some people have no scruples if they think they might make a buck or two (literally... i can't imagine this made more than $2!).<br /><br />and someone please tell me what possible motivation courtney thorne smith (a halfway decent actress, certainly above this at any rate) had for signing onto this steaming pile of dung. was she that bored during that 3.5 second dry spell between melrose place and ally mcbeal? or did she owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet (aka carrot top)?<br /><br />i give this a 2/10, and that's probably way too high. i try to save my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since i didn't see all of this one my stomach contents thankfully stayed contained. i don't think i'll be watching it again to find out if it's really worth a 1!
