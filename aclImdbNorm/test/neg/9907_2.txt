the only reason i know this film exists is because i wanted to see what nancy mckeon had been up to since the facts of life ended. when i searched her name, up came this relatively new tv movie. after much investigation i managed to locate a copy & was thoroughly disappointed with what i viewed. d grade acting, poor script, terrible fx - it was like watching a toned down, more stupefied version of day after tomorrow that went for 3 hours. despite the long running time the characters remain fairly under-developed, we do not care about them in the slightest & in most cases are longing for their demise. combine that with terrible lighting & cinematography & you have a real disaster of a film. how they con-viced so many "name" actors (i.e dianne weist, randy quaid, brian dennehy) to appear in such trash is mind-blowing. in summary - i want those 3 hours of my life back!!!
