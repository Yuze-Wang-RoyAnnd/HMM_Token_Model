while killing time on a saturday morning, "looking for lola" came on hbo. i decided to give it a shot even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad. it was even worse than i could imagine. the movie was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no on-screen chemistry between the lead actors that i found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. between mike greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes in which he skips the bill at a fancy restaurant and where lola (lead actress) allows him to use her boss' house to fool his parents into thinking he's rich, it was almost as bad as him "daydreaming" about people around him doing the macarena (it was horrible!) and the two actors ultimately falling in love. i kept wanting to change the channel, but i was trying to give it every chance into becoming a cute love story with a few chuckles. it never did. in fact, it became so bad that i decided to finish it just so i can claim that i watched one of the worst films ever made in it's entirety, instead of being criticized for not "giving it a fair chance". the last scene where lola tries out for a dance part was the culmination of the movie. she comes in late after getting married (even that scene where mike tells the priest to hurry up and then just snatches the papers away claiming that it's done was in tune with the believability of this movie), and then somehow "convinces" the judges to give her a look. the two male judges are already put-off with how late she is. but after watching her waif around the stage (ok, she dances fine, but not overly impressive), everybody joins in including lola and mike's families, other dancers that were there, and *cough* even the judges. bad, horrible, terrible. it was so bad i had to write a review. watch at your own risk.
