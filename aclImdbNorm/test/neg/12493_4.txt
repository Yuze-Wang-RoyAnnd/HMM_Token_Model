yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the classic "godfather" and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus. sarkar, the 13th hindi film of ram gopal varma as director is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-satya and company. the charisma, the magnetic persona of the two bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which varma should be applauded. however, the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film. reason-the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp. the villains represent the typical bollywood baddies. a character who attracts attention is elder son played by kaykay but again not able to hold due to half-baked characterization. . the drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of close-shots, which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance. the haunting score (amar mohile) and the sound design (kunal mehta, parikshit lalwani & anup dev), together with dark, murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images (camerawork by amit roy) contributes to visuals so typical of ramu's style. but there is an overuse of music though fortunately no songs are there in the film. but can interest of today's "intelligently growing" audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong visuals ? i don't think so. surely, audience "maangey more" and here film fails to deliver. in any adaptation, in order to add a new dimension, the biggest pre-requisite is the screenplay, which is sluggish here not being crisp at places, and therefore the pace slackens quite often. what finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable, very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements. top stunt director allan amin ghani is also not in his best form. some scenes which require a different treatment includes- a minister is talking foul about sarkar and the son is overhearing; a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on sarkar, sarkar jr. escapes from the clutches of his enemies, a son easily motivated to kill his own father, a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him, a police commissioner slapping sarkar jr-all this requires a more realistic, hard-hitting approach which is the back-bone to create the required conflict. the dialogues are weak for eg. look at an amateurish line where a cm says to sarkar jr.
