this movie starts out the way every movie should start out, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies and/or topless. a couple of them take showers. i'm liking it so far! unfortunately, we then meet or main characters. they're just not particularly likable. usually in these movies, the actresses aren't really acting, they give very "natural" performances, and they're quite sympathetic, fun, and likable. not here. they don't have much of any personality and i didn't care for them much.<br /><br />some of the girls go on a camping trip for school. on the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang. the biker gang should really have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it's just plain stupid. the head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as john bon jovi for halloween. the girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them.<br /><br />i don't really know what the heck happens after that. there's a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it's the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious indian dude who keeps disappearing. somebody gets eaten by a cheesy lock ness monster thing as he's swimming across a lake. some guy in silly makeup is apparently a druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world. or maybe cause the end of the world, i'm afraid i wasn't paying much attention. first he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie.<br /><br />it could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn't even live up to my grade z schlock expectations. they really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things. instead it's all over the place. overall, if you're looking for late '80 schlock, i imagine you could do worse. if you tried really hard. there's plenty of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.
