thank god you're here is painful, positively painful. the title is apt, in a sense, if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the marx brothers. and trust me, they are paid.<br /><br />as creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become, i refuse to believe that nbc brass really have faith in this turkey. rather, i think thank god you're here is what all of you get who didn't watch, or didn't appreciate studio 60, which previously graced the peacock network's monday night lineup. you want to turn your nose up at caviar, fine. here's some lovely alpo direct from menu foods for you to slop around in.
