unspeakable starts in los angeles with jim (roger cline) & his wife alice fhelleps (tamera noll) arguing as they drive along in the pouring rain, unfortunately jim crashes the car & his daughter heather (leigh silver) ends up dead while alice is turned into a wheelchair bound vegetable. devastated by the death of his daughter jim starts visiting prostitutes, he then kills them because of voices in his head. erm, that's it really.<br /><br />written, produced & directed by chad ferrin i hate unspeakable as a film. there are some films you occasionally see that move the 'goal posts' as it were in regard to everything you watch thereafter, some films are so brilliant that all other's will be judged by it while other's like unspeakable for example are so bad that it sets a new cinematic low. this is truly one of the worst films i've ever seen & i am seriously surprised by the largely positive comments on the imdb although i'm not surprised the the low overall rating on the main page, i not sure if i missed something but for a start unspeakable has no plot, it has no story & a lot of it seems almost random. there was nothing in unspeakable to maintain my interest or entertain & as a result became a test of endurance to get through to the end. the film tries to be shocking with some limp scenes of sexual abuse of a rent boy by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person craps herself, it splats on the floor & her dodgy male nurse starts feeling her soiled genitals, legs & underwear. if anyone can find such crap entertaining then i'll just cut my wrists now, the character's are some of the worst i've had the misfortune to know, the dialogue is hilariously bad with some it sounding like it came straight from some dirty faggot porno of the worst kind. it doesn't work as a horror as it's not scary in the slightest, it's absolutely hilarious & frankly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone suffering a great loss & attempting to cope with it & overall i just think it's a pointless, rubbishy, badly made piece of crap from troma.<br /><br />director ferrin films like some badly made documentary, the special effects are terrible & are of the 'let's pour tomato ketchup on our actor's face & the audience will be convinced that they died a gory death' variety, there is no graphic violence at all apart from a suicide where someone sticks a knife in their own mouth. considering the amount of prostitutes in unspeakable the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum...<br /><br />apparently unspeakable had a budget of about $20,000 & all i can say is where did all the money go? oh, a quick note to the filmmakers, if your going to record sound live make sure you don't have your actor's deliver their lines next to a main road that half of los angeles seem to be driving up... the acting sucks, period.<br /><br />unspeakable is, in my opinion, total crap. it's probably not the worst i've ever seen but it's right down there & i can't remember seeing such a awful film recently. one to avoid unless your a masochist or insomniac.
