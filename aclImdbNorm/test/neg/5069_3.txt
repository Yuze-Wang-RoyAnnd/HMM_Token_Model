i've come to realise through watching this sort of film that i don't like them very much. caged women is yet another 'women in prison' film, and like the most of the rest of the genre; the plot is completely forsaken in favour of simply showing nude women. now don't get me wrong; i love nude women, but i also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity, and since this film has only the basic 'women are in prison' theme running through it (aswell as the essential escape, of course), i got a bit bored before the end. the film is good because there's barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes, but that's about the only positive element. director (and writer, ha ha) erwin c. dietrich delights in showing close-ups of the naked female body, but it's never very erotic. the director was the producer on a number of trash flicks, including some directed by jess franco. in my opinion, he should stick to producing as his writing talents are non-existent, and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene. this sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time, but i reckon franco could have made more out of it. overall, this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff; but i can't say i enjoyed it.
