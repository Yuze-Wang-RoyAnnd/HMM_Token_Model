as a true canadian, i always avoid canadian movies. however now and then i get trapped into watching one. this one is better than most, which is to say mediocre. it has many of the usual flaws of canadian films...self-conscious acting...an excess of cinematic gimmicks and, above all, the self-effacing canadian habit of using canadian cities as stand-ins for american ones. i mean using the historic metropolis of montreal as a stand in for harrisburg pennsylvania is just short of obscene. i was in a generous mood. i gave it a 4.<br /><br />
