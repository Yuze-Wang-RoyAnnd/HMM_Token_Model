nothing will ever top komodo with the lovely jill hennessey as a shrink (!), but kvc ain't quite as bad as i expected for a syfy channel quickie. just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned, or while trying to go to sleep. the unimaginative title basically says it all: a group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken over the island and eaten everyone. so now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people being there. the acting is wonderfully atrocious, especially a mustachioed general right out of the incredible hulk tv series, but this is typical of this kind of made-for-cable schlock. the cgi creatures are tv-level quality, which means you know you're watching cartoon monsters. however, two of the gals in the group are very cute, and worth watching as they run here and there in their tight little outfits. you just want to eat them up!
