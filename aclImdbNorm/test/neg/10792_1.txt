the plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the african jungle/ plains.its a turkey and the some. what it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent(to the release) footage of men on a safari. there are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, south seas natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of africa), women in bikini's, horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body (racially insensitive i think so). this is a movie to sit and make fun of- but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. at any other time this is going to be a chore to get through. its a bad bad bad movie. beyond that i'm speechless
