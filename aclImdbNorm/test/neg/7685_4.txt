ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a "big-screen-opus". citizen kane - a similar work in many ways - is quite the opposite (in the way we come to expect such fare) in that it has lots of location shooting for example.<br /><br />acting is meant to convey a character's motivations and thinking to the audience; if it succeeds in making you understand the character, what does it matter how it was done? and considering the low amount of action, how else is one to express events that influence the story, and consequently the characters' machinations and decisions other than "exaggerated movements"?<br /><br />as well, there's a historical level why the acting style should not surprise. the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced film-makers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how. as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinema's evolution and techniques, they only used what they knew.<br /><br />the nazi's control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the 1920's, due to their total control over that film industry. and propaganda films can only "entertain" german troops so much; hence the need for popular german silent films of the 1920's, for example. so a lot of ivan the terrible film's techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew (as mentioned in other comments).<br /><br />there was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found over-hyped, it is by no means a bad cinematic experience - and definitely not amongst the worse films ever. the acting is fine, and part of the cinematography excellent (even by today's standards; more below). definitely not a popcorn flick; one can't leave their brain outside this one's door. dated perhaps and very symbolic - only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home, for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films' chiefly b&w experience. it all depends upon what expectations one walks in with...<br /><br />warning - spoilers: do not read the following comments, in case they influence your personal view of the film(s).<br /><br />...and if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). for ivan is how stalin saw himself - obvious in his influence on the film's direction (see other comments) - and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this. maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin, or maybe not; this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations, decisions, loneliness, promotions of lackeys, etc - using the persona of ivan - than any true historical record of ivan. also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel: red (for the ussr) in the banquet scene. and perhaps blue (for the usa) during certain shots when the usurper wears the crown?<br /><br />but it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows, or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivan's return to moscow.
