*hannibal spoilers* hannibal lecter (anthony hopkins) is back... for a travesty of a movie! now he's in italy, appreciating our food (including people, such as rinaldo pazzi (giancarlo giannini)), but comes back to the states for clarice (julianne moore) and to even the score with a former victim, mason verger (gary oldman).<br /><br />let me tell you, this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with silence of the lambs and manhunter, because it's truly, completely, absolutely, totally bad.<br /><br />i mean, the scene near the end with ray liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain saut'eed? wtf? then, why the hell was everybody so annoying (including clarice)? and why did the story keep going nowhere? i suppose that this is the 'teen' chapter of the hannibal series; terrible, stupid, gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing.<br /><br />don't watch it, especially if you love any other of the hannibal movies (sotl, manhunter, red dragon, hannibal rising).<br /><br />hannibal: 1/10.
