as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church ! <br /><br />anyway, movie had a good b movie sci-fi beginning, everything was there to make a good entertaining , easy to watch movie, then everything felt in this religious jesus-will-save-everyone brainwashing mode.<br /><br />story start with 2 main characters, 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con-descendant attitude.<br /><br />in a few words: this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes<br /><br />waste of time, waste of money... avoid it
