i watched this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent, otherwise there is no way i'd have watched it all the way through. the first scene wherein a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seemingly get electrocuted by various slow moving weapons wielded by an even slower moving van helsing wannabe... in black and white... with a voice over, sets the pace for the entire rest of the film. the fight scenes look ridiculous, the dialouge would be funny if the acting wasn't so bad, what passes for plot doesn't make sense, and the production values bite (from the pleather knock off of spike's coat worn by the hero to the cheesy cheap magician's cape their lead vamp swooshes around).<br /><br />i've seen some bad movies (check out the magic sword with b. rathbone, or the raven with a very young jack n.), but this one gets my vote for worst of all times.
