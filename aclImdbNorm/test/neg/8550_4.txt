you belong to me was the final teaming of henry fonda and barbara stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for fonda to columbia pictures. fonda had signed a contract with 20th century fox in order to get the tom joad part in the grapes of wrath. but after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at fox.<br /><br />but the rule was broken here. though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to charles pike from the lady eve, this film isn't anywhere near as funny. in fact feminists would probably be aghast at it. <br /><br />in fact barbara stanwyck herself didn't like it at all. she liked working with henry fonda right enough, but thought this film was ridiculous. as well she should have.<br /><br />fonda is another millionaire playboy, who we would now call a trust fund baby who doesn't really do much with his life. he's sort of lovable lunkhead who meets stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off. turns out she's a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married. <br /><br />but it turns out fonda has a jealous streak, especially when it involves roger clark, another millionaire patient of stanwyck's. and he's not understanding as to her professional obligations.<br /><br />stanwyck, like bette davis and katharine hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. when she tells fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it, fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store. she's so proud of him, that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his salesman's salary.<br /><br />today now would be picketing the film. stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance, probably because she didn't believe any of it. i certainly couldn't. <br /><br />i don't think even back then audiences believed it either. but the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best, but this one was a thanksgiving special.
