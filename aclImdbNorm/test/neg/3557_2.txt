i watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and i won't make that mistake again.<br /><br />the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy, but you don't see what it is. flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. when the ending is finally reveled, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn't happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. the only connection these people have is that they have all had a "bad day"--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom.<br /><br />if this was supposed to be a "crash" clone, it's a complete failure.
