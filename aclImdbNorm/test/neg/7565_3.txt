jeez, this was immensely boring. the leading man (christian schoyen) has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen. and another thing, if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years, he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here. or to say it in my own language "skikkelig gebrokkent". but it is cool to see norwegian dudes in a movie made in hollywood. it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks. the storyline itself is below mediocre. i have a suspicion that christian schoyen did this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the film by humping one beautiful babe after another.
