regardless of what anyone says, its a b-movie, and the effects are poorly done.. if you're a vampire fanatic, i suppose it would be ok, not 10 out of 10, you others here cant sincerely mean that?. we are to view this as a movie, not read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important, as well as the story. the story are good, but it doesn't carry the film, no wonder it has a low rating over all. i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb, but got severely disappointed. don't get me wrong, i thought the blade movies was awesome, and loved the underworld movies, but this characters aren't close. the make up on the vampires is poorly done, and the effects are worse. this sucks. i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was. the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think this is awesome, you don't care about acting or make up. this is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for an ok story..
