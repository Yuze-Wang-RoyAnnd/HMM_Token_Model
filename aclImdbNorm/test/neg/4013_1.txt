this video has audio that is meant for someone to hear during their sleep. and the same can be said for the video.<br /><br />morgan and his wife pretending to rough it at minimum wage jobs? with a camera rolling? and his little wifey-poo complaining? give me a break. they are both rich. they are sitting in their fake $350/month apartment filming this with their $1,000/month each video crew of 12.<br /><br />i used to respect morgan, but now his "30 days" experience is nothing more than trying to fool any volunteer viewers who are willing to be fooled.<br /><br />c'mon morgan, you are being filmed doing a $6.00 an hour job and you are being paid by naive employers who don't see those big cameras filming the whole thing?? and we aren't to think they aren't paying you under the table?
