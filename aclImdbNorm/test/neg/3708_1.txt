its a sin how these things are made, but then again we wouldn't get to see the best "dummy scene" ever filmed. ahhh the beauty of low budget bigfoot flicks, you lean to see the beauty the more you watch them, thats if your brain doesn't melt first. as i said before, this has the best dummy scene ever! words cant express it, you have to see it for yourself. wonderful lines such as "smells like decain flesh", "thems human..."(you will know this one when you see it) the creature makes a blah, blah! sound and the scene where the baby gets shot will make you cry(with laughter) you will be rewinding it. has a car chase, snowmobile chase, a bigfoot folk song as well as a disco song. it dosn't end there, while watching the credits a friend noticed "wardrobe provided by k-mart". you ask, how could you even get as far as the credits and then watch them? i could only explain this as a sort of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted you cant move and also i guess you have to know who was behind the mess. all that being said, this is a must see especially if you want to punish yourself mentally. its a keeper!
