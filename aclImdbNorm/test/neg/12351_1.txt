i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seen.<br /><br />completely unfunny, low budget, boring, rubbish script, terrible acting - the entire audience (young and old) sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it... there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire movie<br /><br />many people left halfway - can't blame them... i stayed thinking that the film would pick up, however, it never did and i wish i'd left. <br /><br />the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen. i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all - it just wasn't funny. the people who made this movie really don't deserve your money, so please don't pay to see this film.<br /><br />this isn't even funny enough to be shown on tv, let alone cinema...<br /><br />i wanted to give it 0 out of 10, but the system won't allow it...
