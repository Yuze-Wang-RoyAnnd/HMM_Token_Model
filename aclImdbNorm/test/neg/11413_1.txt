as embarrassing as it is to admit, i was listed as production manager on this film... my very first! as a matter of fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. watch carefully, and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes, as a soon-to-be-murdered asylum attendant named... "cely" (my own last name).<br /><br />originally titled "hostages" this picture was changed to "another son of sam" by the producer-director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time. nothing could have helped. i don't even think this picture was good enough to be shown on "mst 3k!"<br /><br />the film was shot primarily with a collection of old mitchell cameras and early arriflex hand held cameras. matter of fact, the shot of the helicopter during the hostage siege was filmed with my own wwii era arri. the picture was filmed entirely in charlotte and belmont, north carolina in the mid seventies. most of the "stars" were local tv newscasters, and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or gullible enough to believe former stuntman and producer-director, dave a, adams' delusions of adequacy.<br /><br />if you enjoy watching this kind of picture, you might love the work of another north carolinian, the legendary earl owensby.<br /><br />
