well, this was my first imax experience so i was pretty blown away about that, primarily; although with hindsight, i can't help wishing that it had been some other (less monochrome)film.<br /><br />magnificent desolation very much had the "programme for schools" feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a lot like reading national geographic magazine in 3d. weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some powerpoint presentation. there was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens; seemingly at your feel, that had a bit of a wow factor but to be honest, that may have had more to do with me being an imax virgin.<br /><br />the commentary, provided by tom hanks, i personally found very, (what's a nice way to put it??) "flag-wavingly nationalistic" which didn't go down too well in central london, judging by remarks overheard as we left.<br /><br />over all, i loved the imax experience, but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day. the moon isn't a particularly colourful subject and to be honest, a lot of the 3d effects were lost in the monochrome scenery. all that would have been well, were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with american schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit
