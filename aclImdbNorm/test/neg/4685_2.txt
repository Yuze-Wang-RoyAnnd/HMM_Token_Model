the word "boring" gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low-budget horror movie might, or might not be. i've seen many a b-movie. many horrible, terribly inept b-movies. some with a production value of a few hundred bucks. does ineptness, lousy acting, worse continuity, and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable? some would no doubt way yes. most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix. well, i hate big-budget movies, so i say no. bad can sometimes be funny (blood freak), sometimes even mind-blowing (troll 2), but boring will always be unwatchable... hey, kinda like bloodthirsty butchers, which reminds me, i'm writing a review for this pile of garbage... uh, yeah, anyway. this is one of late british director andy milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills. this one is based on sweeney todd... great. milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to "butcher" it. hey, that's pretty funny, i said bu... sorry, i keep getting distracted. this isn't exactly easy. on second thought, i'll make it easy. no gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unlikeable, annoying people having incoherent conversations. that's bloodthirsty butchers. oh yeah, and something about a barber killing people, and something or other about meat pies. i don't know, it's not important.<br /><br />for something a little more rewarding from andy milligan, there's always the only other one i've seen, the rats are coming, the werewolves are here. yeah, you heard me. but hows about we forget about this milligan guy all together, and pick up something sweet like sick girl or teenape goes to camp. whatever you decide, just know, bloodthirsty butchers sucks, possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale. and that, b-movie fans, is really saying something. 2/10
