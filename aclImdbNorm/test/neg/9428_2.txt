this film reeks of production line planning. it appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies, and threw spaghetti on the screen - jimmy stewart! june allyson! anthony mann! baseball! war! baby! airplane! - roll 'em! - the film does address the age of the stewart/allyson performers; though, i'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.<br /><br />there are messages in "strategic air command" i found curiously shocking and offensive, but i'll stick with one truly wretched element: the happily married couple is challenged when mr. stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife. in the film's most dramatic scene, she calls him on it. it ends completely unresolved - allyson is crying her heart out on their bed, and stewart walks out on her. no discussion; he simply says he is correct, and walks out on his devastated wife. for all he knows, she could slit her wrists.<br /><br />later, allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision.<br /><br />unbelievable! <br /><br />stick with stewart-allyson in "the stratton story" (1949). <br /><br />** strategic air command (3/25/55) anthony mann ~ james stewart, june allyson, frank lovejoy
