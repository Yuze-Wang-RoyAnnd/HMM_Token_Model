after i couldn't ignore the hype about the show, i started watching season one and it struck me as really good and i was hooked.... for about 5 episodes, then it started to spiral downwards. why? first, ethan suplee is scripted to act as a complete idiot confirming that very obviously by spewing out semi-random stuff in great expectations of it somehow becoming the next best joke.<br /><br />jaime pressly's got stunning looks, but if she thinks stretching lips to explore parts of the face to which they normally never go to and making strange grimaces to accentuate everything she says is hilarious, she's way off track. maybe she thought her character would be too flat, faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but made a flood of colors, overkill of spices and screams out loud for attention and it hurts my eyes, ears and intellect.<br /><br />i really, really wanted to love this show, like i said, the premise is great, (comes from the same shelf as the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain) and jason lee is doing a pretty good job here, along with some of the other actors but there is no way no how i would get 'sucked in' and forget that this is just a show, because pressly's and suplee's surreal, extreme characters abruptly wake me when they show up. it's worth to note that their characters and acting would be fine if this wasn't a 70 something-part series and if they didn't get that much screen time.
