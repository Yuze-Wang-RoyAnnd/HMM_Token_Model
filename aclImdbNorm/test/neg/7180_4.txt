this film just doesn't work. no two ways about it. i saw it for the first time back in '98 when it was released and i didn't like it. i just bought it on sale a couple of days ago, 'cause i thought "whatta hell, i'll give it a try". i don't regret for the money i put out for hamilton, but the fact remained the same.. this movie is pointless, dull and uninteresting.<br /><br />stormare is usually a delight, but that's when he's making films in the us. back home he doesn't do the trick. sure the movie is well made (if you forget the odd stock footage here'n'there), but in the end the only thing that really lifts hamilton above one star garbage, is hamill's turn as the bad guy hawkins. he seriously has fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments in the movie.. "swedish intelligence, huh? now there's a contradiction in terms" and when he allows hamilton to have a word or two with his wife over the phone towards the end of the flick. and that's really pretty much it.<br /><br />** / *****
