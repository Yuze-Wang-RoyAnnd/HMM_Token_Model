i am a huge randolph scott fan, so i was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film! the movie really belongs to robert ryan, who is the hero in the jam, and the one embroiled in the love triangle. good grief, gabby hayes gets more screen time than mr. scott in this movie!! for many viewers, that is not a problem, but i am from the walter brennan school of sidekicks, not gabby hayes...although i will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with randolph scott and john wayne.<br /><br />personally, i found the movie very slow going, with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot. by convoluted, i don't mean impossible to understand or figure out, i just mean too messy for its own good.<br /><br />the direction is uninspired, and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying come-uppance at the end. the whole movie comes across as fake, unrealistic, and poorly filmed.<br /><br />just so you don't think i can't find anything good here...<br /><br />on the plus side, anne jeffreys is very sexy in her all-too-brief parts of this film. not sure if it is actually her singing, or someone else, but whoever it was had a very pretty voice. ms. jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments. the script needed either a lot more of her, or to remove her character altogether. as it was, her nice few moments weren't enough to help the film.<br /><br />lastly, there is mr. scott. he looks fantastic in this film and is the no-nonsense lawman out to set things right. some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goody-goody perfect, but that's never bothered me at all. i'll take him goody-goody pre-1950, or gritty and violent post-1950...either way, randolph scott was a real western hero.<br /><br />it saddens me to have to say it, but i would have to recommend passing this film by, unless you are a die-hard fan...there are so many better scott films out there that this one won't be missed.
