i got subjected to this pile one wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law was watching it. i can't get over someone basically doing a remake of a crappy high budget hollywood flop ("the core" with washed up actors like luke perry). if the high budget one flopped, what makes people think doing the same movie 2 years later with no budget would go anywhere? i was laughing through most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was (in fact i am shocked it's not held up in legal rather than airing on tv), and how it was basically the script of the core just redone badly, which if you have seen "the core", you know why doing it worse is funny, since the core was already so bad it was funny.<br /><br />if you enjoy getting a laugh out of really bad movies, this one will be right up your alley. the only thing i can say, is that i wish luke perry was able to have a career, because he isn't a horrible actor.. he just lands horrible roles. crappy made for tv movies that will only run on daytime television is pretty much one step closer to the end for him, if it wasn't for 90210 he would have a career.
