what fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, made up of mean, obnoxious, spoiled kids, and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to being a parent?? i'm sorry, i don't get it. the one episode that i was barely able to stomach watching involved one of the kids demanding a bar mitzvah, with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money. of course, the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior has to have the biggest and bes-test party of all, and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event. the ditzy, brain dead, boy crazy teenage daughter bounces back and forth between wanting to be jewish and then catholic, when she see's the "cute" religious tutors.<br /><br />the one borderline "heartwarming" moment in the entire episode, was when the putz of a father, who has been convinced the entire time that the bar mitzvah is solely a money making scheme, see's the son studying his hebrew lessons, and is momentarily duped into thinking that perhaps, his conniving offspring is being sincere about the right of passage into manhood. this warm, fuzzy feeling is immediately ripped out of his chest when he informs junior that since he has not yet had a bris, a certain "procedure" needs to be performed. the bar mitzvah is called off, and the mother is out several thousands of dollars when the kid refuses to comply.<br /><br />this show is garbage, and i am saddened that i shall never get back the 23 minutes of my life i wasted watching this piece of crap, because nothing else was on tv ...
