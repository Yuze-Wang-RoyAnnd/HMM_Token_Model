definition of documentary: a work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration. the key word here is informative. i love they might be giants, and barely learned a thing about them.<br /><br />the interviews with all the celebrities were pretty much worthless. i don't care what sarah vowel thinks of anybody and syd straw was downright irritating. and is listening to people recite tmbg lyrics like they were supposed to be funny/interesting? it was neither. i think that was the problem: the movie spends time discussing tmbg's love for coffee. so what?? millions of people love coffee. was the presentation of the material funny? no! there were hints that both men are married, yet it was never discussed. and what about the solo material they did? what motivated them to do it? these type of questions are not addressed nor answered.<br /><br />i could go on and on with the negatives. i did find the segment on dial-a-song very interesting. if you want to learn about they might be giants, just buy a few cd's and listen. seriously. this movie is a gigantic disappointment. i can't believe so many folks gave it a 10. incredible.
