so, it's friday night and you want to go watch a movie...all you want is something entertaining, not too artsy, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. so, you pay $10 to watch the mod squad. the trailer to this movie should have tipped me off, but come on...it's three of hollywood's most beautiful people--eye candy. but that's about it...a string of moving prada ads. and what did hollywood producers forget? a plot. why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy? where are they? but, don't worry, after a while, you'll just stop caring. i was on the verge of walking out of this movie, because i thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall might have been more productive (and free), but by that time, it was over (90 minutes--it's only saving grace). so, still willing to waste $10? go, get yourself a nice hot meal.
