i concur with the other users comment. hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. i think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. if anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. it is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. i feel i lost intelligence from watching this. i used to have a little respect for chuck norris before i watched this but now i just feel bad. i bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for $9.99 and i can honestly say i would have been better off literally throwing the money away. forgive me jesus.
