even though this is the first film by the broken lizard group, it's the last one i saw. having mildly enjoyed super troopers, and managed to sit through the crap that is club dred and beerfest, i was surprised to hear they did an earlier film. now i didn't sit down with high hopes, but was hoping for a funny campus romp. my friend asked me to keep in mind they are younger (obviously) and its their first foray into film. i did and was still disappointed. not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the bl guys, they were ok. the whole film was tiresome, clich'ed and frankly boring. some of the other actors in the film were really poor at acting. and the rugby game didn't even resemble rugby. poor showing. they improved drastically with super troopers and have declined since. lets hope they get back on form with super troopers 2
