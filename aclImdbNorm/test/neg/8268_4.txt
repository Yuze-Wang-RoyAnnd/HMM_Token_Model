you just need to see this as a poorly executed anti abortion propaganda and you will realize just how bad it really is. the main message of this movie is that even the sickest of persons can't commit an abortion. if you ask that's not a long way away from blowing up abortion clinics. so this guy wants to kill some poor girl but he has to convince her to do an abortion first. what a load of crap. and the worst part is that he has an convincing argument (bringing a child into a loveless environment), but that is supposed to be dismissed because he's a freak anyway. and the part with the bible pushers...first they throw this girl out just because she explains someone stole her money (that rule must be in the bible somewhere) and then on the end they are some sort of angel like deus ex machina delivering the killer from evil by harassing him on his front yard. come on. other downpoints include a very confusing scenario (and i don't mean in a good way)...so this guy is just some psycho why? because his mother fed his some liver once? and i don't know about the rest of you but he seemed like the nicest person in the world throughout the whole move! even though he was a wearing girlie clothes, stealing money and taping girls in his car. if you forget the idiot story, this movie has a really great cinematography and bob hoskins was really great, and it has one of those funny little english cars in it. if it was actually about some psycho killer i'd give it a 7 at least.
