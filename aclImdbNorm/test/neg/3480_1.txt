being a fan of bad movies, i was thrilled to find a 3 pack of cr@ppy horror at best buy today. the set was cheap and included a terrible film called "the dark" that i actually remember seeing in the theater.<br /><br />the remaining 2 were equally as bad. "creatures from the abyss" being probably the worst of the bunch. since they were all bad that isn't saying much. but its stupidity, bad acting, terrible effects and retarded storyline actually made this one a lot of fun to watch. i was rolling on the floor with each new plot development. the discovery of the abandon ship, the missing crew, the realization that there was something terribly wrong!!! it was great!!! of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. omg!! i almost lost it!!! between that an the "monster cam", i have to say i enjoyed this film a lot.<br /><br />i am a fan of bad movies so i enjoyed it but in all fairness, i did have to give the movie a 1. it was awful... but if rubbish is your bag, at least rent this one... (yes the bad pun was intentional)
