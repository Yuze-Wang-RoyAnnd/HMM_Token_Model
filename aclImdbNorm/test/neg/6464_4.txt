not too long ago i bought a cheap vhs tape entitled "just rambling along" supposedly featuring laurel and hardy. being somewhat familiar with their output and not recognizing this title, i made the agonizing decision to part with a whole dollar and buy it. upon playing it, i identified the film as hop to it. of course, mr. laurel was nowhere in the cast, making the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. even worse, the quality is terrible. it looks like it was duped from an 8mm film source. it did have a somewhat appropriate musical score. actually, in all seriousness, the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of what the movie is like. in my opinion, it is a decent but unexceptional short. imdb should add just rambling along as an alternate title for this film, which incidentally was the name of a 1918 stan laurel film!
