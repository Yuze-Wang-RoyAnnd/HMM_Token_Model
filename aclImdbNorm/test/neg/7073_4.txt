teenager tamara (jenna dewan) has it rough. she's ridiculed by all the popular "kids" for being shy, bookish, frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft. all of the football players and cheerleaders are especially angry at her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school paper. on top of this, her dad's a drunk, her mom's not around and she's secretly in love with her supportive english teacher (matthew marsden). the popular kids set up a cruel prank to humiliate her, accidentally kill her during a struggle, bury the body in the woods and make a pact to keep silent. to their shock, the very next day tamara walks back into the classroom looking seductive and, uh, dressed to kill. yep, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved. she also takes time out to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her english teacher away from his wife (claudette mink), a guidance counselor at the school.<br /><br />acting and writing are strictly mediocre. you can also tell the people responsible for this have seen such movies as carrie (1976), hello mary lou: prom night ii (1987) and the craft (1996) because it borrows wholesale from all three of those superior films. there's some gore (a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing his eyeball probably being the best bit), a nasty vomiting scene and a few campy/witty one-liners. not an awful film by any means, but not much originality went into it either.
