tv director uses astral projection to kill people taking the form of the blue man.<br /><br />dull uninvolving horror film that kind of just sits there before your eyes and makes you wonder why you are watching it. i sat through the film to the end and i really can't give you more than a cursory account of what the film was about because i kept finding my attention diverted by other things.<br /><br />i can't really recommend this. i think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that i paid a dollar for the dvd as a double feature and i feel kind of ripped off.
