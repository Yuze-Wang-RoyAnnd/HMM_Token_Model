the original grudge (the original american remake) surprisingly pulled off just about everything you could do right with a ghost flick. it had suspense, dark and moody atmosphere, some good jolts, and some genuinely creepy images. the grudge 2 attempts all of these techniques, but ultimately fails, only showing us the same old stuff we saw in the first movie, as well as a messy storyline constantly switching from tokyo to california. it begins in tokyo with some schoolgirls who wander into the house, now heavily blocked by one strip of police tape. one of them comes face to face with a similar wide-eyed ghost girl while trapped in a closet. she gets out, screaming frantically and they all run out of there. next we cut to america where karen's sister is sent by their mother to japan to find and bring her back home. we eventually find ourselves following a very familiar concept involving a curious guy and girl investigating the history of a mysterious house. we cut back and forth to the girls from the beginning who are disappearing one by one as well as a young boy hearing strange noises in the next apartment at night, all leading up to a very unsatisfying ending. the "scare" scenes are dull and ineffective. like the ring 2, avoid this god awful sequel...
