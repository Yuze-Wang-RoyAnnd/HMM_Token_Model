ok, this movie wasn't good at all. video games aren't what i would brag on if i was over the age of 15. cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. i use my cell phone, i hope i don't loose my girlfriend in that. grease being the worst ever? ok, grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical. even if you don't like musicals, anyone would say grease is good. my brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so awful. i feel asleep.
