movies like these do not need sequels. part of the advantage of don bluth moving away from disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video, poorly animated cash-in sequels. but apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to "all dogs go to heaven," so we get this.<br /><br />charlie sheen replaces burt and he's not really as good. most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark, different or entertaining as the original.<br /><br />i feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap.<br /><br />please, no more sequels to kids films that don't need 'em.
