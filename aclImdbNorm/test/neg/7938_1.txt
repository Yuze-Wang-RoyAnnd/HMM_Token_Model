i am a huge fan of the original assault on precinct 13. the ice cream scene haunts me to this day. i'm 33 now and i still remember being horrified by it as a child. when i heard they were remaking it, i thought it might be good but when i saw the film, it's 100% not the same film. it's not a remake. it's a bad stolen idea. it was completely ruined. the cast, maria bello, laurence fishburne, ethan hawke, gabriel burne, john leguizamo and drea de matteo are all great actors but even they couldn't save this film. it was just wrong. even the setting was completely opposite. and how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door? why didn't help show up sooner? stupid. no sense.
