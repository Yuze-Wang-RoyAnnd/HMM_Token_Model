perry mason: the case of the glass coffin finds raymond burr defending david copperfield/rick blaine like magician peter scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. a trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of nancy grahn comes a tumbling out.<br /><br />nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her. first in a moment of drunken weakness, scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past.<br /><br />billy moses who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in grahn's home town. a little more action than usual for ken malansky, he almost gets himself killed. <br /><br />one big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics. the medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that scolari could not possibly have done the deed. the police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer. <br /><br />when you see who the killer is you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see how the investigating officer james mceachin got it wrong from the start. it kind of spoils this particular mason film.
