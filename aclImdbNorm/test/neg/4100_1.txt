this is a pitiful movie. what makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money put into a super predictable script and action.<br /><br />it's about some kind of monsters, by the way, and some kind of insects. don't expect an explanation of the plot. there is none. that might work, if there was something of interest, or characters we could care about. there isn't. everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other movies sci fi channel does.<br /><br />don't try to understand what some of the characters are saying. they speak gibberish, especially the annoying lead woman, whose accent is a sort of thick british that is harder to understand than any old british movie you may have seen. she's unintelligible.<br /><br />a lot of money is spent on some great sets and scenery, and that is the major crime of this movie, because it just isn't worth it.
