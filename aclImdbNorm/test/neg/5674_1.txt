this show is based on the concept that loud + obnoxious + repetition = funny. the comedic writing is non-existent, in fact i face serious repercussions by even comparing it to entertainment of any sort. here is the premise. two girls accidentally get their shenanigans posted on the internet and hilarity ensues after their initial success, they contrive the idea that they should make a web-cast to showcase their brilliance. <br /><br />ok, so where should i begin? let's start with the laugh track, the oft used but never successful reminder that, we the viewing audience should laugh. according to the foley guys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. we should all be dropping loads into our pants because of the brilliance of the humor placed before us. the laugh track seriously goes every few seconds. it quite possibly usurps scooby-doo for the king of laugh track over-use. <br /><br />then the in-your-face-shout-at-the-top-of-our-lungs-the-craziest-grouping-of- words-to-seem-silly trick is also employed with little to no success. whoa and let's not forget creating new words to sound funny trick. that is web-o-licious and poop-tastic? what the hell... <br /><br />finally, the acting. i can't entirely complain here. the actors are young and inexperienced, but this should and can be corrected by good professional help. because of the inexperience nick should be helping the actors define their craft. instead, in usual nick fashion, the actors are placed in front of the camera and told "act". which for the most part is robotic recitation of lines, missed timing and overall epic fail.<br /><br />the lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be funny. don't waste your time. this show is debasing to all of humanity
