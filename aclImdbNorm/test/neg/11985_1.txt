clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given uwe boll's track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce.<br /><br />the first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the horrible one-liners delivered by gi joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre.<br /><br />you will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point. you've already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history.<br /><br />next, enter absolute rubbish talent. the leading man has the same amount of charisma that you will find in garden slug.<br /><br />there is an awkward bit of contrived romance thrown in - this feels so wrong that you can only speculate why this scene was conjured up in the first place. normally the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject some humanity and sympathy into otherwise cardboard cut-out characters - here it backfires on all cylinders.<br /><br />the effects are bad and the action unbelievably boring. where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget restraints - here it just seems like everything was spent on catering.<br /><br />there are in fact no redeeming features here - not even the "it's so bad it is almost good" applies. it's just bad, and in a bad way.<br /><br />our hero questions the leading starlet about the night they spent together and how she would rate him. she gives him 2 out of 10. i give the whole affair 1 (i'd have gone for 0 if that were possible).<br /><br />don't waste your time on this dribble, there is plenty of crap cinema out there, which exceeds this ridiculous rumble in the jungle.<br /><br />oh and finally, the movie has little to nothing at all to do with the popular game far cry (at best it is extremely loosely based on it).<br /><br />horrible, move along!
