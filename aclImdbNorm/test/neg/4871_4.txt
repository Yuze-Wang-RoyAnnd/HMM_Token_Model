1st watched 2/25/2002 - 4 out of 10(dir-george p. cosmatos): predictable action thriller where any frequent movie goer could guess what was coming next. charlie sheen is the good old boy to the president who just happens to be not liked by the rest of the presidential staff. of course, he gets involved in a situation where he's framed over and over again and he has one friend in the white house, played by sutherland, who naturally doesn't stay that way for very long. his other friend is a reporter played by linda hamilton(who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role), and of course his biggest and bestest friend is the president himself(sam waterston) who stays his pal till the end despite everyone else being killed around him. brainless yet action-packed meaningless trife despite loads and loads of acting talent(all pretty much wasted.)
