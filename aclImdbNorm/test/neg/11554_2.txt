having lived in michigan's upper peninsula (30 miles from escanaba) in the mid-1990s, i was eager to see this film. it begins promisingly enough, with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of u.p. life. but jeff daniels apparently was not content with a low-key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people. instead, he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical/supernatural elements. although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the u.s., this is not it.
