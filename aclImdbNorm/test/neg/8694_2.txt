it is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is in play, you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer, and on the cutting edge of quality. if your intention is to aim for second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? it is with that, i wonder why this version of the ten commandments was written, produced, and aired. i would ask the producers, "what were you thinking? were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit?" if perhaps the producers were thinking, "we want to examine this biblical story from another point of view..." then i would say "ok, i watched the show, now what's the point of view?" the premise of this "possible point of view theory" eludes me. i can generally watch programs, and (right or wrong) at least get a sense of what the creators were trying to accomplish. not so, here. i recognize names such as "robert halmi" (the producer) and i can associate his work with some eye catching product; tin man, earthsea, flash gordon, jason and the argonauts. low budget entertainment based on myth, history and comic book entertainment. a perfect genre for sci-fi channel. so i still have to ask robert halmi..."what was the point of this ten commandments, what were you thinking?"
