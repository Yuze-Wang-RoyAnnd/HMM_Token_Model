director and playwright richard day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by rock hudson's real-life dilemma from the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips (and keep him working). wispy-thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by shag. the dialogue isn't very clever, and there's some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work (spitting out food, etc.). still, when a serious tone comes over the final act, it is handled with great taste--and is far more welcomed by the viewer than all the klutzy silliness. matt letscher does good work as movie hero/male whore guy stone, but are his experiences here enough to strengthen his character, or would he be right back at the bar the next night? the movie seems not to know--or care. day wants to get off a few one-liners and one carefully written pro-gay speech--a plea for tolerance--but he has no other agenda. for audiences who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow on this thing can look like nothing more than a prank. *1/2 from ****
