once again, the posters lied to me.<br /><br />the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? when i read the synopsis for this movie, i was expecting to see a townful of grotesques, every man-jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol, peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation; into such a "den of vice" would come the clean-shaven hero, shining gabriel. instead, the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expect.<br /><br />the first few minutes of the film showed us that middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can, whether fiddling a little to make ends meet, drinking to forget the pain, or watching cock-fighting (chickens, not penises) to while away the boredom. in other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary.<br /><br />the only (deliberate?) grotesque in the piece was gabriel, the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by macfadyen, whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. if i were kind, i would suggest that the paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith. unfortunately, brian kirk is so inept a film-maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie, leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty-plus minutes of dark, hackneyed tedium. my only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of "guess the accent" broken up with rounds of "spot the location." are we surprised that gaybo ends up stealing his brother's child and suffocating his father? of course not; he's a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. all the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie, but i suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to.<br /><br />the northern ireland film and television commission have a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise. the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace "superman returns" as the worst film of 2006; one hell of an achievement.<br /><br />v1:20061114 v2:20080107
