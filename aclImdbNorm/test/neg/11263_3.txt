this is bad movie. there is no denying it as much as i'd like to. tommy lee jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him, and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality.<br /><br />somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be counteracted if they were to hire every single workhorse actor in the business, unfortunately even truly, deeply talented actors like goodman, beatty, sarsgaard, gammon, steenburgen, macdonald, pruitt taylor vince, and lest we forget mr. jones himself can't fix the wooden dialogue, and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />in fact at one point i looked up, sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that i was 51 minutes into it.<br /><br />perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story. other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture. *if you haven't seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem tantalizing and know that it is not, you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie.<br /><br />the most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie "heaven's prisoners" starring alec baldwin in the same role carried by tommy lee jones in this movie. i may have to watch it now, first to see if it is as bad as in the electric mist, and second because i can't seem to (no matter how hard i try) break my man crush on alec baldwin.
