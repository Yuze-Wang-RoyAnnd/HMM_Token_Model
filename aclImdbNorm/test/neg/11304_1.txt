do not see "mr. magoo." it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. leslie nielson was not funny in it. he has not been funny since the naked gun movies. well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a naked gun movie! the movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. nothing in the entire movie was funny. the first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old magoo cartoons. i wish the movie would have stayed that way.
