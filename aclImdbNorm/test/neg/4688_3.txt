for the uninitiated, almost any andy milligan film is a shock, but despite the fact that i've seen many of his films, this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddiness.<br /><br />this is, of course, milligan's take on the sweeney todd tale, done with period costumes (but not necessarily period hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual headache-inducing camera-work & grainy quality. as for the gore, well, the version i saw may have been cut some, for there's not a lot, for a film with "bloodthirsty" in the title. the best indication of subversive film-making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim's tit.<br /><br />so, while i will still treasure this piece of, uh, work, on my video shelf, it's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though. recommended for only the foolhardy & morbidly curious. 3 out of 10.
