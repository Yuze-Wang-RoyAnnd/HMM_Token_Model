best thing i can say about this porno-horror film is: boobies boobies boobies !<br /><br />beyond that, this film is made by some hindu/indian guy with some background in porn films or such .<br /><br />plot: talk-show host and girlfriend are stalked by a psychopath who is angry over the plight of the homeless and takes it out on, you guessed it, beautiful real-estate agent ladies ! (films like these are why the slasher films of the 80's got a rep for misogyny)<br /><br />this film is not really a slasher, but has the same sort of implausibilities and stereotypes: the dumb-ass cops, the villain is an old white male, and the women are busty babes . <br /><br />if you like porno-horror, this is your movie, otherwise stay away . (adrienne fans will get to see her sagging breasts for a second or two)
