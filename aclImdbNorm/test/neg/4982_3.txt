good things out of the way first:<br /><br />underdog's voice acting was fine. but jason lee being awesome himself, that really is no surprise.<br /><br />peter dinklage (barsinister) also did fine, for what trash was given to him. he acted the part shockingly well. and so did patrick warburton, the moronic assistant. now, it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well, i actually liked the character better than the protagonists. the lines given to him were childish but witty.<br /><br />however. alex neuberger did awful and hope he never acts again. his "scream" was so disgustingly fake. silence. silence. "aaahhhhhhh". in the scene where he hears the dog talk, an "oh no, impossible!" would have sufficed in place of the pathetic fake scream.<br /><br />and then there was the girl and her female dog that chased patrick's character cad on the roof. at first this makes sense, she's a "reporter." a school reporter but still an inquiring mind regardless. but why, why the hell did she carry her dog around? that was worthless and the damn dog didn't even say anything other than a heartless "oh, underdog!" her presence was extremely unnecessary.<br /><br />overall, the script was pathetic. the only reason i give this movie a 3 is barsinister, his assistance, and underdog's voice.
