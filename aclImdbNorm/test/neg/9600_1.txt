i am a lover of bad movies. i own "r.o.t.o.r." and "boa vs. python" and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as "troll 2" and "what's up superdoc?" but "storm trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies. it's just lame. the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right. everything about this movie is stupid. when the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up, there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction. "judge, jury, and executioner," "the perfect cop...but they went too far," i mean, come on, why do people bother making these movies anymore? r.o.t.o.r. makes it because it is hysterically awful, but storm trooper is just a waste of cinema because it isn't even bad enough to be so bad it's worth watching. this belongs in someone's home movies collection, something they can be sort of proud of, but that is all. i am p*ssed off it was on an hbo channel (with only 1-star, which is why i watched it) because it didn't belong there. even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie. it is shameful.
