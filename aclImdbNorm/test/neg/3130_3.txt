dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i've ever seen. not good, but definitely strange.<br /><br />a driver-less stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed. it's scheduled to go on, but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the cheyennes on the warpath out there. but linda darnell, regis toomey, john lund, whit bissell, and ward bond each have their reasons for going on. and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert, is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team.<br /><br />of course the cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover. who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film.<br /><br />dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j. yates pulled the plug on his little studio. westerns were their specialty, but normally of the kind roy rogers made. this would not have been a rogers product. <br /><br />in fact it's beyond belief. the characters aren't ground in any kind of reality. whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim, but robertson discovers it's iron pyrites, fool's gold. toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst. darnell is after a cheating manager of her's, but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him. lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for, but has to bring him in alive. for that he'd require help, but doesn't have any.<br /><br />but the worst is ward bond who's a united states senator on his own peace mission to the cheyennes. in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. he's really quite the fatuous fool, but i think that might have attracted him to the role.<br /><br />i tried to get into dakota incident, but couldn't. and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least.<br /><br />give it three stars for the cast involved.
