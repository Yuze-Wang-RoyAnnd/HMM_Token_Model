i've read all the dave robicheaux novels and consider james lee burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer. i've also visited new iberia and much of acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. needless to say, i greatly anticipated seeing "in the electric mist," especially since i thought tommy lee jones would be terrific as robicheaux.<br /><br />i was greatly disappointed. the story was very choppy; the interplay with the "ghosts of confederate dead" was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and tommy lee jones was doleful, expressionless and difficult to understand as dr. the best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my "ditto" to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old made-for-tv movies. i expected jill st. john or cameron mitchell to show up at any time.<br /><br />the location settings were accurate, and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous, smoky juke joints and eerie above-ground graveyards of south louisiana. too bad the story's disjointed presentation and tommy lee's sub-par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region.<br /><br />next to final comment: in the novels, dave robicheaux's nickname is "streak," because of the distinct streak of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (similar to how the sopranos' paulie walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile.) tommy lee had no such streak in this film, probably because the editors are james lee burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing mr. jones's poor imitation of dave robicheaux.<br /><br />final comment: while i generally find alec baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles, he was by far a better robicheaux in "heaven's prisoners" than tommy lee was in "in the electric mist." also, heaven's prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie.<br /><br />"in the electric mist" is okay to watch when one feels like "veging out" and there's nothing better on tv. but then, so are infomercials.
