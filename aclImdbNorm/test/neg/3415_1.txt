this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player! michael dudikoff and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love, yet they are total opposites. she is ambitious and organized, while he is laid back and totally scatter brained.<br /><br />in this movie, bad guys are chasing jersey bellini (dudikoff's character). this opens the door to bad godfather impressions, ludicrous fight scenes, and tony curtis playing the most effeminate looking mob boss i have ever seen! the ending has to be the most...unbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time. i would believe the terminator, even the matrix, has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending! this movie just reeks of cheapness. the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous. yet, the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public. i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated. no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over.
