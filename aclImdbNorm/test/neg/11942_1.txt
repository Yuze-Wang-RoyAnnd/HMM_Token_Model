i recall years back, michael douglas wanted his wife, catherine zeta-jones, to be in a romantic film because he felt his wife had all the goods. no doubt she does, but not in this film. a colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. this was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be, boring and a huge disappointment. didn't even watch the whole film, torture. catherine zeta-jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen, move around, present a dish but this wasn't the food network, nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest brewing, where was the chemistry. the poor slob on the second floor of her building trying all the ploys to connect and no character development there. the loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness. the sister's daughter just was plopped here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in, not. just a waste of movie time. the promoters certainly did their job to put this lack-luster film on all the networks tempting you with all kinds of teasers. sorry to say, don't spend a dime.
