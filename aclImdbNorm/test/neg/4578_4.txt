this movie defines the word "confused". all the actors stay true to the script. more's the pity, because the acting is fine, but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytic random ideas. the pacing is mind-numbingly slow, and the soft-focus-lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly. i give it 4 out of 10.
