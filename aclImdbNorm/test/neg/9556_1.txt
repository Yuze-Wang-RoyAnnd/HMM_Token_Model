i was on a british airways flight from london to new york when i saw this movie. i wish i could have fallen asleep. the story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did.<br /><br />gary, played by andy garcia, was such an unlikable character that i found it hard to be supportive of him. andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie.<br /><br />andie macdowell did a fine job with her portrayal of linda, gary's romantic interest. i can not say anything bad about andie, i always enjoy her acting. the problem here is that the romance between andy and andie is so far fetched and unbelievable. the two do not make a good pair on the big screen.<br /><br />the end of the movie was almost as much of a let down as the movie itself. a nod from the pope and all is forgiven, come on. the event that allows this movie to have a some what happy ending and that the writers would expect us to accept it is pathetic. gary does not change and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation get better.<br /><br />there are tons of great movies that should be seen before this one. don't waste your time.<br /><br />
