it is inconceivable to me how anyone could have enjoyed or laughed at this movie. i'd say it's the worst movie i've seen in years and i see a lot of them. maybe i've forgotten junior high? it's also very hard to believe that this is the same jeff daniels to did such a brilliant performance of george washington in the crossing. seems like ever since he did dumber, he's gone into the tank. can you believe he even wrote and directed this junk?
