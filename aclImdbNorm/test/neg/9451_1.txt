this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. even for a b movie this is down right awful. after reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it. but all the bad reviews were so right. i totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. i'm a huge sci-fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow. definlty do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie. they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter. you have been warned.
