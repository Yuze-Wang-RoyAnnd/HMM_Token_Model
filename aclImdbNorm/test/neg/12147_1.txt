his has to surely be one of the worst gay-themed films of all time. who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. bad sound - bad script - gestures so overboard that they defy reality. a nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes.<br /><br />after seeing other low budget films similarly made i was prepared for something innovative - but not plain pathetic.<br /><br />parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe.<br /><br />and the dvd - no menu access; its worse than a vhs tape. once you start you have to watch the whole thing through - luckily the fast forward button works - with this film and dvd nothing else does.
