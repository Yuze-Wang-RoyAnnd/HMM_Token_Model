this film is probably the worst movie i have watched in a very long time. the acting is so wooden a door could have done a better job. the plot is laughable and shallow and the actual "rugby" shown is a far cry from reality. i still don't get the "haka" as portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment. i am not a kiwi but i do know that the haka can only be performed by someone of maori origin and not by an all-american white boy.<br /><br />i am assuming that this was made for the american audience so the shallowness and "disney end'" is excusable but there was hardly any attempt to point out the basic rules of the game apart from the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of an american football game and gets everyone playing rugby instead. the only thing good about this film were the end credits. it would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into your eyeballs.
