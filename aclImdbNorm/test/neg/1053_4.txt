most lorne michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. "tommy boy" is a character right from "snl" - a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn't know anything.<br /><br />david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role. he's paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddy's business.<br /><br />the plot, for starters, is really faulty. the whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be "funny" together.<br /><br />the movie's biggest "influence" is the 1987 comedy classic "planes, trains & automobiles." that movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled. it's basic, yeah - a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. but it's real, dammit. it makes all the difference. the characters are real, the situations are far more real. "tommy boy" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don't care about what's happening on-screen. "pta" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - "tommy boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead, then awakens and wrecks their car.<br /><br />the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from "pta" and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin/john candy movie.<br /><br />farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - i've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind. spade's given very little to do, serving as the movie's most thankless character.<br /><br />dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddy's business. the ending is a joke, and not in a "har-har funny" way. more like a "oh god are they serious?!" way.<br /><br />some people dig it, that's cool. but i just can't get into it, nor do i appreciate all the stuff it "borrows" from - not just counting "pt&a" - without any credit whatsoever.
