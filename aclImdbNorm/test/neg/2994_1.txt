i can't think of anything, i repeat, anything positive about this "movie"! the whole 1 hour 45 minute movie could be shrunken into a short 5-minute movie! in most scenes, there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie! all you see is someone in the background walking around or watching tv with no specific subject or even talk what so ever! i just feel i've wasted 105 minutes of my, my family's and my friends' weekend for nothing! if a movie is poorly made or the scenario isn't great that's whole another story, at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about distant, i just have to call it a "movie" because it was motion pictures recorded by a camera.<br /><br />if you haven't seen it, imagine a 105-min long movie based on two-three lines of story! what will you end up with? 5% of content and 95% of fillers! that's exactly how "distant" was at least for us! actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them, they barely talked or showed any special emotions! i picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what i read on the back of its cover. i'm still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie.
