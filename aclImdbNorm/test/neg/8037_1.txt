i will repeat - what a stupid scenario.<br /><br />is there anything new inside? i don't know who have wrote this. but i believe this guy have watch all hollywood -children -family -teens movies ever made... all scenes and dilouges u can see in everywhere. why do u people making this movies? children's like an adults? they like money gold cars... and they are positives? they have lucky... and emotions of course... without it can be done. o the young actors - wow :-). i do like when is camera concentrated on their nice faces? what a crap... there is 90% better children movies that this one! this is not creative or funny movie. this is simply nothing.<br /><br />d.
