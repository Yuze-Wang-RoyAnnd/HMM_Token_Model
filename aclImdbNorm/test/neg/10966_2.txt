the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting it in the old west. except it's not the real old west, of course. it's some sort of future west, in a world where some apocalypse has, as apocalypses are known to do, killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies. it's zombie virus time again, folks, and you know what that means? get bitten and become one of them.<br /><br />so, into this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. he's a bounty-hunter, getting paid for taking care of zombies. it's not exactly clear who is providing the funds, but it seems a little cottage industry of zombie-hunting has emerged. but, as the trailer tells us, there's a problem. they are running out of zombies. the only way to keep on earning is to infect new towns and cities with the virus.<br /><br />i think that's not a bad idea for a film. but unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people pawing at windows to make a good zombie film. what we actually get is a clint eastwood clone (the actor's even called clint, for crying out loud) and his "hilarious" sidekick, trying to bag zombies while trailing some still-living bad guys to get some big reward. the whole subplot about infecting other towns is only mentioned in passing, over half-way through the film. instead, there's a lot of western movie clich'es, poor zombie make-up and some world-class bad acting. really bad. the sort that wouldn't even make it onto hollyoaks. both hero and villain chomp on cigars, quips are thrown, people get bitten. as the movie lurches to a conclusion, the only thing worth wondering is whether it's going to end with the clich'e of the hero being the only man alive, having killed the one he loves, or the clich'e of him turning into a zombie in the final frame. (it's the first one, by the way) this film was written and directed by gerald nott. it's the only thing he has done and, hopefully, it will be his last. at the start of the film there is a caption that reads "nott entertainment". at least they got one thing right.
