i will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that i thought it stunk. the great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. no telling what you will come out of the film with. for me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. there was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to pacino. the meeting and the airport. other than that, well, what a waste of time. utterly. pacino is just doing the same thing over and over and over, he would have been better served by taking the performance down about five notches at about the level of his prot'eg'e. everybody always says, but this movie could have been so much better. sure they all could have been. but really most of them just should never have been made. including this one.
