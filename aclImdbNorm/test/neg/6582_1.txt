i know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great, but i have to disagree.<br /><br />sure, it's a good book! it was actually one of my favorites when i was verrry little. but it's just not meant for theaters. maybe for a little half-hour short, but i don't see how they can turn a short kiddie book into a whole feature film.<br /><br />it is a cute movie, but i would only recommend it for really little kids. older kids will have no interest it. adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones. but anyone ages 7-adult will have a snore-fest.<br /><br />sorry if you disagree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
