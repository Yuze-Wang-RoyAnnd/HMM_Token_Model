yep, edward g. gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world. first he's an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair (played passionately, albeit briefly by deforrest kelly), then he's so filled with remorse his only solace is the bottle. throw in a jaded romance, a genuinely rapid descent into penury and no qualms about who he defends, and next thing you know -- shazam! black leg lawyer (god i love that phrase). he sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair. yawn.<br /><br />but really, the courtroom action is pure melodrama. see him punch out a witness, see him drink poison, see him argue passionately as he clutches a bullet hole in his breast. be prepared for melodrama.<br /><br />the hoot of the film though, is jayne russell. with curves defying the laws of gravity and an iq approached absolute zero, she is something to see. even sings a bit.
