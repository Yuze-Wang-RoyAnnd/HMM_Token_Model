i have only seen this movie once, when i was about 14 years old, but i was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th division. being from oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th, i would like to see it released on a dvd. i may sound a little bias but the 45th division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. the history channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about ww2 and korea but you rarely hear it mention the 45th. one of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the indian code talkers at work and the puzzled look on the german soldiers faces when they could not understand this language. i am glad that all of the native american code talkers are getting the recognition they deserve.
