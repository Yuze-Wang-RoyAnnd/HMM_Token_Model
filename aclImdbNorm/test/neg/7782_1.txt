look no further, this is it, the worst movie ever made. there may be others that are tied, but there are none worse. there can't be.<br /><br />i found this movie on a clearance-sale laserdisc for $3.25, and thought no movie with those actors could possibly not be worth that price. turns out it's worth triple that - as the minimum they should have paid me to watch it.<br /><br />i'm virtually certain that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie, they substituted someone else, someone younger and cuter, to make it look more appealing. whatever "plot" there was amounted to about three minutes of actual movie, the rest is filler. and i don't mean the kind of filler that you only realize is filler when it's over, or that is some kind of eye candy you don't mind having there, i mean filler that has you thinking about your shopping list. i think the "music" must have been made up by somebody with a friend who had a radio he listened to once. it's terrible.<br /><br />if there were a shot of a nice mountain, a river valley, a forest, anything, there would be something positive about this movie. there isn't. even with the speeder button on the remote, even at top laserdisc speed, you can't get it over with fast enough.<br /><br />after years of thinking about commenting on movies, being tempted but not registering with imdb, i finally cracked, because i had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker down as far as possible.<br /><br />the guidelines ask that you "focus on the content and context". i can't. there isn't enough content to focus on, and that's exactly my point. sometimes bad is just bad, and this movie would have to be much better than it is to aspire to being only that.
