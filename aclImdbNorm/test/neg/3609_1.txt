thinking that it could only get better was the worst assumption i ever made....<br /><br />drivvle does not describe this movie appropriately enough!<br /><br />not only is the plot thin, but i get more emotional acting from my pet fish!<br /><br />it was a shame to see pete postlethwaite, whom i respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with...<br /><br />i think that a cardboard cut out of stephen baldwin would have done a better job , and in fact have been more animate.<br /><br />avoid at all costs! this could really be hazardous to your health!
