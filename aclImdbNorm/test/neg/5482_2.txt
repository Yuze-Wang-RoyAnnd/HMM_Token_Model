it's 2 stars only because they put a lot of work in making this game look good. i played plenty of good and bad games and i think this game has the dullest story i was ever forced to listen. the best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversations (but no, you must listen to them talking for 10 minutes) and just continue doing the same things over and over again. climb the building, save the citizen, go kill some dude. it's all the same! ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination.<br /><br />i'm a huge fan of prince of persia series (first 3). the story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time. i don't even hate prince of persia 4. but i think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for assassin's creed should be banned to write another thing for the rest of his life.<br /><br />boring story and same missions over and over again! if just one of these two things was good the game would be worth playing.
