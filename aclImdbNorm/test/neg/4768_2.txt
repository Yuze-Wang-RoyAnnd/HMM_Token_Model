i've watched a number of wixel pixel and sub rosa extreme movies lately, and have found a lot to like about them.<br /><br />this sre movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others i've seen. perhaps that's because this is a comedy/horror movie rather than straight horror, and perhaps it's also because the humor didn't register with me very well.<br /><br />it's a little less than seventy minutes long, and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning. there are some outtakes, goofs, and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll.<br /><br />sre movies do tend to be short, and tend to feel padded out in spite of that. this is no exception, with some scenes that tend to go on too long.<br /><br />the story involves a poor kid in christmastown, california who'd been picked on by all his classmates. he'd had one shoe stolen, and unable to replace it, he was dubbed "oneshoe mcgroo." due to an obsession with pirates, his parents gave him an eyepatch for christmas with a christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatch.<br /><br />many of the classmates are killed, and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do. they're picked off one by one by mcgroo, who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringing.<br /><br />the characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes, like the nerd named dorkus, etc. there's an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head. this reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director rinse dream.<br /><br />the picture quality is good, and there are a lot of extras. but basically a pretty silly movie.<br /><br />oh well, i guess you can never have too many christmas horror movies. still, there are a lot of other needy holidays.
