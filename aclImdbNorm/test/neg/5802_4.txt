first of all, i'd like to say that i really enjoyed this movie. however, that said, i can't say that it was a "good" movie. i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations (something i've learned to do). i'm glad i did, because the plot and development wasn't stellar. the jokes were low-grade humor. but, i was in the right mindset to enjoy them.<br /><br />i wasn't the only one. in fact, the entire theatre was laughing out loud. i didn't hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close. i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing! but again, i have to warn you, grandma's boy is not a top-quality film. it is a funny (albeit low-brow) movie, and if you go with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. oh, and don't take kids to it.
