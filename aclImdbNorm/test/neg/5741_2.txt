i like vampire movies, i like b-movies, i love b vampire movies. but this one has nearly nothing going for it. some of the acting is horrible, especially by 3 of the male leads. the story is not particular interesting. at a relative short 88 minutes it still seems too long and you'll find yourself fast-forwarding quite a bit. there are an awful lot of kung-fu vampire attacks. sound cool? it isn't when it's done on a low budget. it gets repetitive very quickly. there is some minor blood and gore, nothing to get excited about. there some good wire work where you can see the wires. it has some good landscapes being filmed in puerto rico. <br /><br />not worth the rental
