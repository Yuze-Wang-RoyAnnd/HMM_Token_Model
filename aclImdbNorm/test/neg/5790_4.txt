i learned little of significance from this film that i did not already know from cnn and the new york times. (and i did not follow the enron case obsessively as did some others.) the film did a very poor job of explaining what "business" enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by andy fastow. it also significantly underplayed the role played by arthur andersen and vinson & elkins in validating practices that were afterwards found to be illegal. nor did it go as far as it might have in exploring what the "investors" -- all those prominent bankers -- thought they were doing. with the 24 hour a day cable networks, the discovery channel and the history channel, documentaries have proliferated. i've seen many in the past year that were better than this one.
